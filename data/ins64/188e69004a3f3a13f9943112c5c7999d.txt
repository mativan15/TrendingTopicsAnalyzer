Russia and the West are walking into a "long, dark tunnel" with their rising rhetoric about a nuclear confrontation, and China should exercise wisdom and statecraft to avoid going down the same path, Singapore's former foreign minister George Yeo has said. Characterising the conflict in Ukraine - following Russia's February invasion of its smaller neighbour - as a "proxy war", Yeo said China's entry into the fray would put the world in jeopardy. "With the incorporation of the four [Ukrainian] oblasts to the Russian federation, the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, I fear that Russia and the US and Europe are walking into a long, dark tunnel from which they cannot easily reverse," Yeo said in an interview on Talking Post with the Post's chief news editor Yonden Lhatoo.
