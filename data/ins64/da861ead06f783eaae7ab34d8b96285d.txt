Alex Caruso has a simple goal for his second season with the Chicago Bulls: Stay on the court.

Caruso became an instant favorite in Chicago because of his energetic defense and eagerness to chase loose balls. But the guard was available for only 41 games last season and dedicated his summer to preparing his body to shoulder a heavier load in 2022-23.

'It's really important for me to be out there playing,' Caruso said. 'I don't think I change the way I play — that's what got me here. That's why the Bulls want me on the team.
