Jeremy Hunt said that the Government went ‘too far, too fast' with its mini-budget.
The newly-installed Chancellor issued a statement late tonight.
He said: ‘My focus is on growth underpinned by stability. The drive on growing the economy is right – it means more people can get good jobs, new businesses can thrive and we can secure world class public services. But we went too far, too fast.
‘We have to be honest with people and we are going to have to take some very difficult decisions both on spending and on tax to get debt falling, but at the top of our minds when making these decisions will be how to protect and help struggling families, businesses and people.
