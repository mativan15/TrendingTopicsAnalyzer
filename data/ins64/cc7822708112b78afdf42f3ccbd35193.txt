The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a man's petition seeking to be appointed as the President of India. Asking the registry to 'not entertain his plea', a bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Hima Kohli said the petition is 'frivolous' and an 'abuse of the process of the court'.The plea, filed by Kishore Jagannath Sawant who claimed to be an environmentalist for the past 20 years, said he was not allowed to contest the recent Presidential polls.
