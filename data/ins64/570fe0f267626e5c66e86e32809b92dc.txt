By Sabela Ojea Simply Good Foods Co. on Friday posted a better-than-expected rise in earnings and revenue in its fourth quarter after it increased prices nearly 10%, which offset currency headwinds and higher costs related to its supply chain. The company, which makes snack bars, protein shakes and other products under the Atkins and Quest brands, said net income for the three months ended Aug. 27 rose to $30.1 million, or 30 cents a share, compared with $18.2 million, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier.
