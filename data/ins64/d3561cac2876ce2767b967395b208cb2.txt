Moscow has told the Philippine government that it should honour a $215m deal to buy 16 Russian military helicopters, which the country's former President Rodrigo Duterte cancelled due to fears of possible US sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Russian ambassador Marat Pavlov told reporters in Manila on Wednesday night that the Philippine government had not yet officially notified Moscow of its decision to cancel the purchase agreement, and a Russian company would continue to manufacture the Mi-17 helicopters that had been ordered.
