These days it's easy to simply buy an index fund, and your returns should (roughly) match the market. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. To wit, the Compass Group PLC (LON:CPG) share price is 12% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market decline of around 2.1% (not including dividends) in the same period. That's a solid performance by our standards! The longer term returns have not been as good, with the stock price only 0.5% higher than it was three years ago.
