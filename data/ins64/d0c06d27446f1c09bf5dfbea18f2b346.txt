georgeclerk/E+ via Getty Images Investment thesis Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) is one of those conservative companies that can be bought and held for decades. Its cash payout ratio is very low thanks to stable profit margins and responsible use of its resources, which has allowed the company to acquire other companies over the years, integrate them, and thus increase overall net sales and cash from operations year after year. This growth, both in terms of net sales and in terms of cash from operations, has boosted the P/S ratio.
