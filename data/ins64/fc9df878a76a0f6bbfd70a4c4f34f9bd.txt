HOUSTON -- They meet again. The Astros and Yankees, the top two teams in the American League who have forged a strong rivalry the last few years, are set to clash in the AL Championship Series for the third time since 2017, with Game 1 set for Wednesday at Minute Maid Park.
It will be a quick turnaround for the Yankees, who beat the Guardians in Game 5 of the AL Division Series on Tuesday night in New York and immediately had to fly to Houston. The Astros have been off since beating the Mariners, 1–0, in an 18-inning marathon Saturday in Seattle in Game 3 of the ALDS.
