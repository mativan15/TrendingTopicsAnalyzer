Once upon a time, they ran the country together. Now former vice president Mike Pence has suggested he might not lend his support to his old boss, Donald Trump, if Trump runs in the next presidential election.

Asked whether he'd back Trump in 2024, Pence took a long pause and, with a wry smile, told an audience at Georgetown University late Wednesday: "Well, there might be somebody else I'd prefer more."

It's possibly the heaviest hint yet that the former veep might put himself in the running instead - fueling the possibility of a clash that has been the subject of Washington speculation since the tensions between the two leaders in the last days of the Trump administration.
