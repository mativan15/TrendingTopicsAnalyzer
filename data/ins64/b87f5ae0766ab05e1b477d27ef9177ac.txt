New York Attorney General Letitia James is not seeking criminal charges against Donald Trump.

James appears poised, however, to seek the so-called 'corporate death penalty' against the NY-based Trump Organization.

In signaling she will do so, the AG has cited 'persistent' financial fraud at the golf resort and real estate empire.

New York's attorney general, Letitia "Tish" James, is poised to give Donald Trump a Memorial Day-worthy grilling, thanks to a court ruling Thursday ordering that he, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump Jr.
