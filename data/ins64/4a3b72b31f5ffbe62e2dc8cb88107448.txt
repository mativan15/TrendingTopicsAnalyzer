An online report from an F-150 Electric driver indicates his range was cut in half when he towed an Airstream. He got only 0.8 miles/kWh compared to 1.5-1.8 driving without it. What you may not know is that the smaller sedans like the Tesla TSLA Model 3 tend to get 4 miles/kWh, which is 5 times the mileage of that towing truck.
