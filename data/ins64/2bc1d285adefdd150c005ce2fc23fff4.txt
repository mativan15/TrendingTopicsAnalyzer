Bril was a champion Dutch boxer and Holocaust survivorSitting in his boxing gym just outside Amsterdam, former Dutch champion Barry Groenteman is reminiscing about the times he used to visit his grandmother. When she was living in a retirement home and he would go to see her, he'd often come across an older man "who was always shadowboxing: in the hall, with the nurses".Groenteman continues: "He'd show me his ring, with the Star of David on it. And my grandmother would whisper: 'That's Ben Bril.'"For the young Groenteman, it was an introduction to a man who would have a huge impact on him and whose story he feels compelled to tell.
