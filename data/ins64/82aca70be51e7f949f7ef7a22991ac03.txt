United States consumer confidence edged lower in May as Americans' view of their present and future prospects dimmed in the midst of persistent inflation.
The Conference Board said on Tuesday that its consumer confidence index dipped to 106.4 in May — still a strong reading — from 108.6 in April.
The business research group's present situation index, which measures consumers' assessment of current business and labour conditions, also fell in May to 149.6 from 152.9 in April.
The expectations index, based on consumers' six-month outlook for income, business and labour market conditions, also declined in May, to 77.
