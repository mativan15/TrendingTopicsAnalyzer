gorodenkoff Investment Thesis Atlas Air Worldwide (NASDAQ:AAWW) conducts its business in aviation services and the outsourcing of aircraft. The company is experiencing solid demand for assets and services due to sustaining shifts in consumer demand for long-term dedicated airlifts. AAWW has recently entered into long-term dry lease & AMCI agreements which I believe can accelerate the company's growth and can add to the revenues of the company and profits significantly. It can also help the company to attract new customers, and further increase their areas of operations.
