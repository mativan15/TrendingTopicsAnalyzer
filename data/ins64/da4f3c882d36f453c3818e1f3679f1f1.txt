The central government on Sunday withdrew its May 27 advisory in which it had asked citizens to share only masked versions of their Aadhaar cards with organisations in order to prevent its misuse. The Centre has said that the Bengaluru Regional Office of UIDAI had issued the earlier advisory in the context of an attempt to misuse a photoshopped Aadhaar card. The release advised the people not to share photocopies of their Aadhaar with any organization because they can be misused. Alternatively, a masked Aadhaar which displays only the last 4 digits of Aadhaar number, can be used.
