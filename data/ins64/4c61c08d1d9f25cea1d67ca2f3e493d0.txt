2:07 AM ETGLENDALE, Ariz. -- Both Arizona Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury and quarterback Kyler Murray downplayed a heated exchange that cameras caught in the second quarter Thursday night following their 42-34 win over the New Orleans Saints that snapped an eight-game home losing streak.Cameras showed Murray walking to the sideline, repeatedly mouthing "Calm the f--- down" to Kingsbury with 2:32 left in the second quarter after Arizona called a timeout to reset its next play."The clock was running down and we couldn't have got off the play that we were trying to run," Murray said.
