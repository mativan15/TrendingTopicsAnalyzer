Judi Love is calling on King Charles to 'save the nation' and call a general election. The Loose Women panel reacted to yesterday's dramatic day of British politics on today's show, with Judi, Charlene White, Frankie Bridge and Nadiya Sawalha all offering their thoughts on Prime Minister Liz Truss ' recent resignation outside 10 Downing Street. Former EastEnders actress Nadia kicked off today's discussion about the government, admitting the country is 'still in a state of shock' following the latest Tory saga and slammed Truss for not offering 'a hint' of an apology as she addressed the nation and stepped down from her position after just 44 days in the role.
