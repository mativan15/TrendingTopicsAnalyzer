REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. – Republicans in President Biden's home state of Delaware held their convention on Saturday, sensing a renewed opportunity for electoral success in November as Democrats face trouble across the country and Biden's approval ratings sag.Delaware Republicans held their state convention at the Rehoboth Convention Center, where Biden himself had spoken a day earlier in the same room to address May's jobs report. He was still at his residence in the city when the convention was taking place, and Republican delegates and candidates took the opportunity to march by the convention center, and later toward the beach itself, chanting "Lets Go Brandon" — an anti-Biden slogan — and waving flags and banners.
