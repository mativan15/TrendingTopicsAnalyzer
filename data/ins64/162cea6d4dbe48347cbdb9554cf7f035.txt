Tamil Nadu BJP president K. Annamalai on Saturday said Chennai was likely to get flooded again during this year's monsoon as the DMK government had failed to even complete basic preparatory work towards mitigation. He said there were differing views from the elected representatives of the government on the status of completion of the storm-water drain works. Pointing out that it has been 1.5 years since the DMK government came to power, he said the government cannot continue to blame the inefficiencies of the previous AIADMK government for the present issues.
