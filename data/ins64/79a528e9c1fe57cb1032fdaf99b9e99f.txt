OXON HILL, Md. — The 2022 Scripps National Spelling Bee ended in a way none of the 93 competitions before it did. A spell-off. The final two competitors, Vikram Raju and Harini Logan, could not decipher any of their spelling attempts between Round 13 and 18. The bell rang 10 consecutive times. At that point, judges opted to institute the first spell-off – 90 seconds to spell as many words as possible correctly. The winner would win the Bee.Logan – an eighth-grader from Texas – spelled 21 words correctly, compared to Raju's 15, to become the 2022 champion.
