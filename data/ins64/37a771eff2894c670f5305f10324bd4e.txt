By Australian Associated Press Published: 00:36 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 00:36 EDT, 20 October 2022 Australia's biggest state has more than 70,000 homeless people, with older women the most at risk of not finding a roof over their heads, a NSW parliamentary report has found. "It is increasingly older people, particularly older women, who are the 'face' of homelessness of NSW today," the report 'Homelessness amongst older people aged over 55 in NSW' said. "This cohort may not sleep on the streets but may find themselves couch surfing among family and friends or sleeping in their cars, living in highly precarious situations".
