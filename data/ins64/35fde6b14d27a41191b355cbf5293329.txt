Food has been, and always should be, a relatively inelastic product. It's hard to imagine a scenario where DoorDash's core business is eradicated due to macro or industry-wide issues. Restaurants and grocers should continue to expand indefinitely, albeit slowly. While most people associate DoorDash solely as an industry-leading food delivery service provider, I believe it has the potential to become a multi-sector, on-demand delivery juggernaut.
