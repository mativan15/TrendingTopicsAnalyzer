There's a fair bit of excitement in Grant Dermody's voice at the moment as he embarks on life as an Invercargill city councillor. On Thursday night, alongside his fellow elected members, Dermody was officially sworn in as a councillor at a ceremony at the Civic Theatre. Dermody isn't simply a new councillor, he has been handed one of the more important jobs around the council table through to 2025. New mayor Nobby Clark has entrusted Dermody with the role of finance committee chairperson. The former Southland rugby representative comes from a finance background, which included time in the banking sector where he was part of the SBS Bank executive team.
