US stocks soared higher on Thursday, extending gains from Wednesday's relief rally as investors seek to end a seven-week losing streak in the S&P 500 and an eight-week losing streak in the Dow Jones.The move higher on Thursday came as investors continue to weigh the possibility of an economic recession against strong earnings results from retail companies like Dollar Tree, Dollar General, and Macy's which all soared more than 10% in Thursday trades after beating analyst estimates. The strong results relieved some fears investors had lingering from last week's earnings-related decline in Walmart and Target.
