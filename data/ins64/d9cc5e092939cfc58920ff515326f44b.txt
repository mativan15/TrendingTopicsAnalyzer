Over the past few days, Twitter users and certain news outlets have falsely claimed that the European Union has frozen the pandemic recovery funds for Spain.

It seems to have started when Bloomberg published an article explaining that Spain missed a second deadline last month to implement a new auditing system required to unlock money from the EU's pandemic fund, "putting at risk new payments from the €160 billion it's eligible to receive."

EU pandemic recovery funds are disbursed on a "performance-based nature," according to the European Commission.
