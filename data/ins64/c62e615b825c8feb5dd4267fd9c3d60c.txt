Speaking from his car seat, Ye joined Cuomo for a chat that spiraled quickly after the rapper went on to complain about the Jewish community and how an attempt was made to block him from earning money.He called out the "Jewish underground mafia media" for narrowing down his identity to just a "rapper" whereas he would have much preferred if they'd addressed him with other titles including "billionaire" and "businessman," Washington Examiner reported.
