Liz Truss is no longer the British Prime Minister, resigning just 44 days into her tenure — per USA TODAY, she's 'the shortest-serving leader in British political history.'
It's pretty wild, especially with all the jokes about how a head of lettuce outlasted her (we explained all that for you). And another meme has sprouted out of her resignation: Comparing the Liz Truss era to those of very short times athletes spent with certain teams.
Mike Piazza with the Marlins? Cole Beasley's very quick couple of games with the Buccaneers? Yep, there's a lot of that going around Twitter on Thursday.
