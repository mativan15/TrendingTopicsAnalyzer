West Ham defender Kurt Zouma, 27, has been ordered to complete 180 hours of community service by a UK court after he pleaded guilty to kicking and slapping his pet cat in a case which appalled fans and animal rights charities alike.The former Chelsea player admitted two offences related to the UK's Animal Welfare Act in a hearing at the Thames Magistrates' Court last month after a video was shared online by his brother Yoan, who plays for a lower league English club, showing the footballer abusing the defenseless animal.
