No winners in blame game, Oct. 10

On behalf of a great number of retired people, I wish to express thanks for all of the entertainment and excitement the Blue Jays have provided us this year. While baseball is a young man's game, it is a community connection for those who are not young.

With more limited opportunities to engage in regular community activities, many seniors follow a baseball team. Listening to broadcasters on an almost daily basis for six months of the year establishes, although one sided, a friendship for them.
