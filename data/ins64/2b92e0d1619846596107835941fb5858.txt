Gautam Adani, Asia's richest person, is in exploratory talks for a giant renewables project in Morocco, which would aim to supply electricity and emissions-free fuel to Europe. Adani's coal-to-ports conglomerate is considering building wind and solar generation plants in the North African nation and facilities to produce green hydrogen for export, according to people familiar with the proposals and who requested anonymity to discuss private details. The project, which would be Adani's largest clean power development outside India, could be as large as 10 gigawatts, according to one of the people.
