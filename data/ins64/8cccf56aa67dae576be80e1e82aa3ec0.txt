Online dating specialist Bumble (BMBL 1.05%) has been a publicly traded company for over a year now, but it has not performed particularly well. Some of Bumble's struggles in the stock market are probably attributable to macro-economic issues beyond its control.
Still, Bumble faces company-specific headwinds although there are also good reasons to consider the stock. If the tech company can stage a comeback, those who get in on its stock today will be rewarded down the line. But does Bumble have what it takes to turn things around?
