Rory McIlroy has questioned the quality of the field at the LIV Golf Invitational's opening event, saying it is ‘nothing to jump up and down about'.
On Wednesday, it was announced that the likes of Dustin Johnson, Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter have all signed up to play in a 42-man field at the Centurion Club in Hertfordshire next week.
LIV Golf's inaugural tournament, which takes place from 9-11 June, is set to boast a purse of nearly £20million, with £3m on offer for the winner, making it the richest prize in golf.
