Philadelphia apparel brand AnaOno, which creates bras and other garments for those undergoing or recovering from breast cancer and related treatments, has raised $1 million in a seed round to further its reach.

With the fresh funding – the company raised over $600,000 in a pre-seed round in 2018 and was bootstrapped prior to that – the Brewerytown business is looking to double its year-over-year sales and quadruple revenue. The seed round was led by New York venture capital firm Golden Seeds.
