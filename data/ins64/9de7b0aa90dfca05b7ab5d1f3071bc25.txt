Northern Irish paratriathlon star Oliver Gunning says a game-changing partnership between Boost Drinks and SportsAid has been instrumental in fuelling his globetrotting adventures this season.

The 18-year-old, who is currently ranked 21st in the B3 classification world rankings, started receiving support from Boost Drinks at the beginning of 2022 and has enjoyed a whirlwind of a year since then.

He represented Northern Ireland at the Commonwealth Games and has competed abroad in Spain, Portugal and Italy - something he admits would not have been possible without the all-important support.
