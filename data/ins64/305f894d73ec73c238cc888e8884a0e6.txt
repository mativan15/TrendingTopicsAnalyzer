Built on the GR86 Premium grade, the 2023 GR86 Special Edition will leave an unforgettable visual impression with its Solar Shift orange paint color, which is exclusive to this model. A GR cat-back performance exhaust system with stainless steel pipes, black chrome tips and debossed GR logo ensures that the GR86 Special Edition will leave a deep, growling auditory signature in its wake.

GR matte-black 18-inch wheels with black center caps and black lug nuts with Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires, a black GR C-pillar graphic and Ultrasuede/leather trimmed interior with GR special edition badge accent the striking color.
