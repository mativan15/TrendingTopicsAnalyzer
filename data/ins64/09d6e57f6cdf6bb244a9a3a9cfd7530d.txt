Former Texas Longhorns defensive back and now Minnesota Viking Kris Boyd is making a coordinated effort to support the victims of the tragic Uvalde shooting that took place at Robb Elementary on Thursday afternoon.
Boyd launched a GoFundMe with the goal to raise upwards of $150,000 for those impacted by the catastrophe.
I pray we can come together and show our condolences, love, and support in any way. We pray for change as a nation and have to start by taking action as one! We must protect our youth at all cost.
