Oct. 20—ORWELL — Village council passed six resolutions and one ordinance on Tuesday afternoon during a busy regular meeting at village hall.

Council voted to transfer $100,000 from the sewer bond fund to reduce the principle on a 40-year set of two loans that were originally $800,000.

Council discussed the matter during a recent work session and decided it was the best use of the funds that recently became available, instead of spending the money on something else.

Money was also approved to pay for a $6,000 project to move a diesel tank at the Orwell Street Department, add a gasoline tank, to be used to fill all of the village's vehicles, build a fence and purchase security cameras.
