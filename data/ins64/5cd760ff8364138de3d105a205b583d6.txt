A plane with 22 people on board has disappeared while flying in the Nepal mountains on Sunday, an offiical said.

The Tara Airlines plane was flying on a popular tourist route before it vanished without a trace.

Cloudy weather has prevented search helicopters from taking to the sky in the area of the flight's last known location, officials said.

'One search helicopter returned to Jomsom due to bad weather without locating the plane,' the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said in a statement.
