Fumio Kishida has ordered an investigation into the church, despite initial reluctance

Japan's prime minister has ordered an inquiry into the Unification Church, a religious group that has come under the spotlight after the assassination of former leader Shinzo Abe.

The man accused of killing him said the church had bankrupted his mother and blamed Abe for allegedly promoting it.

Scrutiny of the religious sect in the weeks following then revealed it had ties with many government lawmakers.

The scandal forced leader Fumio Kishida to apologise for those links.
