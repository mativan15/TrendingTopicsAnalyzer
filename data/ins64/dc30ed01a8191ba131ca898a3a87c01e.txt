LONDON — Her tenure as Britain's prime minister began in the early days of fall, but it didn't even last until winter.After her flagship economic policy sent the markets into a tailspin and was then almost entirely scrapped, Liz Truss was forced out by members of her Conservative Party on Thursday. 'Reality and the Conservative Party have not been best mates from 2015 onwards. They have a long record of ignoring economic forecasts,' said Anand Menon, director of the U.K. in a Changing Europe think tank, based in London.
