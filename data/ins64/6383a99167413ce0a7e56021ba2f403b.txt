SANTA CLARA — The 49ers are averaging 20.3 points per game. Even in the most lean years under coach Kyle Shanahan, the 49ers never finished a season having this much difficulty finding the end zone.
And here come the Kansas City Chiefs Sunday at Levi's Stadium, still rolling with quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce under the tutelage of coach Andy Reid, leading the NFL at 29.8 points per game.
It's a far less productive 49ers' offense than the one that faced the Chiefs in Super Bowl LIV, one that led the league at 29.
