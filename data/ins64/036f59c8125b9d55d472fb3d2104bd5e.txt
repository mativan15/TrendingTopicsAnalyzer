After three years of saber-rattling about passing major tech legislation for the first time since the dawn of the internet, Democrats in Congress appear likely to only have one shot at actually passing a law, and critics doubt the effort will succeed.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is committed to a vote on a high-profile anti-monopoly bill from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., as early as this month, according to sources in the House and Senate. It appears to be the only bill out of several proposed that has a chance to make it to the floor before Congress breaks for a summer recess and turns its attention to campaigning for the midterm elections.
