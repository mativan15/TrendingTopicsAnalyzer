England hooker Jamie George insists senior players must be consulted as rugby chiefs look to restructure the game in the wake of the financial crisis gripping the Gallagher Premiership.

Wasps followed Worcester into administration on Monday when all 167 players and staff at the club were made redundant and they are expected to join the Warriors in being relegated to the Championship.

Other teams are thought to be in similarly precarious positions and officials from the Rugby Football Union and Premiership Rugby will face a parliamentary committee next month to answer questions about the league's troubled finances.
