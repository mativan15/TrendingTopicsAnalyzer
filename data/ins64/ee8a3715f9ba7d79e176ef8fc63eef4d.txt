BRIGHTON, England — Nottingham Forest collected a hard-fought point from a 0-0 draw at Brighton to climb off the bottom of the Premier League on Tuesday.Brighton dominated the game at the Amex Stadium but again lacked a cutting edge, coming closest when Leandro Trossard struck a powerful shot against the crossbar in the first half.That's now four games without a win for Brighton since Roberto De Zerbi took charge of the team as the replacement for Graham Potter at the end of September. It hasn't scored in the last three games.
