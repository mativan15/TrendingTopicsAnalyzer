South_agency Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) is one of the world's largest alcoholic beverage companies by market capitalization. The company owns a diverse group of brands, allowing it to appeal to different consumer subsets. The company operates across the globe, with significant exposure to regions such as North America, South America, Europe, and South Africa. Despite Anheuser-Busch's illustrious operational setup, we believe the company is starting to lag behind the broader sectors' growth and doesn't provide full value to its investors.
