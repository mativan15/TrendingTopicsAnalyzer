The Labour Party is looking to capitalise on the Government crisis with a series of scathing new adverts as it gears up for the next general election.In four scathing posters, seen by the PA news agency, Labour attacks the Conservatives for damaging the UK's standing on the world stage, hiking mortgages and crashing the economy.It comes after a disastrous week for Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose authority has been left severely damaged by her decision to sack Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and reversing her prior decision to halt the increase on corporation tax.
