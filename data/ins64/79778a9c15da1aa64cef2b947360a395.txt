If you buy and hold a stock for many years, you'd hope to be making a profit. But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But RPM International Inc. (NYSE:RPM) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 57% over five years, which is below the market return. Unfortunately the share price is down 7.9% in the last year.

With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
