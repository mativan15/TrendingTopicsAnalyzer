Dwayne Johnson was brought to tears during an appearance on The One Show alongside comedian Rob Delaney.Catastrophe star Delaney had recalled a time after the death of his two-year-old son, when The Rock reached out to offer support.Delaney's son passed away in January 2018, having undergone two years of treatment for a brain tumour.Appearing alongside Johnson and Noah Centineo on The One Show, Delaney said: 'We hadn't [worked together] at this point but yeah he sent me a lovely tweet after Henry died which he didn't have to do, you know?'And that was very sweet and made me feel great, and then a couple of years later we did Hobbs and Shaw.
