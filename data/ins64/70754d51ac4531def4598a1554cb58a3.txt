Published: 03:36 EDT, 3 June 2022 | Updated: 03:37 EDT, 3 June 2022 Nick Kyrgios has poured cold water on a potential boxing bout with arch rival Bernard Tomic, insisting he has 'bigger fish to fry' than taking on the 'dead broke' World No 417.The Australian tennis duo have been embroiled in a war of words for years and their feud escalated even further last month after Kyrgios labelled Tomic 'the most hated athlete in Australia'. Tomic, 29, responded by challenging Kyrgios, 27, to a one-off battle on the grass court, with each player stumping up $1million in a winner-takes-all clash.
