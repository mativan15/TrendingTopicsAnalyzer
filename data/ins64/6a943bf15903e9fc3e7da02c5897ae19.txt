Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation earlier today, after only 44 days in office.
Which is exactly the same number of days David Blaine lasted in that box above the Thames.
Announcing her resignation, it seems Liz has managed to break a few records, the most prominent being the shortest serving PM (as well as the only PM to be beaten by a lettuce).
Her stint also managed to be shorter than a singular series of Love Island, as host Iain Stirling pointed out, shorter than Kim Kardashian's notoriously short-lived marriage to Kris Humphries, and even – would you believe it – shorter than Jedward lasted in the live shows of The X Factor.
