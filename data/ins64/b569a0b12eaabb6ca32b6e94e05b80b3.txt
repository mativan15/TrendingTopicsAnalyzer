At the start of the pandemic, Toronto mother of two, Eva Lannon, traded the hustle and bustle of big city life for a calmer lifestyle in Port Hope, Ont.
'Looking at our lifestyle it was very clear to us that it wasn't sustainable in terms of, you know, like other families running around, getting stuck on the Gardiner … it was grinding us down,' recalled Lannon.The move has also helped Lannon live a healthier life. Upon turning 40, she learned from her family doctor during a routine physical that she had developed hypertension, which is blood pressure that is considered higher than normal.
