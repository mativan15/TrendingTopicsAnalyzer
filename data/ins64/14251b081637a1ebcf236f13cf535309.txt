Yes, Sony's boosting PS5 production. It needs to. But during its investor briefing yesterday, the company also revealed it's expanding its efforts to bring major PlayStation IPs to TVs in a non-interactive form. While a The Last of Us series is already on its way to HBO, Sony revealed planning is underway for a show based on the Horizon games, coming to Netflix. Spreading the goodness around, Sony's planning a God of War series for Amazon Prime Video, too. Less interesting, at least as a concept, there will also be a Gran Turismo show in the works.
