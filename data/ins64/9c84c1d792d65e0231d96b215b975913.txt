When Warren Buffett, the CEO of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.28%)(BRK.B 1.25%), buys or sells a stock, Wall Street and investors tend to pay close attention. That's because Buffett has had a knack for running circles around the broader market since he became CEO back in 1965.
Since taking the reins, Buffett has created close to $670 billion in value for his shareholders (which includes himself), and he's led his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) to an almost unfathomable 20.1% average annual return.
