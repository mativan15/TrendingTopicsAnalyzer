There isn't a team willing to do more to work around the salary cap than the New Orleans Saints. They often stretch the limits of what's possible within the NFL's collective bargaining agreement through creative (and often unorthodox) contract structures and restructures, maximizing their resources to field the most competitive team possible year in and year out. It's what got them from being in the red by more than $70 million to cruising towards training camp with about $10 million to spend, having landed big free agent additions like Tyrann Mathieu and Jarvis Landry along the way.
