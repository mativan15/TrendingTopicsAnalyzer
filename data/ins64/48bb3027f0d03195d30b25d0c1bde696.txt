Harley-Davidson is letting employees work from home on what may become a permanent basis. Harley's Milwaukee headquarters closed in 2020 due to the global pandemic, but Harley CEO Jochen Zeitz says the complex is going to be repurposed rather than reopened for workers, according to Bloomberg.



Harley-Davidson continues to surprise with forward-thinking changes. First, the motorcycle company embraced EV motorcycles, spinning off the LiveWire brand to reportedly prevent its EVs from being overshadowed by legacy models.
