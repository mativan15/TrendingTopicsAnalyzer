NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices opened on a muted note on Thursday morning as strong manufacturing data in the US overnight pushed bond yields higher and raised fresh fears of Fed rate hikes. There were also concerns over the rise in Covid cases in Asia including that in Hong Kong and Mumbai. A buying in heavyweight and select IT stocks though ensured the market stays in the black. At 9.25 am, the BSE Sensex was trading 25 points or 0.05 per cent higher at 55,406.89. Nifty50 was trading flat at 16,522.
