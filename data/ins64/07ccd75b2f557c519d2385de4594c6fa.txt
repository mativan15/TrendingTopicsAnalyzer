Among the interviewees in Untold: Inside the Shein Machine (All4) is Fern Davey, an independent underwear designer from Bournemouth, who hand-stitches her pieces using sustainable materials. In 2020, the Chinese 'fast fashion' brand Shein started selling a lingerie set that looked identical to one of Davey's designs, with one clear difference: instead of costing £65, the imitation was £4. (Shein subsequently removed it from sale when Davey drew attention to the similarity.)Fast fashion has done away with seasonal collections and high-street store displays, replacing them with websites offering styles that piggyback on social media trends and are sold in short bursts, until the next thing catches the crowd's eye online and the brand starts flogging that instead.
