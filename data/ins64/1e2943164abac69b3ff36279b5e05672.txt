Barbara Kingsolver has been writing about issues of social justice for decades, starting with her first novel, 1988's The Bean Trees, set against the backdrop of immigrant life in Arizona. It's easy to dismiss her novels as middlebrow, but I've found the best of her work angry, engaged with politics, and alive to the natural world in ways that have only felt more relevant as tastes in fiction have evolved. Kingsolver's new novel, Demon Copperhead, takes her back to Appalachia, where the author was raised and where, after decades away, she once again lives, on a farm in southwestern Virginia.
