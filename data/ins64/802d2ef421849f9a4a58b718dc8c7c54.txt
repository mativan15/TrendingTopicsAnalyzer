Vicky Bakery is synonymous with croquetas, pastelitos and Cuban bread in Miami — but it didn't start out that way.

This year, Vicky celebrates 50 years in business. On the Oct. 20 episode of La Ventanita, the Miami Herald food podcast, we'll talk to Pedro Cao, whose father, Antonio, immigrated from Cuba, bought a small bakery in east Hialeah, kept the name and turned it into arguably the most famous Cuban bakery in South Florida.

Full disclosure: My mom was raised with the Cao family, dating back to the tiny country town of Cárdenas, Cuba, so I grew up with every birthday cake for the first decade of my life from Vicky.
