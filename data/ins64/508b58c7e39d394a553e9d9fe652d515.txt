A mime working at SeaWorld went viral when he called out a dad for appearing to neglect his hardworking wife — but some TikTokers feel the dad isn't getting a fair shake.

The footage, recorded by a SeaWorld guest by the name of Ernest while vacationing in Orlando, Fla., gained over 13 million views, 2 million likes, and 24,000 comments.

We've seen dads' seemingly bad behavior go viral before — like the father-to-be who was less than thrilled to discover his third baby was a little girl — but rarely is a mime the true star of the footage.
