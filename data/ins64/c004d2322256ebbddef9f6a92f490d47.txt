The junk talking at 'The Match' included some friendly fire prior to its start.

Josh Allen is teamed up with Patrick Mahomes. They're facing Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers.

But during a pre-match presser, Mahomes slung a bit of a knock at Allen.

Referencing the infamous Bills-Chiefs postseason game now known as '13 seconds,' Mahomes named what he thinks Allen's biggest fear is.

A coin toss.

Even Allen had to shake his head… especially since Mahomes went on to toss Bills fans into the gesture as well.
