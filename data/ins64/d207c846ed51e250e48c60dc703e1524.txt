TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Prior to his resignation earlier this week, the campaign manager for Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist was arrested in Maryland after he and the mother of his child each filed domestic abuse-related charges against each other.

Austin John Durrer, a 43-year-old who worked as chief of staff in Crist's congressional office before joining the campaign, was arrested Tuesday at his Cambridge, Md., home. The arrest was first reported by NBC News. Authorities arrested only Durrer but he later pressed charges against the child's mother, Jackie Whisman, according to court records.
