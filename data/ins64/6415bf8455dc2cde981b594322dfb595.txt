Apple's 33rd edition of the annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is set to commence on June 6. Like every year before the conference, there are rumours about what the company has to offer. This time, a report by MacRumors suggests that Apple has created a package of trading cards that you can view in augmented reality, rising the speculation that the company might introduce NFTs in the future.
Memojis have been a common feature of Apple's marketing strategy for years. However, this year Apple decided to add an augmented reality (AR) element twist to it.
