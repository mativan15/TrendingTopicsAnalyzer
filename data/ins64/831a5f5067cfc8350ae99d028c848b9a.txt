The Indian women's team is set to host World Champions Australia for a five-match T20I series in December later this year. The dates and the venue of the series, which was announced by Cricket Australia on Monday as part of its men's and women's schedule for the season, remain unconfirmed.

The Indian women's team, which last appeared in the ODI World Cup in March, will next compete at the Commonwealth Games in in July before taking on hosts England in a white-ball series comprising three ODIs and as many T20Is in September.
