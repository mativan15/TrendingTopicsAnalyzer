Abbott Nutrition said it plans to build a new $500 million facility for specialty and metabolic infant formulas, amid calls from advocates and experts that there needs to be more domestic manufacturing and diversity in the supply chain.

The company in an earnings call said it also made leadership changes at its Sturgis, Michigan baby formula manufacturing plant as well as in its quality organization, following a shutdown and nationwide recall that exacerbated formula shortages nationwide.

'We're moving forward with plans for a half-billion-dollar investment in a new US nutrition facility for specialty and metabolic infant formulas,' company chairman and CEO Robert Ford said on an earnings call with investors Wednesday.
