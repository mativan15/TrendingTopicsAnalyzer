Sales of homes fell 1.5% in September, the eighth straight month of decline, as higher mortgage rates and still elevated prices preyed on the market, the National Association of Realtors reported on Thursday.

At an annual rate of 4.71 million, slightly better than the forecast of 4.69 million, sales are now 23.8% below a year ago and down from 4.8 million in August.

'The housing sector continues to undergo an adjustment due to the continuous rise in interest rates, which eclipsed 6% for 30-year fixed mortgages in September and are now approaching 7%,' said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun.
