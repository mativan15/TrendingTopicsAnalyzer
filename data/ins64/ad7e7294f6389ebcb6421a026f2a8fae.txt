Statistically speaking, long term investing is a profitable endeavour. But unfortunately, some companies simply don't succeed. To wit, the Medical Developments International Limited (ASX:MVP) share price managed to fall 53% over five long years. That's an unpleasant experience for long term holders. And some of the more recent buyers are probably worried, too, with the stock falling 48% in the last year. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 35% in the last 90 days.
