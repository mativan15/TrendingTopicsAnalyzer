Oct. 20—The Schuylkill County District Attorney's Office has applied for a $189,441 two-year grant that would be used to help investigate gun crimes in the county.

"Since I've been in office in 2018, I've seen seen a marked increase in crimes committed with guns," District Attorney Michael A. O'Pake said Wednesday. "There are people that are possessing guns that have felonies on their records that prohibit them from possessing a gun.

"There are people who are possessing guns without proper licenses, and the violent natures of crimes committed with guns is very concerning to me.
