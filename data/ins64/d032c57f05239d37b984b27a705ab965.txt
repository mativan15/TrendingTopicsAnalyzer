Rob Delaney has told of the agony of losing his two-year-old son Henry, describing it as ‘the heaviest pain in the world'.
The American comedian, best known for creating and starring in Channel 4's Catastrophe alongside Sharon Horgan, and his wife Leah lost their son in January 2018. 
Henry was diagnosed with a brain tumour just after his first birthday. Following surgery to remove the tumour, the cancer later returned, leading to his death. 
Since then, Delaney, 45, has spoken of Henry in numerous interviews.
