From The Times, October 20, 1922:The coalition is broken. The Prime Minister has resigned office. Mr Bonar Law has been asked by the King to form a ministry and is understood to be reserving his reply pending the selection of a new leader by the Unionist party. Should the party, as is highly probable, elect Mr Bonar Law to be its leader, he may on well-defined conditions, accept both the Unionist leadership and the task of forming a new Government. In that event an early dissolution of Parliament would be likely.
