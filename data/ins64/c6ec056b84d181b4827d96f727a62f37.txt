Here's some good news. Alontae Taylor was a full participant at Tuesday's New Orleans Saints practice session, signaling that the team has opened the three-week window for Alontae Taylor to return to practice. It's a big development: the rookie cornerback was lost to injured reserve back on Sept. 24, but could return in time to reinforce a secondary that hasn't met expectations in recent weeks. Taylor suffered an MCL strain in practice that made it hard to run with an injured knee, but he's now practicing with his teammates and working to get back on the field on game days.
