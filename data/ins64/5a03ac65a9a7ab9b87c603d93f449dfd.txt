Jack Nicklaus again insisted on Tuesday that he wants nothing to do with the Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf Invitational Series.

Nicklaus told The Fire Pit Collective earlier this month that he was offered more than $100 million to run the LIV Golf Invitational Series, something he said he turned down repeatedly. Hall of Famer Greg Norman instead took the job, though it's unclear how much he is being paid.

Nicklaus confirmed that those meetings took place on Tuesday, and said he took those meetings because he's been working on building a course in that country in recent years.
