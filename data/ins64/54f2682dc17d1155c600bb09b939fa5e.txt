May 27—Only once have I covered a story of mass murder by a gunman and left it with a sense of hope. Then I learned hope is more fragile than bone china.

I was working at a newspaper in Pittsburgh when a chilling crime occurred a few hours away in the bucolic region of Pennsylvania known as Amish Country.

A 32-year-old gunman, married with two daughters, murdered and wounded girls in an Amish school. Why girls were his target remains unknown.

He armed himself with a pistol, a shotgun, a rifle, a stun gun and 600 rounds of ammunition.
