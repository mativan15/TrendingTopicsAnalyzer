The Nasdaq led the charge with a 3% advance, as the S&P 500 broke its seven-week-long weekly losing streak. Tech stocks were among the drivers of Friday's rally, including a surge in Dell (NYSE:DELL). The stock posted a double-digit percentage gain on strong quarterly results. Meanwhile, United Therapeutics (UTHR) extended its recent gains to set a new 52-week high.
