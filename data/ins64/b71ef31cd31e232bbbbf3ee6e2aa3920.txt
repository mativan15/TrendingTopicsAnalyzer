CNN — Pete Couste said it was his wife who first noticed that he was turning up the TV louder than she liked."I couldn't hear the words in movies as much anymore," admitted Couste, who lives just outside Washington, DC.Watching TV isn't Couste's only problem. In his church choir, he can't always hear his part and get the pitch right. It's also affected his work at the Fire Safety Research Institute, a nonprofit that generates safety research. The 61-year-old said he feels less effective judging audio quality when his team makes their life-saving videos for firefighters.
