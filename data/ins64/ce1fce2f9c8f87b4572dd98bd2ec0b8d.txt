Add another player to the ever-growing list of injured defensive backs for the Los Angeles Rams. Sean McVay said on Monday night that Grant Haley suffered a Grade 2 ACL sprain in Sunday's win over the Panthers and will miss the next 4-6 weeks.

McVay said he's likely a candidate to be placed on injured reserve, which would force him to miss at least four games.

'Grant Haley got a Grade 2 ACL sprain, probably four to six weeks and he's a likely candidate for IR,' McVay said.

The Rams have a bye in Week 7 so if Haley is placed on injured reserve, he would need to miss the four games after the bye.
