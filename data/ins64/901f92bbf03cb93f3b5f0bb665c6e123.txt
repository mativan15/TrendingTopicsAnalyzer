Snap Inc. stock lost nearly a third of its value in one day after the social media company posted disappointing third-quarter results late Thursday.

Snap (NYSE: SNAP) shares plummeted 32% to a 52-week low of $7.33 a share Friday morning before ending the day at $7.76 a share, down 28% from Thursday's closing price.

The Santa Monica, California-based company released third-quarter results after the close of New York markets Thursday showing a wider loss than a year ago and a slower-than-expected revenue growth.
