The Queen was well-known for her love of horses while she was alive but the new King will be breaking with a royal tradition that dates back decades.
Charles is set to sell off all of the best-performing racehorses he inherited from the Queen in a ‘scaling back' from royal tradition.
The 12 treasured racehorses will now be sold off at Newmarket's Tattersalls auction house.
One of the horses which will be sold includes Just Fine – who was trained by Sir Michael Stoute – and was the first horse to win for the new King.
