Amanda Holden knows how to make an impression with her Britain's Got Talent attire… and tonight, she pulled out all the stops to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee.
As the judge made her entrance on the stage with Simon Cowell, David Walliams and Alesha Dixon, she was revealed to be wearing a spectacular Union Jack gown that definitely gives Ginger Spice a run for her money.
To complete her look, Amanda, 51, donned a tiara fit for royalty, with the top half of her ensemble bearing some resemblance to Wonder Woman's costume.
