Jeremy Hunt's Budget is set to be delayed by the Prime Minister due to the tight three-day turnaround between a new leader and the economic announcement, according to reports.

The Chancellor has been working on plans to tackle Britain's financial crisis after ripping up Liz Truss's mini-Budget hours after entering No 11.

The Budget was set to be announced on Oct 31, but now the new Tory leadership contest is scheduled to come to an end on Oct 28.
