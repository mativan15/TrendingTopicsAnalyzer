For a good deal of the last 18 months, investors yawned at our cautiousness and reluctance to chase stocks higher. For almost every stock that we wrote about, we had a buy under price that was well under the current price. In the case of Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC), that perfect entry was under $17.00 back when we covered it in June 2021. Interestingly, the stock's 52-week low was well under that, at $16.
