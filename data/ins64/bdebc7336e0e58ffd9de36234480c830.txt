In that article, entitled "Is LUMN's 10% Yield Too Good To Be True?", we cautioned investors about the risk of LUMN's then ~10% dividend yield. Indeed, shortly after that article, concerns regarding Lumen's dividend safety have been raised by leading institutions too. For example, a Wells Fargo's analysis pointed out its dividend risk, citing its free cash (in the $800M range) as insufficient to cover the dividends (more than $1B) in the coming years.
