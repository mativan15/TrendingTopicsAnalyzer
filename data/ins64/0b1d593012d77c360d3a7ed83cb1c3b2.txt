Bills to extend mayoral control of New York City schools by two years and lower class sizes in city schools passed the New York state senate Thursday, despite a last-ditch effort from Mayor Adams' administration to get state legislators to reconsider.One of the bills — which still needed approval from the state assembly and Gov. Hochul as of Thursday afternoon — will extend Adams' authority over city schools for two years, and beef up a watchdog panel responsible for overseeing the city Education Department.
