Wikipedia—the online encyclopedia that helps you learn stuff, waste time, and seem more knowledgable than you really are—is not immune to foreign propaganda, according to new research. A study published Monday exposed a network of shadowy editors, the likes of which have been attempting to sway the narrative about the Russo-Ukrainian war by making changes to the website's articles. The study doesn't definitively point the finger at the Russian government but still finds plenty to be worried about when it comes to 'suspicious edits' made on the open-source platform.
