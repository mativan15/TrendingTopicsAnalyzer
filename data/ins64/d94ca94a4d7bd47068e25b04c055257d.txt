Strange female forms peer from the walls of the Serpentine South, a gallery in London. Surrounded by distorted bodies and smudged faces, the viewer has the unnerving impression of being inside a house of mirrors. Yet these paintings by Kamala Ibrahim Ishag, a Sudanese artist, are more than reflections. They are tributes to the lives of women whose inner turmoil and struggles are writ large in Ms Ishag's enthralling work, created mostly in Sudan over the course of seven decades. The paintings in 'States of Oneness', her first solo exhibition in Britain, reimagine the women who have buttressed Sudan's ongoing fight for democracy.
