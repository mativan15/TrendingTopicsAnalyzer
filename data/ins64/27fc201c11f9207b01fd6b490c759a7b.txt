I am trying to disprove the claim that the Republican leadership plan to slash Social Security if they win the midterm elections.Plenty of opinion polls say the GOP are on track to win control of the House of Representatives in the elections in less than two weeks. They may also win control of the Senate. That would make Congressional leader Kevin McCarthy the next Speaker of the House of Representatives, with sweeping control of the legislative agenda. A few days ago McCarthy caused a storm with some comments about federal spending and the debt ceiling limit, in an interview with Punchbowl News.
