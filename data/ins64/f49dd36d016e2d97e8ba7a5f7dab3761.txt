Oct. 20—People who come to Greensburg on Sunday to create their own candles will at the same time be shining a light on the fight against breast cancer.

In conjunction with Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the recently opened Wicks & Wax Studio is hosting a Pour For Pink event that will raise money for the nonprofit Pennsylvania Breast Cancer Coalition. It runs from noon to 6 p.m.

"We wanted to do some kind of fundraising event, and we decided to go with Pour For Pink and make a donation to the coalition," said Hannah Toski-Thompson.
