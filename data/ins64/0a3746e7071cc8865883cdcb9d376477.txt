Pros Excellent sound quality Very comfy fit Two sets of ear cushions Solid call quality Outstanding battery life Great app support Cons No ANC or ambient mode No EQ in app Volume levels low in wired mode Planar magnetic headphones aren't new, but due to the technology's relatively high price and relatively large size, it's been relegated to the upper echelon of the headphone market, where those with enough money to afford them (and an audiophile sensibility to appreciate them) have been the only buyers.
