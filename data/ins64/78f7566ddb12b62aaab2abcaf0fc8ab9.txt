A six-year legal battle between Centennial Bank and ServisFirst Bank over Centennial's botched acquisition of Bay Cities Bank and alleged misconduct by Bay Cities Bank CEO Gregory Bryant has reached a conclusion.

Alabama-based ServisFirst is paying Arkansas-based Centennial $15 million to settle claims in a lawsuit filed in the Middle District of Florida by Centennial. Centennial alleged that Bryant, who resigned three months after its acquisition of Bay Cities to join ServisFirst, poached customers and key banking executives.
