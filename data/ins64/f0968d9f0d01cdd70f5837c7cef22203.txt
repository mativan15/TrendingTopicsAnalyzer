A silk panel commissioned to hang in Westminster Abbey for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953 has sold for four times its estimate.

The panel is to stay in the United Kingdom after a fierce bidding war with a potential buyer from the United States.

The silk panel was due to fetch 400 to 600 pounds ($500 to $750) but eventually went for 2,000 pounds ($2,500) — or 2,600 pounds ($3,200) with buyer's premium.

The special silk was hung alongside other historical panels, setting the scene for the special ceremony and can be seen in many historic photographs of the coronation.
