Panthers interim head coach sent receiver Robbie Anderson to the locker room during the second half of Sunday's loss to the Rams for a non-injury-related reason.

Wilks did not elaborate much in his postgame press conference, telling reporters in Los Angeles that it was a 'sideline-type situation.'

'I felt like I wanted to try to get him in at the moment. And that's something that we'll discuss as we further get into the week,' Wilks said.
