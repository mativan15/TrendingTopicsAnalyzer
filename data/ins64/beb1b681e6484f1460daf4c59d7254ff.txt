Liz Truss resigned in dramatic fashion on Thursday, marking a new record for a UK government falling apart.A viral video from the night before she went helps explain why. It shows the longtime Conservative MP Charles Walker tearing apart Truss and her supporters, whom he blamed for trashing the party's reputation.The clip, which was shared on Twitter by BBC reporter Dan Johnson, shows Walker speaking to BBC News in the lobby of the House of Commons shortly after a chaotic vote on natural-gas extraction.
