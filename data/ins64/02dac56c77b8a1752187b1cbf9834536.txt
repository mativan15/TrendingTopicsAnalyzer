When Matt Rogers was growing up, he had a lot of holidays on Fire Island. They were very heterosexual. Raised in nearby Long Island, the comedian and actor saw the area as a standard holiday resort, the kind of place you'd go with your family. 'JWoww from Jersey Shore was a bartender there, you know what I mean?' he tells me. But Rogers knew this wasn't the whole story. He was aware of Fire Island Pines and Cherry Grove – little pockets of the resort that had been a queer Mecca for decades. 'I was always a little afraid of them and nervous about them,' Rogers says.
