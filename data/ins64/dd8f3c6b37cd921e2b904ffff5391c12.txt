Netflix Inc reversed customer losses and provided a slightly more bullish outlook than Wall Street expected, projecting a new ad-supported streaming option would help attract 4.5 million subscribers by year's end.
Shares of Netflix jumped nearly 14 percent in after-hours trading. The company's stock, an investor favourite during its years of rapid growth, had fallen nearly 60 percent this year before the earnings report.
From July through September, Netflix attracted 2.4 million new subscribers worldwide, more than double the 1.
