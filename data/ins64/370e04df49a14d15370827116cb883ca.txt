There are two types of gods in this world. The singular god of monotheists and the many gods of polytheists. The one god of monotheists demands obedience to the law he communicates through messengers. The many gods of polytheists offer all sorts of help, and solve all sorts of problems, provided they are given something in exchange.
Monotheists tell the story of how their one god once asked his messenger to sacrifice his son, but observing his unconditional obedience, stopped the human sacrifice at the last minute and replaced the human victim with a sheep.
