WWE and AEW veteran William Regal has urged wrestlers to stop risking an ‘early grave' by striving to be seen as the best in the world.
The 54-year-old British legend – who is highly regarded as one of the greatest of all time – has urged people to focus on more than just the in-ring side of the business to avoid getting caught in a trap, and he's something he's seen plenty of wrestlers fall victim to.
He exclusively told Metro.co.uk: ‘It's not a knock on anybody trying to be the best wrestler in the world, I just don't want them to eat their lives up, fixate on it.
