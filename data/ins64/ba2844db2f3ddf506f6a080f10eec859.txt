Credit card rates have hit a record high amid soaring inflation which has driven shoppers to borrow to cover living costs.
The average annual percentage rate – or "APR" – charge on credit cards has reached 26.6pc this month, the highest since records began in 2006, according to Moneyfacts, a financial analyst.
May's average rate represented a jump of 0.4 percentage points compared to February, when the average rate was 26.2pc, and surpassed the previous high of 26.4pc set in October 2021.
Richard Lane of StepChange, a debt charity, said the number of people turning to credit cards is rising as inflation has surged.
