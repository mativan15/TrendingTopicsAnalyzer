Nvidia (NVDA -0.83%) reported record sales from data centers during Q1 (the three months ended May 1, 2022). In fact, as AI becomes more useful and affordable, it's no longer the realm of high tech. Industries across the entire economy are putting AI to work, and Nvidia is emerging as the top platform for the movement. As a result, data centers are likely to remain the company's top revenue source going forward. 
This transformation of Nvidia's business means there could be many more years of rapid growth ahead.
