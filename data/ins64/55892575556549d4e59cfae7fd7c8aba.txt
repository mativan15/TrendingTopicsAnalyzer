The FBI has 'significant, impactful and voluminous evidence' of 'potential criminal conduct' by first son Hunter Biden and first brother James Biden in connection with their business dealings in China and Ukraine, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) charged in a letter to top law enforcement officials last week.
Grassley's Oct. 13 missive to Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray, and Delaware US Attorney David Weiss was obtained by the Washington Examiner Monday and accused the bureau of a 'pattern and practice of political decisions,' citing FBI whistleblower allegations.
