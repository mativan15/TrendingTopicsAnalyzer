Let's start with some bad news: Amazon is discontinuing Cloud Cam support this year. The company launched the proprietary security camera system in 2017, but after only five years on the market, is closing down shop for good. The good news is you won't be left without a security camera option, since Amazon is offering affected customers a Blink Mini for free.As reported by MacRumors, Amazon is ending support for Cloud Cam products and apps on Dec. 2, 2022. When they say 'ending support,' they mean it, too: once the deadline hits, your cameras and their apps stop working, and all data will be deleted, including all of your saved recordings.
