Twitter investors sued both Elon Musk and Twitter itself in a California court on Wednesday, arguing that the SpaceX and Tesla billionaire drove the social media company's price down before initiating a buyout, and then publicly disparaged Twitter in a bid to renegotiate the terms of the purchase.The class-action suit was brought by investor William Heresniak 'on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,' which would include small investors like Herseniak all the way up to financial giants like the Vanguard Group and BlackRock, which own a combined 15% of the social media platform.
