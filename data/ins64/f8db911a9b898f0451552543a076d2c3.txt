WhatsApp's most popular messaging app is set to launch its iPad version, making it easy for iPad users to use the app. As of June 2021, India was the leading country globally in terms of WhatsApp users. About 487 million WhatsApp users in India made WhatsApp the go-to messaging app for many. However, iPad users were always at a disadvantage when it came to using WhatsApp. The application is not supported on iPad, so users had to choose alternate messaging apps to connect with their loved ones. While users can download other messaging apps on the iPad, they can't download WhatsApp.
