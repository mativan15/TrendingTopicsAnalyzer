A young gay mental health counselor was found dead in April in the early morning hours and his bank accounts depleted days later. Now, family and friends are asking how this could have happened.

Julio Ramirez, 25, met a friend in Hell's Kitchen on April 20, according to NBC News.

They eventually made their way to the gay establishment the Ritz Bar and Lounge. A security camera near the bar caught Ramirez with three men, Ramirez's brother Carlos told the outlet. He said the men then entered a taxi.
