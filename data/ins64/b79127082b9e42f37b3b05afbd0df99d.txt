A group of sophisticated scammers has ruined the lives of two more Australians after stealing $150,000 and $80,000 from their latest two victims.

Including those most recent losses, the fraudsters have stolen at least $2.73 million that news.com.au knows of from eight Australian victims. The highest individual loss totalled $750,000 and even an accountant in his 40s fell for the con.

The cyber criminals have been operating two different schemes in Australia since at least February and now victims are speaking out in an attempt to warn others.
