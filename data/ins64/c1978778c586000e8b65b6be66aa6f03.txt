Liz Truss, the departing British prime minister, is eligible for a taxpayer-funded allowance capped at 115,000 pounds ($129,000) a year for the rest of her life.
Despite her short time in office, Truss became eligible Thursday for what's called the Public Duty Costs Allowance — a government reimbursement plan for staff and salary costs incurred by former prime ministers 'arising from their special position in public life' after they leave office, according to the government's website.
This has drawn scorn, however, from some of Truss' political opponents, who have called for her to be refused the payment because of what they see as her role in Britain's political and economic turmoil.
