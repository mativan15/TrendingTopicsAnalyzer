Nadine Macaluso started her career as a model to support herself before she met her ex-husband.

While married to Jordan Belfort, Macaluso gave up modeling and started a maternity company.

After leaving Belfort, Macaluso found her path to therapy through meditation and earned her Ph.D.

More than 20 years after ending her marriage to Jordan Belfort, famously known as the "Wolf of Wall Street," Nadine Macaluso is a family therapist and somatic psychologist using the experiences in her marriage to help others leave abusive relationships.
