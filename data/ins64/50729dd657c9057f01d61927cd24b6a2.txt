Amazon says over half a dozen hardware vendors have indicated that they cannot enter into a TV manufacturing relationship with the e-commerce group over fear of retaliation from Google.
The revelation, officially shared for the first time by Amazon, was made by an Amazon India unit to the country's antitrust watchdog as part of a years-long investigation into Google over claims that it abuses the dominant position in Android. The watchdog found that Google did abuse its dominant position in Android and slapped a $162 million fine on Thursday.
