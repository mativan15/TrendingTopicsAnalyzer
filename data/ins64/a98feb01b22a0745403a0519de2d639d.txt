The original 1995 off-Broadway production of 'Songs for a New World' ran for just 31⁄2 weeks and was met with a Variety review that called the show 'more cabaret convention and piano bar posing than any one revue should have to withstand.'

Nevertheless, Jason Robert Brown's first produced show persisted as a favorite for colleges and local theaters, despite its vocally demanding score. Sunnyvale Community Players (SCP) are taking it on in a production that opens Oct.
