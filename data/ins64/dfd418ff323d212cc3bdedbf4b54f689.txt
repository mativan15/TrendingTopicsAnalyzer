ABSTRACT breaks down mind-bending scientific research, future tech, new discoveries, and major breakthroughs.

Plastic is everywhere. According to the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Laboratory (NREL), in the United States, only 5 percent of plastic used is actually recycled. This is in large because plastics are not all chemically the same, making it harder and more expensive to separate individual polymers. These mixed plastics often build up in landfills and in the environment.

Now, a new study published in Science on Thursday details a new process that could allow us to recycle these plastics that typically end up as waste that will take hundreds of years to degrade.
