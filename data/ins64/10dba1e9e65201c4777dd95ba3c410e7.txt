When Oscar winner Redmayne sat down in his first production meeting for 'The Good Nurse,' his daughter had just been born. His daughter is 6 now as the feature is finally seeing its Netflix debut on Oct. 26.

'It's been a passion project, and it's been one of those projects that each step of the way has been massively enjoyable, despite the intensity of the subject matter,' Redmayne says. The feature, directed by Tobias Lindholm, is inspired by the true crimes of nurse Charlie Cullen who was investigated by nurse Amy Loughren, played by Jessica Chastain.
