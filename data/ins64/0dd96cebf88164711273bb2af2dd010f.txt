Tyler Wright's first job out of college paid far below the national average wage of $53,000. "My starting salary was $30,000, with not really a promise of a dollar more unless you perform," he told Insider of his commission-based job in Florida. He was working as a recruiter for a company that did healthcare staffing. Wright realized pretty quickly that he didn't want to work a 9-to-5 job forever. He wasn't entirely sure what he wanted to do instead, but started reading personal finance books to learn everything he possibly could about money — how to earn more, invest effectively, and build wealth.
