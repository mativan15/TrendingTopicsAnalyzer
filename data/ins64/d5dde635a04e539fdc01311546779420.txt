Rising inflation and interest rates are hurting the financial health of Canadians and eroding their satisfaction with Canadian banks, a report by J.D. Power shows.

The survey of 14,013 banking customers by the consumer research firm looked at customer satisfaction of Canada's large and mid-size retail banks.

It found 'a noticeable decline' in the number of customers who felt they were financially healthy, dropping to 38 per cent in July-August from 50 per cent in January-March.

The worsening financial health was most prominent among bank customers age 40 and older, according to the report.
