Here at Planet Money, there's a feeling we get about twice a week. A story has wrapped up...all the loose ends are tied...all the stones are turned over...the T's are crossed and the I's are dotted. And then...it's like a curiosity hangover. We wonder if we'll ever find anything interesting again. Fortunately, we have a simple solution: the Planet Money mailbox. We love to hear from curious listeners, and, once in a blue moon, we send our reporters out into the world to track down answers to your important questions.
