Doctor Who star Jodie Whittaker has opened up on how Yaz (Mandip Gill) and the Doctor's story will end ahead of her emotional regeneration.
Showrunner Chris Chibnall has promised a ‘tear-filled goodbye' to Jodie in the upcoming special The Power of the Doctor and we can only imagine that Yaz, who finally confronted her feelings for the Doctor in recent specials, will be no small part of it.
Asked about how the show will see out Yaz and the Doctor's story, Jodie told Metro.co.uk: ‘I think that what Chris has done really brilliantly, in [Legend of the Sea Devils] and then going forward, is there's so much action and there's such an epic storyline and a roller coaster of events.
