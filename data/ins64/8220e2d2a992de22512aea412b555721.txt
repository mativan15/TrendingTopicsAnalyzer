Fermentation refers to the action of microbes, or invisible tiny bacteria, yeast, and fungi —microorganisms, and the action of those on food. It sounds scary, until you realize that three-quarters of our favorite foods are fermented, like wine, beer, and yogurt.

Any kind of cheese or yogurt or sour cream or anything like that is fermented.
