Meghan Markle unwinds in style!
 
In a video that accompanied her Variety Power of Women cover, out Wednesday, the Duchess of Sussex talked about the entertainment she and her family turn to for amusement.
 
"Hi, I'm Meghan, and I play a mean game of Scrabble!" she began. "Especially timed Scrabble. It's something that I've loved for a long time. I'm very good at Jeopardy!" she added with a laugh, mentioning that she loves to cook and makes "a really solid Bolognese sauce."
 
The camera cut to behind the scenes of her Variety photoshoot, shot at San Ysidro Ranch in her town of Montecito, California, before panning back to the interview.
