With four months to go before she faces Chicago voters, Mayor Lori Lightfoot still hasn't secured an overwhelming financial advantage over rival candidates seeking to make her a one-termer at City Hall.

But with few exceptions, Lightfoot's declared opponents haven't been able to bring in big hauls either, leaving the race wide open for financial movement.
