With new Covid-19 sub-variants being reported from across the world, the Kerala government on Monday said it is intensifying preventive measures in the state. Health minister Veena George said the new genetic variants - XBB and XBB1 - are 'more contagious than the earlier ones".



She further urged people, especially the elderly and those suffering from comorbidities, to be more careful, reported news agency PTI.
'Since the elderly and those with co-morbidities are more likely to be severely affected by the new Covid variants, they, as well as healthcare workers must take the booster/ precautionary dose of the vaccine,' George said.
