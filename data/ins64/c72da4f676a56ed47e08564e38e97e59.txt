Ford head Jim Farley said the brand's electric vehicles may shift to fixed prices and completely online sales. In a speech today at an IBM conference, Farley described a future where Ford dealerships would no longer stock inventory but serve as customer service centers for picking up online orders or repairing existing vehicles — with buyers also having the option for home delivery.  In this hypothetical scheme, eliminating car dealerships would put an end to haggling with salespeople.
'We got to go to non-negotiated price," said Farley.
