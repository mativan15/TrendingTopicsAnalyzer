OTTAWA — Canada said on Monday that it is introducing some of the toughest gun-control measures in decades, including a ban on the purchase, sale and transfer of handguns, in response to concerns about violent crime. Canada will compel owners of banned semiautomatic firearms to sell their weapons to the government, starting at the end of this year. The proposed bill, introduced in Canada's Parliament, would allow courts to order gun owners to surrender their weapons should a judge believe they pose a danger to themselves or others, and allow authorities to take away firearms licenses for those involved in acts of domestic violence and stalking.
