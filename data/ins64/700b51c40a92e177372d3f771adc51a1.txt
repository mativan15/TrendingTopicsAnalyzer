Young women workers are closing the wage gap with their male counterparts, according to a recent study.

In 22 U.S. metropolitan areas, women under 30 who worked full-time and year-round earned as much or more than men of the same age, according to a Pew Research study that analyzed 2015-2019 Census American Community Survey data.

Two big reasons why? Women are getting college degrees at greater rates than men and are employed in professions that pay more.

'As the education gap gets bigger between men and women, the wage gap gets smaller,' said Pew Research senior researcher and study author Richard Fry.
