I am having a nightmare with British Gas. It is double-billing me for my flat, and I can't get it to listen.For the past year I've had a British Gas account in my name and pay my bills by direct debit every month. However, the company is also sending another set of bills to 'the occupier'.We are in the middle of an energy crisis and British Gas is asking me to pay twice.I have called and contacted it via live chat and been told the problem is going to be sorted out but six months on nothing has happened.
