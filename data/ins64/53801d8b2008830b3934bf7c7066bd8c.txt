Meghan Markle has sat down for her first magazine interview since the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Speaking to Variety, the Duchess of Sussex opened up about how she and her husband Prince Harry are mourning the loss of the monarch, who Meghan deemed a 'shining example' of female leadership. Queen Elizabeth's death came just over a week after the Duchess spoke to The Cut, an offshoot of New York Magazine, for an interview that attracted a huge amount of controversy due to her comments about the Royal Family.
