A series of Conservative MPs have called for Liz Truss to step down following a day of almost unparalleled political chaos, which has left dozens of other Tories unsure about whether they even hold the party whip after rebelling in a Commons vote.Three more MPs joined the ranks of those saying publicly that the prime minister should step down: Henry Smith, the Crawley MP; Gary Streeter, who represents South West Devon; and Sheryll Murray, MP for Southeast Cornwall.The total number of such MPs still remains below about a dozen, but many more believe the same in private, adding to the pressure on Truss.
