It was just a few months ago that I wrote about the legacy of Left 4 Dead and its many descendants that have emerged over the years. These "horde shooters," as I call them, are so numerous that it's hard to get an accurate headcount, but one of the teams doing the best work in that space has long been Fatshark. First with the two games in the Warhammer Vermintide series, and now with the forthcoming Warhammer 40K spin-off, Darktide, it's been fun to watch how this team has reimagined and sometimes improved on the core of such games created by Left 4 Dead nearly 15 years ago.
