The Denver Broncos (2-4) are set to host the New York Jets (4-2) at Empower Field at Mile High in Week 7. Here's our quick game preview for the AFC showdown.
Broncos' keys to victory: Jets QB Zach Wilson is off to a slow after returning from injury with one touchdown pass, two interceptions and five sacks through his last three games. The second-year QB will be making just his 17th career start in the NFL and Denver's defense will aim to pressure him into mistakes. Broncos OLB Baron Browning has looked excellent filling in for injured OLB Randy Gregory and he'll face a shaky New York line this week.
