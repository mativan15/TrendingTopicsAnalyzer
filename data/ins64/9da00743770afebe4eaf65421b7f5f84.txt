ROME, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's pro-Russia statements are likely to complicate Giorgia Meloni's efforts to establish international credibility for the government she is set to lead, analysts say.Berlusconi is a long-time friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin and this week reiterated his sympathy for him, accusing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of triggering the war.Berlusconi's views on the war and affection for Putin are especially sensitive given that a senior member of his Forza Italia party, Antonio Tajani, is widely expected to become foreign minister in a government led by Giorgia Meloni.
