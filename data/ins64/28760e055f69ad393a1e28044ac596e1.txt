A recent video from the Securities and Exchange Commission warning against investing in 'memestocks' was not well received by retail traders who pride themselves on such gambles. The video, part of a series called "Investomania," features contestants on a game show where a Jeopardy!-like board features options including: celebrity endorsements, fomo (fear of missing out), tulip bulbs, guaranteed returns, crypto to the moon, and meme stocks. The tone is purposefully bizarre and absurd: Contestant A chooses meme stocks to invest in, hits a button, watches his money drop down a trapdoor, and gets hit in the face with a pie.
