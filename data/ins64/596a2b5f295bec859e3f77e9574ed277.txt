May 28—Don't let those dollar signs with all those zeros attached fool you, Eddie Campbell Jr. said.

Campbell is superintendent of Monongalia County Schools, and his district just approved an operating budget of $145 million for the 2022-23 fiscal year.

That ledger, however, isn't entirely in the black, he said.

The district is projected to lose some $1.9 million in state aid dollars due to the 350 local students who have already enrolled in charter schools for fall, he said.

The state allocates around $4, 300 per student in that funding formula, and if a student goes out of the county system, those dollars go with him.
