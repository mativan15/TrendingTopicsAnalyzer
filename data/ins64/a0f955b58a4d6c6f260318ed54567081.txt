Lloyds Bank says there has been a 90 percent increase in so-called 'advanced fee' frauds in which scammers target loan applicants demanding money be paid upfront. On average, victims have lost around £231 each time the scam is used, suggesting the relatively small amount is being easily obtained by fraudsters, with little resistance or suspicion from victims.Criminals are contacting potential victims following an online application in which personal details are entered by loan applicants.According to Lloyds Bank, tricksters are convincingly posing as representatives of genuine loan companies, and have even sent victims copies of paperwork in the post to back up their scam.
