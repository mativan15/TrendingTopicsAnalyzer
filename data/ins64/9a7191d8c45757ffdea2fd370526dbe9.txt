LAGOS (Reuters) - Nnamdi Nwaogu, a 44-year-old IT worker, has packed his bags. In Lagos, Nigeria's frenetic commercial capital, galloping inflation and a plunging naira have pummeled his salary.

Nwaogu, like hundreds of other Nigerians, left amid a brain drain that is punishing even for a nation used to losing its young and educated.

"We have serious doubts if this is the time for that hope to blossom," he said before flying to the UK last month.

Nwaogu began a master's degree in England, while his wife, a doctor, will join him in January with their three children.
