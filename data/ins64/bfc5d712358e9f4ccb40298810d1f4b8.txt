Neebing, Ont. — Municipality of Neebing (Blake Township) councillor candidate Gary Shchepanik could do something that hasn't been done in almost 50 years.

Should he beat out opposing councillor candidates Ron Woit and Katherine Hill for the Blake job, Shchepanik would be the first Neebing politician to hold office for both the municipality and the City of Thunder Bay's Neebing ward during his career since former Municipality of Neebing Reeve Mario Tocheri was appointed to the City of Thunder Bay council in 1975.
