aluxum The stock market is rallying for the second-straight session Tuesday, with the S&P (SP500) (NYSEARCA:SPY), Nasdaq 100 (NDX) (QQQ) and Dow (INDU) (DIA) gaining more than 1%. Investors should keep a watch on S&P 3,700 into the close, according to Citi. It has traded above that for most of the session, having bounced after a breach lower in midday. "About a fifth of short positions are already in loss at 3,650, with more than half ($17bn notional) in the red if the market moves above 3,700," Citi global head of quant strategy Chris Montagu and team wrote in a note.
