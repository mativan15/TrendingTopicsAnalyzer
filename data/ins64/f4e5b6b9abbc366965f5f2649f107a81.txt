Shares of Roblox Corp. soared by nearly 20% after it posted September user numbers that may indicate a turnaround at the youth-oriented social video gaming company.

After posting numbers this year that appeared to indicate youngsters were finding other things to do as the pandemic lifted, the San Mateo company on Monday posted these numbers for September:

Daily active users rose 23% year over year to 57.8 million.
Hours engaged by those users rose 16% to 4 billion.
Bookings were estimated up by between 11% and 15%, to between $212 million and $219 million.
