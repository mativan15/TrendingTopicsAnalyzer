Zimbabwe's central bank is revising its inflation forecast upward after annual price-growth surged to more than 100% this month.Factors including shortages of everything from corn to cooking oil stoked by the war in Ukraine, rising fuel prices and domestic exchange-rate volatility are reasons to adjust the outlook, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor John Mangudya said in a phone interview on Monday. The bank said at the start of 2022 it expects inflation of 25% to 35% by year-end.'We are doing a recalibration of the numbers,' he said.
