TEMPLEGATE goes in search of some winners from Monday's racing - as the build up to Royal Ascot continues.
Read on for our man's top tips.

ARABESCATO (8.30 Pontefract, nap)
He made his turf comeback with a close-up second at Nottingham last month. The 1m6f trip looked on the sharp side there and he'll be much happier at this longer distance. FIFTYSHADESARESDEV (9.00 Pontefract, nb)
Went down in a tight finish in a stronger race than this at York 16 days ago. He found seven furlongs a bit sharp there and will be happier up at this mile.
