Market Wagon, an Indianapolis-based online farmers marketplace, has given food producers a new outlet since it recently expanded into Chicago.

Market Wagon, which was founded in 2016 and opened in Chicago in February 2021, aims to enable food producers to thrive in their local markets with its direct-to-consumer business model.

It now operates local food delivery hubs across the Midwest, including one in Chicago that offers delivery services to residents in Cook County and neighboring counties.
