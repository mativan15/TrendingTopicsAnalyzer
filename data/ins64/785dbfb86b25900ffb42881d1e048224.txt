The country faces a stern test of trust in democracy as the Conservative party sets about finding a new leader after the resignation of Liz Truss.
Ms Truss's departure from No10 leaves behind faith in politics that is said to be ‘toxic' at a time when ‘government is needed more than ever'.
Her calamitous 44 days in office were set by the ill-fated mini-Budget after which she sacked her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng as her tenure fell apart. 
As Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson are linked to the latest Tory leadership race, the issue of the public's faith in democracy has come to the fore.
