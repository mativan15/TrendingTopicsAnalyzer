SAN JOSE — The stage is set for two of the Bay Area's biggest events to meet in a head-to-head clash. 
El Niño, say hello to Super Bowl 50.
In less than two weeks, hundreds of thousands of visitors will come to the Bay Area for the Feb. 7 NFL championship game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara. The game will culminate nine days of special events throughout the Bay Area, including the free, outdoor festival Super Bowl City in San Francisco, which is expected to attract 1 million visitors.
Unfortunately for the NFL, Super Bowl 50 is arriving in the midst of one of the most powerful El Niño winters on record, conditions that have delivered a series of storms this month, with more expected through April.
