FANWOOD, NJ — A long-standing staple in Fanwood, Scotchwood Florist, is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a customer appreciation day on Saturday, Oct. 22. The South Avenue shop, owned and operated by Lori and Dale Flowers (no pun intended), first opened in 1972 after Lori's family, the DeMilts, purchased the former Crowder's Home Ranch, which was a home and garden center. The flower business had a boom in popularity during the 70s and 80s when Florists' Transworld Delivery was just a wire service and flower shop owners did all business in person and over the phone, according to Fanwood Public Information Officer TomToday, online flower sales are huge and, in the case of Scotchwood, helped save their business during COVID.
