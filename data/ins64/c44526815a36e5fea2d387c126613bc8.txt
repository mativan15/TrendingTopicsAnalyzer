Today is the final day of Memorial Day weekend, which means that many of the major sales are coming to an end as well. Best Buy still has some great offers available on big-ticket items like major appliances, TVs, laptops and more, but you better hurry if you're hoping to take advantage of these discounts. All these deals are set to expire at 9:59 p.m. PT (12:59 a.m. ET) tonight, so be sure to get your order in before then.With so many great deals and such little time, it can be difficult to know if you're getting a good bargain.
