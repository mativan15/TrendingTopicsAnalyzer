In a show that is currently tacking male rape and post natal depression, a balance is needed with some classic soap campness – and the war between EastEnders titans Linda Carter and Janine Butcher is providing just that. 
Kellie Bright and Charlie Brooks have been able to perfect their scowls and smirks and deliver barbed quips and insults to one another and it's been glorious to watch.
We approve of Janine having a more human dimension but, admit it, we all love her at her bitchy best. 
Linda has been holding her own against her nemesis though and the feud is proper EastEnders.
