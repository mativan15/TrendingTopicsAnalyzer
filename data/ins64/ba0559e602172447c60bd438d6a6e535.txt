Confirmed to be returning to its usual summer slot in July, Amazon Prime Day is fast approaching – and with it, thousands of deals across tech, gaming, clothing, beauty, alcohol, fitness, TVs and plenty more.Starting out in 2015 as a celebration of Amazon's 20th anniversary, the now annual event has since become one of the biggest shopping events of the year, second only to Black Friday.While the 48-hour sale's deals on big-ticket items such as laptops, home appliances and mattresses often score the headlines, you'll find equally stellar savings in fashion – an area that is not to be dismissed.
