The Odisha government has made the tamper-proof high-security registration plates (HSRPs) mandatory for all classes of old vehicles that were registered before April 2019. The HSRP on old vehicles will be affixed by vehicle manufacturers through their authorised dealers only to control and check the substandard material, the State Transport Authority (STA) said on Monday. The deadline for affixing HSRP for vehicles carrying Odisha registration mark and registration number ending with 1 and 2 is August 31, according to a release.
