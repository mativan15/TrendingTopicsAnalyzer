Travellers should get automatic reimbursement for cancelled foreign holidays like the delay repay scheme for trains, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has said.Shapps ruled out sending in the armed forces to help process holidaymakers after scenes of travel chaos over the half-term break, saying it was up to airlines and airports themselves to hire and train more staff. He said there should be a campaign 'to attract people to the sector and make sure that people are properly paid'.The transport secretary said he wanted there to be a scheme for people to get quick refunds, like the national scheme train companies use to compensate passengers for delays.
