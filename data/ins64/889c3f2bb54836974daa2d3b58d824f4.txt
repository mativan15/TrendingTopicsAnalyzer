The Raiders drafted quarterback Derek Carr in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft, and he's been Las Vegas' signal-caller ever since, breaking franchise records along the way.
But as fans and followers of the Raiders know, Carr's tenure hasn't been as smooth as those facts would indicate.
Due to several regime changes and the Raiders' subpar win-loss record with Carr at the helm, rumors of a quarterback change for Las Vegas have persisted throughout Carr's tenure. That was definitely the case during the last Raiders regime led by ex-coach Jon Gruden, especially with Gruden's reputation as a QB guru, and one that likes mobile quarterbacks at that.
