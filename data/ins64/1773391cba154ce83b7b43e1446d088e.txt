Californians will finally get a chance to elect a senator after Kamala Harris gave up her seat in 2021 to become Vice President.
If it sounds like there's a familiar name already on the ballot, here's why: When Harris left office, Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed current Sen. Alex Padilla.
The U.S. Constitution's 17th Amendment specifies that appointees to the Senate should serve 'until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.' In May 2021, the California Legislature passed a law calling for the replacement vote to take place during the regularly scheduled election this November.
