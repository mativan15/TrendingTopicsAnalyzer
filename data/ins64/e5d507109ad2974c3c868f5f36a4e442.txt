WINNIPEG — The federal and Manitoba governments will contribute more than $33 million for the construction of a Métis National Heritage Centre in Winnipeg.

Northern Affairs Minister Dan Vandal, who is a Winnipeg MP, announced $23.1 million in federal funding Saturday during the Annual General Meeting of the Manitoba Métis Federation.

The money is on top of $5.1 million that Ottawa has already contributed to the project, and Premier Heather Stefanson told the Federation's AGM in a video statement that her government will be contributing $10 million.
