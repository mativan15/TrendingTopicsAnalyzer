RiverNorthPhotography Evercore ISI downgraded Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) to an In Line rating on Wednesday after having it set at Outperform. Analyst Greg Melich and team are cautious on AAP due to a reduced industry growth outlook and concerns that lingering share loss is likely to constrain AAP's upside. "We believe disinflation and a decelerating consumer will make comps more challenging into 2023. A slower environment is never easy on the turnaround player." The tough macro backdrop for 2023 is seen leading to lower returns for AAP lower returns as Street numbers slip and EBIT margin goals are tougher to hit.
