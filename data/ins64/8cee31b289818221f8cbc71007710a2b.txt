This year will undoubtedly be a strong one for Pfizer (PFE -1.85%). The COVID-19 vaccine maker is going to get a huge boost in sales this year, which management expects to come in the neighborhood of $100 billion. More than half of that will come from sales of its COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) and pill (Paxlovid), which together will contribute approximately $54 billion.
Despite the implied 23% revenue growth, the stock's performance has been underwhelming. Shares of Pfizer are down 9% year-to-date, which is only slightly better than the S&P 500's slide of 13% during that time.
