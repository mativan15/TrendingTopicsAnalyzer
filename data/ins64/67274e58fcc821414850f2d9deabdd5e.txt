Doug Gottlieb: 'Second-half points per game the Eagles are [31st] in the NFL [5.8 points]. Some of that has to do with gameplay— they get a big lead in the second quarter and they can be super conservative, but some of it is when it's off-script it can be a little dicey for Philadelphia. I'm struggling to buy into a team that struggles so much to score in the second half. You're talking about five points per game in the fourth quarter at HOME. Granted, they've won all these games and you're playing with the lead and it allows your defense to pin their ears back and they can be conservative and not turn it over and that's why they're winning games as well, that's fine.
