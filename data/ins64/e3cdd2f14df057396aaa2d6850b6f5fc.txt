Mark RobertsonBy Mark RobertsonOct 19, 2022Halloween is just around the corner and those who celebrate are gearing up for the 31st with spooky decorations and buckets of candy for trick-or-treaters — although they may want to avoid one house on the block. A handwritten sign on a home's front door was posted on Reddit. The post is captioned "Karen doesn't like Halloween and thinks Jesus has candy." "We do not give away free candy to lazy entitled freeloaders. No handouts welcome to America. If you want candy, get a job and find Jesus," the sign continued.
