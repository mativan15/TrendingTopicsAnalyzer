Is the Conservative party a sinking ship? Events on Monday suggest so. The captain, Liz Truss, was missing from the deck for much of the afternoon. Her second in command had been thrown overboard last week after a disastrous mini-budget.

The policy now is to increase the pay of bankers and see household energy bills rise next April by 75% to an average of £4,400 a year.
