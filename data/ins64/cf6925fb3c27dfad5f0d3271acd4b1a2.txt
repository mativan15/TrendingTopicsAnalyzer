Next week is a critical week in the history of the Washington NFL franchise. The Virginia government will convene and hold a vote to determine if the state will give the NFL franchise $350 million in taxpayer dollars to help build a new stadium.
Senate member Chap Peterson, a former season ticket holder for the NFL franchise, says he will not vote in Washington's favor, despite being a strong proponent in the past. Peterson's logic is this is more like an expansion team with no ties to the region, not the Redskins.
