Australia is on the brink of an energy crisis, if it hasn't already started.Wholesale power prices are currently more than five times last year's average price, sparking fears that some electricity retailers will collapse.This calamity has been years in the making, but recent events have supercharged it.Its causes are many: the war in Ukraine; extended cold snaps during La Niña; a lack of domestic gas supply; unreliable coal-fired power plants; and years of delays in building a grid based on renewable energy and batteries.
