Klaus Vedfelt/DigitalVision via Getty Images I raise my investment rating for Choice Hotels International, Inc.'s (NYSE:NYSE:CHH) shares from a Hold to a Buy. I last wrote about CHH in an article published on October 11, 2021, where I analyzed the company's shareholder capital return priorities and the stock's valuations. After assessing the company's recent portfolio optimization activities and the growth of its extended-stay segment, I have decided to upgrade my rating for CHH. Choice Hotels International is optimizing the company's portfolio by retaining what it calls "revenue-intensive" hotels, and exiting those that are not performing within expectations.
