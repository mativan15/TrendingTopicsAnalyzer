The Golden State Warriors reached the 2022 NBA Finals with the highest payroll in basketball. The Boston Celtics barely crack the league's top 20 list of payrolls, though they have six of the 10 highest-paid players in the series.
The Warriors have the NBA Finals' three highest-paid players, including the superstar with the largest salary for the 2021-2022 season. Stephen Curry made more money than any other player, ranking just ahead of James Harden, John Wall and Russell Westbrook. Jayson Tatum, Boston's highest-paid player, earns a smaller salary than 34 other NBA players.
