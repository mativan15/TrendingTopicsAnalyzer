24K-Production Leading mREIT AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC), which has a sizeable portfolio of Agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) has seen its stock continue its downtrend bias since its highs in June 2021. Moreover, AGNC took a steeper dive from its July 2022 highs, falling nearly 43% to its October lows. As a result, AGNC is closing in on its March 2020 COVID lows as investors fled AGNC, given the unprecedented rate hikes by the Fed in battling record inflation rates. We believe the battering is justified, given the tremendous interest rate volatility, leading to the rapid widening of the MBS spreads.
