Bet_Noire/iStock via Getty Images The following segment was excerpted from this fund letter. 1847 Goedeker Inc (NYSE:GOED) We acquired an 8% position in the warrants of 1847 Goedeker Inc (GOED) at an average cost of $0.62 starting in late December 2021 and are continuously adding throughout 2022 to lower our price average. We are very excited about this investment and think the market has given us a fantastic multi bagger opportunity. Our investment in GOED, a high growth appliance e-commerce company, is very reminiscent of our investment in HireQuest (HQI) where a large, successful private company merged with a substantially smaller and underperforming but public competitor.
