The Dolphins elevated offensive tackles Brandon Shell and Kion Smith from the practice squad for Sunday's home game against the Minnesota Vikings.

The decision to bring up two linemen instead of one could signal that left tackle Terron Armstead, who has played through a lingering toe injury, may not be able to suit up Sunday.

Armstead left last week's loss to the New York Jets on the second possession after he reaggravated his toe injury, which he initially sustained in Week 1. He stayed in New York overnight to get further evaluation on the injury.
