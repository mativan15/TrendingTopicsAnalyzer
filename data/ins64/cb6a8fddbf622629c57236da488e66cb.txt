The second-year fullback is the only one of six Titans listed who was downgraded from Wednesday's report.

NASHVILLE – The Tennessee Titans might not have a full backfield Sunday when they face the Indianapolis Colts.

Fullback Tory Carter did not participate in practice Thursday because of a neck injury. That is a downgrade from Wednesday when he was a limited participant and makes him the only one of the six players listed by the Titans whose status changed from the week's first injury report.

The second-year pro has seen limited action on offense this season.
