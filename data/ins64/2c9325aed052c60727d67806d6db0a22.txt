Kyle Rittenhouse says Johnny Depp's victory over Amber Heard in court is "fueling" his drive to file his own defamation cases. Rittenhouse, who fatally shot two men and injured a third in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020, was acquitted in November 2021 of five charges, including first-degree homicide. Rittenhouse and his mother, Wendy Rittenhouse, have accused several parties — from President Joe Biden to media outlets and celebrities, of "defaming" him. In February, Rittenhouse hinted that he might sue media organizations, telling Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he was launching an initiative called The Media Accountability Project to fundraise money to sue politicians, celebrities, and athletes.
