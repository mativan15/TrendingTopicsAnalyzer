A man in China wants his former stepson to pay 35,200 yuan (approximately $5,285) for raising him after separating from his ex-wife last year.

The man, surnamed Tang, from Sichuan Province, filed a lawsuit against his ex-stepson, surnamed Liu, in March to recuperate money he spent supporting him during four years of college. Tang said the money includes university tuition as well as food and clothes.

Tang married Liu's mother in 2009 and helped raise him until September 2021 when she filed for a divorce.
