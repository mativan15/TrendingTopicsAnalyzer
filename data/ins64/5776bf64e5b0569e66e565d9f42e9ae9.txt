Uber has started offering electric vehicles to customers in certain parts of the Delhi-NCR region and says it will be expanding its efforts over the coming months. The electric cabs are currently only available for pre-scheduled trips.
'As the leading mobility app in India, we are committed to supporting the Indian government's emission goals. Expect to see more electric vehicles — be they two, three or four-wheeled — across Indian cities in the coming months,' the spokeswoman said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch in response to a query.
