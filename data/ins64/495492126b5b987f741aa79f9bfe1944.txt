Jun. 4—The Glynn County Commission unanimously approved funding Thursday for the engineering and preliminary design of a roundabout at the intersection of Sea Island and Frederica roads.

The vote ends the debate over adding more turn lanes or a roundabout as the solution to the traffic backups in the morning and afternoon rush hours.

Commissioner Cap Fendig, whose district encompasses all of St. Simons Island, said there is a perception that Twitty Park cannot be used for anything but a park. But according to County Attorney Aaron Mumford, the county-owned land can be used as a park, for right of way or both.
