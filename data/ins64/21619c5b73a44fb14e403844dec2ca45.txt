The nature of investing is that you win some, and you lose some. Unfortunately, shareholders of Similarweb Ltd. (NYSE:SMWB) have suffered share price declines over the last year. In that relatively short period, the share price has plunged 68%. Similarweb may have better days ahead, of course; we've only looked at a one year period. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 39% in the last three months.

With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
