CLEVELAND — The Cleveland Guardians got back to playing their unique brand of baseball in Game 2 of the American League Division Series. They made contact. Got some clutch hits late. Hustled themselves into big plays. And they pitched pretty much lights out.

It added up to a 4-2 extra-inning win over the Yankees to even the series 1-1 as it heads back to Cleveland for Game 3 tonight. Triston McKenzie gets the start for the Guardians a week after his strong start in the Wild Card-series clinching win over the Rays.
