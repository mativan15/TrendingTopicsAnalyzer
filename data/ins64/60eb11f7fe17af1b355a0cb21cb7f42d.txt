ATLANTA – Kyle Shanahan isn't getting sentimental, even if Sunday marks his first game in this town since winning the NFC Championship.
He was the 2016 Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator back then, before an ensuing Super Bowl heartbreaker, before the 49ers hired him as their coach, before the Falcons franchise underwent an overhaul.
'It's been a long time, and I've played against them a number of times, and it's always about the people,' Shanahan said Friday, before the 49ers left their week-long hostel at The Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia.
