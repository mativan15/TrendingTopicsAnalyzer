Oct. 16—JOHNSTOWN, Pa. — One corner of the Community Arts Center of Cambria County's front yard turned into a makeshift camp for carving Saturday.

And Avary Ratchford was in the middle of a pumpkin party.

"Look what I made," Ratchford, 8, said with pride as she paused to show off her jack-o'-lantern.

"They have so much kid-friendly activities here," said Vawni Ratchford of Windber, while her other daughter, 9-month-old Aniaiah, embraced the opportunity to reach for a tiny fistful of pumpkin guts.
