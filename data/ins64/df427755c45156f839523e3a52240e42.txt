Published: 04:04 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 04:04 EDT, 19 October 2022 Nottingham Forest manager Steve Cooper has '100 per cent' belief in his players as his new-look side continues to adapt to the demands of the Premier League. Lowly Forest picked up only a sixth point of a difficult season so far following promotion by grinding out a goalless draw at Brighton on Tuesday evening. The club remain winless since the second weekend of the campaign, with Cooper still attempting to strike a balance between attacking threat and defensive solidity, while bedding in 23 summer signings.
