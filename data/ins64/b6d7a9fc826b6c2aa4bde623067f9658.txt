Hours before the 68th annual covocation of the Gujarat Vidyapith, nine out of 24 trustees resigned citing 'unethical use of power' for the appointment of Governor Acharya Devvrat as Chancellor, stating that it was 'under crass political pressure' and appealed to the Governor to 'uphold de-mocratic values' by declining the offer.

In a joint statement, the nine trustees said that the appointment of Devvrat as the new Chancellor 'was rushed through, not by consensus but by a badly fractured vote', adding that 'Gandhi's philosophy cannot be reduced to mere natural farming, cattle breeding or nature cure', referring to the election of a non-Gandhian to the top post.
