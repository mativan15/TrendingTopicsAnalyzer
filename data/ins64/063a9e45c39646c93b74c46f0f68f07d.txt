ANILalu Prasad and Tejashwi YadavIn a setback for former railway minister Lalu Prasad, wife Rabri Devi, son and Bihar's deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav and other accused, the Delhi High Court has dismissed a petition seeking quashing of cognisance of CBI's charge sheet taken by a lower court in the IRCTC hotels case. The court ruled that "it would not be feasible to quash the proceedings at such an initial stage". Referring to the July 2018 cognisance order by a lower court, HC held that "while taking the cognisance" the lower court "was of the view that the sanction wasn't required, though not elaborated the same".
