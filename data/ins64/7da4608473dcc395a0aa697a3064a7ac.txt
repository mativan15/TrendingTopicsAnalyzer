EXTREME-PHOTOGRAPHER/E+ via Getty Images Earnings of BCB Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:BCBP) will most probably continue to surge this year on the back of economic factors. The economic growth in New York and New Jersey will boost the loan portfolio size, while the rising interest-rate environment will increase the margin. Further, the significant asset quality improvement in the first quarter of the year will keep provisioning subdued for 2022. Overall, I'm expecting BCB Bancorp to report earnings of $2.
