May 27—NORWICH — After two years of engineering and honing plans for the safety-minded reconstruction of Route 82 in Norwich — a major project the mayor says will displace or close several businesses — state transportation officials will present the updated plans and schedules to the public.

The City Council scheduled the public informational meeting for 7 p.m. June 23 in the Kelly Middle School auditorium. Plans for the proposed project include adding six roundabouts and a raised median divider, removing seven traffic lights and other changes from the area of Salem Plaza, 77 Salem Turnpike, to the intersection with Fairmount Street approaching downtown.
