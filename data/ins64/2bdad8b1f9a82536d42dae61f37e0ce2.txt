Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Wednesday took an apparent jibe at the Enforcement Directorate's (ED) summons to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and MP Rahul Gandhi for questioning in a money laundering case linked to the National Herald newspaper. Taking to Twitter, Chidambaram said that 'money-laundering without money is like alleging purse snatching without a purse.''It is like alleging that you were found unauthorisedly swimming in a pool that had no water,' he quipped. 'You can think of more examples (each one more absurd than the other)'The fresh summons to Gandhis triggered a war of words between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress, with the opposition party alleging that the BJP is using 'puppet agencies to intimidate political opponents'.
