Everyone loves watching a good fight. You and I both know it, and Street Fighter has proven that for decades – all while ensuring nobody actually gets hurt! Outside of accidentally smashing a thumb on an arcade stick, maybe.
During State of Play on Thursday, Capcom unleashed an extensive gameplay trailer for Street Fighter 6. No pre-rendered business this time; it's all in-engine tussles between the world warriors. The goofy-looking logo is gone too!
In the trailer, you can see familiar faces like Chun-Li and Ryu, along with some newbies we haven't met yet.
