Glenn Kelman on Thursday talked about the tenuous state of the real estate market, which is struggling as mortgage interest rates have soared faster than they have in the history of their being tracked.

Around $4.5 trillion of loans were issued last year, and it's expected that will drop to $1.7 trillion next, Kelman, CEO of Redfin Corp. (Nasdaq: RDFN), said in the keynote address at the annual dinner of the University of Washington's growing Runstad Department of Real Estate, which saw enrollment increase from 178 students last year to 332 this fall.
