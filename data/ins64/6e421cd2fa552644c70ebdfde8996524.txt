The UK government has reversed its decision to axe IR35 tax reforms — announced little more than three weeks ago — following a volatile market reaction to its planned tax cuts.
Among a package of tax cuts, the move to cancel IR35 tax reforms — controversial measures which mean fewer contractors can claim work outside employee status — was announced on September 23.
But today, Jeremy Hunt — who replaced Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor of the exchequer on Friday — announced he planned to reverse most of the tax cuts introduced in the so-called mini-budget, a humiliating U-turn for the government.
