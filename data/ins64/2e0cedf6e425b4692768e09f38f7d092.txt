ETtechIllustration: Rahul AwasthiBengaluru: Edtech startup Udayy has fired 100-120 employees and shut down after its business slowed following the reopening of schools offline. 'We had enough capital in our books, but the business no longer made sense in the offline world, customer acquisition cost became very expensive,' cofounder Saumya Yadav told ET. 'We had enough capital, but a post-pandemic lot of parents started asking for refunds, and kids did not have time as schools opened up.' 
Yadav said all employees including teachers have been paid severance amounts and almost everyone has been placed elsewhere.
