NOTE. — The value of this article, written by my husband in 1914, lies chiefly in the fact that it gives an idea of the pre-war, or what could justly be called the normal, industrial situation. Wherever it has been possible, the actual statistics have been brought up to date. Generally speaking, however, there have been no recent studies dealing with the processes of American industry, and recourse was had to the Census of Manufactures made in 1914, and just off the press, as the most modern statistics covering the field as a whole.
