A former top Guatemalan official was sentenced Monday to one year in prison after pleading guilty to paying hefty bribes to Guatemalan politicians through the U.S. banking system to gain support for telecommunications contracts that benefited a company where he had worked as an executive.

Acisclo Valladares Urruela, the former economics minister in Guatemala, admitted that he transferred $350,000 in bribery payments to the unidentified Guatemalan politicians through two companies with bank accounts in Miami, according to a factual statement filed with his plea agreement.
