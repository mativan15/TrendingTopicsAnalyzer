Chinatown-International District (CID) residents flocked to Hing Hay Park in Seattle on Saturday following the announcement that the planned homeless shelter expansion in the SODO neighborhood will no longer push through.

King County announced Friday that it will no longer expand a homeless shelter in Seattle's SODO neighborhood near the International District — composed of Chinatown, Little Saigon and Japantown — after pushback from residents and business owners.

The planned expansion, which proposed accommodations for an additional 150 people at Salvation Army's Lighthouse Shelter, faced heavy opposition from community members in the last several weeks.
