WANDA NARA was spotted kissing rapper L-Gante in a bowling alley and has now posted images of the pair cosying up on social media.
The 35-year-old, who recently split from Galatasaray striker Mauro Icardi last month, is more than a decade older than the 22-year-old musician - real name Elian Angel Valenzuela.

But the age difference has not stopped them from kissing and cuddling less than one month after her break-up with Icardi.
