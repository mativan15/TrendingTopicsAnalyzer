LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Britain's Liz Truss said on Wednesday she was a "fighter not a quitter" in a new attempt by the prime minister to reassert her authority over a restive party in which calls are growing for her to quit.Just days after her newly installed finance minister, Jeremy Hunt, ripped apart her economic programme that had sent shockwaves through markets, Truss was keen to show she was in charge, announcing a renewed commitment to raising pensions in line with inflation.But facing questions in parliament for the first time since Hunt scrapped most of her tax-cutting plan, Truss's words were met with laughter, boos and jeers, especially when she told the opposition Labour Party it needed to grasp economic reality.
