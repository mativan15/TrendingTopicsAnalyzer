The US financial watchdog has contacted Elon Musk about the disclosure of his stake in Twitter, asking the Tesla chief executive why he appeared to file a crucial form late.The Securities and Exchange Commission published a letter sent to the world's richest man in which it asks a series of questions about how he declared his acquisition of a 9.2% stake on 4 April. The move sparked a flurry of corporate activity that led to Twitter accepting a $44bn (£35bn) takeover bid from Musk on 25 April – although he has since announced that the deal is 'on hold' while he seeks more information about the proportion of fake accounts on Twitter.
