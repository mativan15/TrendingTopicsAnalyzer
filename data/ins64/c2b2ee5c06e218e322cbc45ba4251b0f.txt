Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA -6.9%) opened as one of the S&P 500's biggest laggards on Friday as staffing cuts and safety issues unsettled investors. In particular, another leaked email from Tesla (TSLA -6.9%) Technoking Elon Musk revealed potential plans to slash headcount while US regulators unveiled investigations into the company's much-ballyhooed autonomous driving technology. Shares of the Texas-based electric vehicle manufacturer fell over 6% on the open, leading the Nasdaq to drop sharply as well.
