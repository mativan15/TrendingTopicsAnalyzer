Local attorney and investor Eric Guster is creating opportunities for food truck owners to expand their services in a new location in downtown Birmingham.

Guster opened a food court at 1104 Third Ave. N. and is already hosting a taco truck as well as Frozen Rooster's food truck.

The idea behind the food court is to provide a level of stability for the food trucks so customers know where to find them on a consistent basis. Both Frozen Rooster and the taco truck are currently open for business at the Third Avenue North food court.
