The Canadian government has put Hockey Canada under the microscope.
Sports Minister Pascale St-Onge has ordered a financial audit of an out-of-court settlement involving a woman who alleged she was sexually assaulted by junior hockey players following a Hockey Canada event in London, Ont.
A motion also passed Thursday in Canada's House of Commons summoning Hockey Canada to Canadian Heritage's standing committee 'to shed light on its involvement in a case of alleged sexual assaults committed in 2018.
