The expectations headed into Snap's Q3 results were so low that some analysts attempted to be contrarian at the 11th hour by saying there was a chance of good news.  Well, it was even worse than anticipated.  And now the chances that Alphabet's Google and Meta also suffered the same fate last quarter are even higher.  It was like déjà vu. Snap stock cratered more than 25% in the after-hours trading session Thursday after it reported its weakest ever revenue growth and held back from providing Q4 guidance.
