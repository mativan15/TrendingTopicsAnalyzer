SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — After the first round of play at the 2022 NCAA Div. I Men's Golf Championship, it's Course: 30, Field: 0.
Every team in the field at Grayhawk Golf Club finished over during Friday's opening round thanks to a firm-and-fast test of golf that left players and coaches scratching their heads.
Vanderbilt was the best of the bunch and leads the way at 2 over after minimizing mistakes at the tricky track in the desert. Sophomores William Moll and Cole Sherwood and freshman Gordon Sargent each minimized mistakes to sign for rounds of even par and sit T-8 on the individual leaderboard.
