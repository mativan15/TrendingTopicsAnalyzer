Along with the Pixel phones, watches and earbuds at Google's annual showcase of software and devices last month came a pair of nifty-looking translation glasses. Put them on and real-time 'subtitles' appear on the lenses as you watch a person speaking in a different language.
Very cool. But the glasses aren't commercially available. It's also unlikely they will make anywhere near as much money as advertising does for Google's parent, Alphabet Inc. Of the company's $68 billion in total revenue from the quarter ending March 31, 2022, about $54 billion came from advertising.
