Albert Okwuegbunam was expected to replace Noah Fant as the Denver Broncos' primary receiving tight end this season, but that's looking less and less likely now.

Okwuegbunam drew six targets in the team's season opener, which seemed like an early sign that he would be the TE1 this year, but his targets then dropped to 2, 2, 0 and 1 from Weeks 2-5. He was replaced in the lineup by blocking tight end Eric Saubert last week and was then inactive in Week 6.

Denver used a third-round pick to select UCLA tight end Greg Dulcich in April's draft and after missing the first five games with a hamstring injury, Dulcich made his NFL debut on Monday and looked sharp.
