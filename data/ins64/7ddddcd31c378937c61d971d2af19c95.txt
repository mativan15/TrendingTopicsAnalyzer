There is no world in which J.D. Vance, Mike Lee, and Herschel Walker won their recent debates — except, perhaps, in an election cycle where debates no longer matter. Walker, who set low expectations for himself ahead of Friday night's showdown with Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock, overshadowed his typical incoherence and dishonesty by flashing a fake police badge — a gesture that elicited a scolding from the moderator for bringing a prop on stage. Lee, the two-term Republican senator from Utah locked in a tight race against independent Evan McMullin, used a prop of his own Monday as he sidestepped questions about his efforts to help Donald Trump overturn his 2020 election loss, hiding behind a pocket Constitution to avoid addressing his fraudulent elector plot texts with Mark Meadows.
