For the first time in program history the Notre Dame baseball team is headed to their second-straight Super Regional appearance.  This comes after the Irish beat Texas Tech for a second time in three days and won the Statesboro region with a 3-0 record. Next up for the Irish is now a date with the runaway favorites to win the entire College World Series this year, Tennessee.
Just how good are the Vols?
They've gone an absurd 56-7 on the year after putting up a 25-5 mark in SEC play.  They haven't lost since May 14 and have nine players who have hit 10 or more home runs this year.
