Mumbai: is seen reporting a high double-digit fall in the bottomline for the seasonally weak quarter ended September, weighed down by lower cement prices and higher input costs. Estimates given by analysts show that the cement major's consolidated net profit could fall up to 38% from the year-ago number of Rs 1,314 crore. While the net profit is seen declining, the topline is expected to see a year-on-year (YoY) growth on the back of higher volume offtake. Consolidated net sales are seen rising 12-20% on year from Rs 11,743 crore.
