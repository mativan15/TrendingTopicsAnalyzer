The YSRCP bus yatra is a farce, says G.V.L. Narasimha Rao.
Coming down heavily on Andhra Pradesh Assembly Speaker Thammineni Seetharam, BJP Rajya Sabha member G.V.L. Narasimha Rao has said that it is undemocratic for the Speaker to address a political meeting. Addressing the media here on Friday, Mr. Narasimha Rao took strong exception to Mr. Seetharam speaking at a public meeting organised by the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) as part of its bus yatra at Gajuwaka in Visakhapatnam on Friday.'Once an MLA is elected as the Speaker of the House, he or she must be politically neutral, despite his or her affiliation to political party.
