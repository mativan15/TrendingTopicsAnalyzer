A leading anti-fuel poverty campaign group has accused the Tories of abandoning vulnerable people to the cost of living crisis as they run a "zombie government paralysed by infighting and personal ambition".

Liz Truss's resignation on Thursday after just weeks in office has triggered the second Tory leadership contest in four months, with the victor set to be decided by Friday 28 October.

Tory MPs are now scrambling to find a successor who can govern the warring party, with previous leadership hopefuls Penny Mordaunt, current Leader of the House, and former chancellor Rishi Sunak, tipped as frontrunners.
