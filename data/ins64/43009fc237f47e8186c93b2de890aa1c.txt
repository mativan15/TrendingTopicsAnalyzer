CUPE P.E.I. says its support service workers have worked hard and often short-staffed throughout the pandemic and deserve to be included in the health-care retention incentive program. (Maggie MacPherson/CBC)The P.E.I. government's incentive program to recruit and retain nurses and other health-care workers has overlooked the essential work support service staff do, says their union. CUPE P.E.I. said its workers who do jobs such as laundry, cooking, and sterilization, need to be offered bonuses along with nurses, paramedics and others.
