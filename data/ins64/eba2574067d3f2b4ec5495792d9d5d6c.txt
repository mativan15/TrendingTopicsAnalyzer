PUNE: The state government has approved two town planning (TP) schemes for Uruli Devachi and Phursungi. These are the first TP schemes after a gap of nearly 40 years in Pune. City engineer Prashant Waghmare on Friday said, "They will help in the planned development of nearly 371 hectares in both areas." The PMC and Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) had declared three TP schemes some four years ago for the two areas. The civic body declared the details of the government's approval on Friday.
