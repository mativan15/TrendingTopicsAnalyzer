By Australian Associated Press Published: 23:31 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 23:31 EDT, 18 October 2022 Enough sand to fill 120 Olympic-sized swimming pools will be used to manage coastal erosion at a Newcastle beach. Deputy NSW Premier and Regional Minister Paul Toole said 300,000 cubic metres of sand would be used at Stockton beach, where coastal erosion has been a problem for decades. Newcastle City Council has been sandbagging parts of the beach to reduce the impact of erosion for years, and has developed a coastal management plan that includes long-term actions to manage and protect Stockton's coastline.
