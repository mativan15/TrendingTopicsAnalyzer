Popeyes is offering its Cajun-style turkey for doorstep delivery as families begin planning their annual Thanksgiving festivities.

Customers can pre-order the holiday bird online for delivery, with shipping slated to start Monday, Oct. 24, according to a Popeyes news release. The order should arrive in one to three business days once it ships.

Online pre-orders are available to residents living in the U.S., excluding Alaska and Hawaii.

The Cajun-style turkey is also available for in-store pickup at local restaurants while supplies last, the release said.
