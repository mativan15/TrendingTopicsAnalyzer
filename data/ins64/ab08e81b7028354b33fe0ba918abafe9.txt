Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves is the latest PlayStation exclusive to make its way to PC. The collection, which includes Uncharted 4 and Uncharted: Lost Legacy, releases tomorrow, October 19, for $50. If you're thinking of picking it up, there's a way to get Legacy of Thieves for a bit less than retail price. Fanatical is selling the collection for $45 until the end of the day (October 18).The best part about this deal is that you'll get a key to redeem on Steam, so you're not losing anything by purchasing your key from Fanatical instead of directly from Steam.
