Rick Parry is determined the English Football League will not accept 'crumbs' from the Premier League table when discussions over financial redistribution finally take place.

EFL chairman Parry has been awaiting meaningful dialogue with the top flight over a new funding package since an independent fan-led review into football governance was published last year.

Among the recommendations of the review was that the Premier League, which currently offers parachute and ‘solidarity' payments to EFL clubs, should provide more financial support for the game's pyramid.
