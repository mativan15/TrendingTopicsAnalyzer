(Bloomberg) -- Startups that provide abortion pills by mail saw a groundswell of attention after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade earlier this year. Today, though, the founders of two abortion pill companies say that raising money from investors has been complicated.Hey Jane, which provides Mifepristone pills for inducing abortions to patients in eight states, recently closed a $6.1 million funding round, the company told Bloomberg. The round, which was oversubscribed, came mostly from female investors, Hey Jane said.
