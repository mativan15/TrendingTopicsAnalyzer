Spencer Platt American Express (NYSE:AXP) posts its Q3 results on Friday before the market open and investors will be focused on travel spending and earnings guidance. Travel and Entertainment spending will be key for the company that once advertised, "Don't leave home without it." In Q2, the company reported that demand for global Travel and Entertainment in April exceeded prepandemic levels for the first time. Q3 will show if that wanderlust has truly returned. The credit card company is expected to earn $2.
