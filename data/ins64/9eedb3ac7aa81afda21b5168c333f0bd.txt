A Quebec cancer patient who crowdsourced hundreds of thousands of dollars for an experimental treatment in Texas may not be able to continue it as ICU costs burn through her available funding. In July, 22-year-old Chambly woman Maria Muscari went to Houston Texas for an experimental cancer treatment after exhausting options in her home country. The family crowdsourced $350 thousand through their online fundraiser to make the trip and pay for treatment. But just a handful of months later, the family is nearly out of money after an unfortunate turn for the worse in Muscari's condition.
