K-pop superstars BTS are enlisting in a different type of army.

The band consisting of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook will serve in South Korea's military as required by law, the band's label confirmed Monday, ending public debate among lawmakers and fans (dubbed the Army) about whether the group qualified for exemption.

All seven members will fulfill their requirement to serve and not seek any further delays or special exemptions, Big Hit Music said, sharing that the global pop stars will reconvene as a group again around 2025.
