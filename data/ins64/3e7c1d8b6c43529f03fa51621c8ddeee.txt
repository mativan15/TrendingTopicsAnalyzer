The 2023 WM Phoenix Open will feature the top PGA Tour golfers playing for a lot more money than in previous years.

The PGA Tour announced that the WMPO will be one of the tournament's 'elevated' events, meaning the Top 20 players are required to play and the purse money was raised from $8.2 million to $20 million.

The elevated status will not change the tournament's field of 132 players or eligibility requirements.

'We are obviously extremely excited and honored for the WM Phoenix Open to have an elevated purse and feature so many of the best players in the world for the 2023 PGA Tour season,' 2023 WMPO tournament chairman Pat Williams said in a statement.
