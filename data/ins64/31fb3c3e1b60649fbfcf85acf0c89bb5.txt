We've got additions to mystery series' today, as well as non-fiction about a sensational 19th-century murder case. We'll start with the most anticipated — John Sandford's 32nd Prey thriller and two thrillers by Brian Freeman, including his 11th featuring Duluth cop Jonathan Stride.

'Righteous Prey' by John Sandford (Putnam, $29.95)

Lucas Davenport and Virgil Flowers are back where they belong — together — in their second joint book (after 'Ocean Prey').

Sandford's most recent Prey novel was 'The Investigator,' giving Lucas' daughter, Letty, a chance to have her own story.
