Oct. 18—A three-story self-storage business is proposed off Falcon Parkway/Ga. 13 near Interstate 985's rapidly growing Exit 14.

BLT Martin Road LLC is seeking to build the 120,000-square-foot facility at 4153 Falcon Parkway behind Memorial Park Funeral Home and across from Zion Hill Baptist Church.

The 4-acre site is also north of H.F. Reed Industrial Parkway/Martin Road and off a new road planned between Falcon Parkway and Overbrook Drive.

BLT is seeking a conditional use permit, as the property was rezoned in 2020 to highway business with plans for a "small retail development.
