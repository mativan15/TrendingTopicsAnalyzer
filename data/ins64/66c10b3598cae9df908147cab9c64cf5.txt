In wake of a steep rise in violence in J&K, Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday held a review on the security situation in the UT. NSA Ajit Doval, Army chief General Manoj Pande, and J&K LG Manoj Sinha were among those who attended the meeting. Shah instructed the administration to ensure security of migrants and Kashmiri Pandits. The meeting came after terrorists carried out a series of targeted killings in the Kashmir Valley that include non-Muslims, security personnel, an artist and local civilians.
