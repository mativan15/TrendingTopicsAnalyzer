Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:BW) insiders who purchased shares in the last 12 months were richly rewarded last week. The stock climbed by 12% resulting in a US$66m addition to the company's market value. Put another way, the original US$569k acquisition is now worth US$629k.

While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.
