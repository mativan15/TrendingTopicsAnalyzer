Jun. 4—PRINCETON — Vouchers for spay/neuter services were distributed after a day at the Mercer County Animal Shelter, but it's important for pet owners to actually use them so state funding will not be reduced, the shelter's director said Thursday.

The animals shelter started offering its spay/neuter voucher program Wednesday. The program was limited to Mercer County residents, and only two vouchers per household. Executive Director Stacey Harman said the vouchers were soon gone.

"We actually distributed all we had yesterday," she said Thursday.
