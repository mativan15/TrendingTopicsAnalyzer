Our Verdict

On balance, the Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 2 Max is an excellent all-round gaming headset that sounds fantastic, connects to just about everything, and has a long battery life. Unfortunately, buggy connectivity makes it hard to recommend right now.

The Turtle Beach 700 Gen 2 Max replaces the 700 Gen 2, which made its mark in no subtle way as one of the most popular licensed Xbox gaming headsets with PC compatibility.

Like its predecessor, the 700 Gen 2 Max sounds fantastic, consistently proving its worth with brilliant low-latency wireless audio and spatial surround sound that immerses you deeper into your game each time you play.
