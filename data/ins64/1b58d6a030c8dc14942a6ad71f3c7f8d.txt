Prime Ministers seem to come and go from Downing Street faster than you can say 'tofu-eating wokerati' these days.  As the UK Government descends into absolute chaos, at least we're getting some laughs out of it. First there was the Liz Truss lettuce, and now everyone is making the same joke about 10 Downing Street.  People are saying that the famous address for the PM may as well be listed on Airbnb, given that the stays at Number 10 seem to be getting shorter and shorter. The meme that's going around shows a picture of Number 10 Downing Street with the Airbnb logo and the tagline ‘Perfect for short stays'.
