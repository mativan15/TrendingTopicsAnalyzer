Despite being the Etonian chairman of one of the oldest auction houses in the world and married into one of England's oldest landowning families, Christie's Orlando Rock has always downplayed his poshness. Partly, this is because 53-year-old Rock, who was appointed chairman in 2016 after beginning his career on Christie's front counter in 1990, is keen to make the art world more accessible. 
Emerging from behind his enormous desk wearing an Hermes necktie, Rock – who rarely gives interviews – is preparing for next week's launch of London Now, a summer season of accessible exhibitions, events and auctions.
