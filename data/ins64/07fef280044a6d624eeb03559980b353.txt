Over two years after a twelve point doctrine was formulated on the basis of a report by a team of five Commandants of India Reserve Battalions in Himachal Pradesh who visited districts of Kinnaur, and Lahaul & Spiti bordering China, most of the recommendations continue to be a work in progress in the BJP ruled hill state even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his recent rally in the poll-bound state, asked electors to re-elect 'double engine government' to power.
In detailed presentations given to Himachal Pradesh governor and Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur on July 10, 2020, and to the state council of ministers on July 11, 2020, the commandants made recommendations for strengthening security along the Indo-China border in the state.
