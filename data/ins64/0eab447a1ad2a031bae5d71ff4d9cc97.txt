Ireland's first space mission has reached a 'huge milestone' with the signing of an agreement with the European Space Agency (ESA) to facilitate the launch of the Eirsat-1 satellite next year, the project's director has said.Prof Lorraine Hanlon of University College Dublin also said there were 'plenty of ideas' for possible future missions and how Ireland could 'capitalise on all of the skills, knowledge facilities that have been developed so far'. A larger satellite that will build on the work of Eirsat-1 and proposals around space weather monitoring are among possible future projects being developed at UCD.
