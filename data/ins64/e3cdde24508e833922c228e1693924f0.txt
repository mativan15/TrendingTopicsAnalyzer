Rafael Nadal says his French Open quarter-final victory over Novak Djokovic finished ‘too late' after a late-night thriller between the two tennis legends went into the early hours.
The Spaniard, who has won the title at Roland Garros 13 times, booked his place in the semi-finals in Paris after overcoming his arch-rival Djokovic in four sets with a 6-2 4-6 6-2 7-6 (7-4) win.
However, the match was hard fought, with many of the games lasting over 10 minutes, before Nadal's victory in a tiebreaker in the fourth set put an end to the four-hour contest at 1.
