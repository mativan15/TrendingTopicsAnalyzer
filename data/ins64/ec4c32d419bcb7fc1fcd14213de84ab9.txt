WASHINGTON/JOHANNESBURG – Delays in restructuring Ethiopia's debt due to the failings of a new global mechanism for resolving debt problems are 'disappointing,' the east African nation's state finance minister said on Saturday, adding that he planned to raise it with the head of the IMF later in the day.

Africa's second-most populous country requested a debt restructuring under the Group of 20's Common Framework process in early 2021, but progress has been complicated by a civil war that broke out in November 2020 and has delayed progress with creditors on a debt workout.
