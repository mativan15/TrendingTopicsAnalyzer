The Tarrant County commissioners threatened to defund judges as a way to force changes in the juvenile court system. On Wednesday, their efforts failed.

During a tense meeting, the judges who serve on the county's Juvenile Board refused to take any action over problems with overcrowding in the juvenile detention center. Several of them pointed to the fact that the Nov. 8 election will put a new person in charge of the commissioners, who could keep the two associate judge positions funded beyond Jan.
