Losing a key architect of the modern-day Meta (FB) in Sheryl Sandberg is a hit to the Facebook parent's business, one long-term Wall Street analyst says.

'If you look at the issues, this is no question a blow. She has had a massive impact. There will be a massive hole left by her departure,' said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill on Yahoo Finance Live.

Sandberg said Wednesday in a Facebook post she is stepping down as chief operating officer (COO), a role she has served in for 14 years. The long-time Meta exec has been the public face of the company for years, and has helped guide the business through multiple high-profile crises such as the Cambridge Analytica debacle.
