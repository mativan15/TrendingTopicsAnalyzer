Early in Kim Coles' career, she was given advice from the founder of Comic Strip Live, the New York City comedy club where Eddie Murphy became a star. He told her she needed to do one of two things: 
'‘[He said] you either need to lose 40 pounds and become like a babe and that will get you in. Or, you need to gain 40 pounds.' And he told me to become the next Nell Carter,' she told me on 'Renaissance Man.' 
She took the first path.
'I went on a quest, dropped a lot of weight really quickly and unhealthily,' she said.
