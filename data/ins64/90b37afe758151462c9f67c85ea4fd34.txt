The Grape Escape near the Appleby Rd end of McShane Rd can, I think, be considered a Nelson institution of casual dining in a delightful semi-rural environment. The business grew and thrived under the ownership of John and Penny Appleman until they decided it was time to retire and sold the business to Brad and Nicki Deane two years ago. With recent developments in the area The Grape Escape is no longer semi-rural, it is on the doorstep of what is currently the regions' largest residential development with a number of premium producers and retailers joining them at the site.
