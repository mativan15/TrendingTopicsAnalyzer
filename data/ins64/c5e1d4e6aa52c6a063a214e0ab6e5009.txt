Bernie Winter (played by Jane Hazelgrove) was well and truly stitched up during the latest instalment of Coronation Street. She found herself arrested for burglary charges thanks to her corrupt doppelganger Fern (Gabrielle Glaister). However, fans are convinced they have worked out how Bernie avoids a lengthy jail sentence. Bernie and Fern realised they looked alike when they were given the wrong order at a fancy clothing shop.Fern later suggested she could pose as Bernie at her speed awareness course in a crafty way to make some money.
