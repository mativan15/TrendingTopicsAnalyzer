 Carole Middleton is bringing her party supplies to the United States! Kate Middleton's mother made a trip across the pond to visit ShopRite grocery stores in New Jersey, where her brand Party Pieces is now being sold for the first time outside the U.K. In photos shared on the brand's Instagram page Tuesday, Carole browses the aisles where balloons, gift bags, themed plates and more are displayed next to photos of the creator. Carole visited the stores to "meet associates, speak with customers and see our product ranges on the shelves," according to the Instagram post.
