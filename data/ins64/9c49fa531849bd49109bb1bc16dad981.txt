Selma Blair bid farewell to Dancing With the Stars, Monday. In 2018 the actress revealed she was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. But she didn't let that stop her from coming on the show and putting on some amazing performances. Unfortunately, it just became too much for her. 'I can't go on with the competition,' Blair told her partner, Sasha Farber. 'I pushed as far as I could.' Blair explained that she has been monitoring her body since the competition began, and that doctors had discovered some damage to her body.
