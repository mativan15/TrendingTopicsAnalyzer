The soon-to-be public company RXO Inc. has secured a $100 million term loan needed to pay part of its costs to XPO Logistics Inc. for its impending spinoff. It will start trading on a 'when-issued' basis Oct. 27 on the New York Stock Exchange.

What will become RXO has about 5,900 full- and part-time time employees. The XPO divisions that will form the new company had about $4.7 billion in revenue last year and more than $2.5 billion for the first half of 2022.

As a part of XPO Logistics (NYSE: XPO), RXO was a first mover 10 years ago to digital brokerage for trucking.
