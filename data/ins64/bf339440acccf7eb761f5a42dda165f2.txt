SAN FRANCISCO — Nuggets coach Michael Malone so appreciates Nikola Jokic taking over a game and leading the way on both ends.

Jokic had his 77th career triple-double with 26 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists playing with a sore right wrist he had taped, and Denver edged Golden State 128-123 on Friday night in a rematch of the teams' first-round playoff series won by the Warriors in five games on their way to the title.

"My biggest challenge for Nikola is always finding a way to use his voice and be a leader," Malone said.
