Menacing graffiti targeting Northern Irish actor James Nesbitt is being treated by police as a hate crime.
A threatening message targeting the Cold Feet actor was daubed on a wall in the predominantly unionist town of Portrush in Co Antrim.
It read: ‘1x king, 1x crown, no Pope in our town James Nesbitt.'
The message appeared weeks after the OBE holder was the keynote speaker at an Ireland's Future event in Dublin organised by a campaign group advocating for a united Ireland.
A spokesman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland said: ‘Police in Coleraine received a report of graffiti on a wall in the Bushmills Road area of Portrush on Wednesday 19th October.
