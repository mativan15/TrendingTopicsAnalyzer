The Japan Crypto-Assets Association (JVCEA), a legally recognized self-regulatory body made up of crypto exchanges, is looking to get rid of a "lengthy" screening process that currently precedes the listing of tokens on local exchanges, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.

The measures could take effect as early as December, and would only make it easier for exchanges to list crypto assets that are already known to the Japanese market. By March 2023, the JVCEA could also "scrap pre-screenings" for tokens that are new to the market, according to the report.
