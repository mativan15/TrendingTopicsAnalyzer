At the BCCI's Annual General Meeting (AGM) on Tuesday, former India player Roger Binny is set to replace Sourav Ganguly as the new Board President. Apart from Binny, the other office bearers of BCCI to be inducted — or re-inducted — include secretary Jay Shah, Ashish Shelar (treasurer), Rajeev Shukla (vice-president) and Devajit Saikia (join secretary).

Arun Dhumal, the outgoing BCCI treasurer, will be the chief of the newly formed IPL governing council. The issue of ICC chairmanship will also be discussed at the meeting, to be held in Mumbai.
