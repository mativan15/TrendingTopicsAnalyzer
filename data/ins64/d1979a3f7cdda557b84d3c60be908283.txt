It wasn't the best day at the office for Josh Allen, but him and Patrick Mahomes went down to the wire against Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers in the latest chapter of 'The Match.'
The young duo came up just short.
Mahomes had the better day between him and Allen overall, but right down at the end, Allen almost stuck a dagger.
Tied heading into the final hole, Allen had a ridiculously long putt lined up perfectly. It fell just short:
