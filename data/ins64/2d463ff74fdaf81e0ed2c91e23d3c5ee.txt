A groom who hired Guy Sebastian to sing at his Venice wedding has denied seeking to support him by giving untrue evidence at the embezzlement trial of the pop star's former manager.

Christian Bugno testified he spoke to Sebastian about the wedding transaction many years ago, but later told the jury the singer texted him on May 23 at 12.27am Las Vegas time.

Sebastian, whose cross-examination at the trial continued on May 24, began a chain of texts to him with one saying: "Brother sorry but this is so urgent cause I'm in court".
