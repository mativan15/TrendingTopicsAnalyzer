Many investors seem to have lost hope ahead of a critically important Q3 earnings season.In fact, sentiment for technology stocks — which is a proxy for risk appetite — is as negative as it's been since 2008 and 2001, wrote senior technology and software analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities in an October 17 note. That claim, which Ives told Insider in a message on Monday morning is based on conversations that the analyst has had with investors, isn't hard to believe.Higher interest rates in the face of rampant inflation have weighed on spending from consumers and companies alike, Ives noted, which is a key driver behind lower earnings revisions.
