Legendary Hollywood star Anna May Wong is set to become the first Asian American to be featured on U.S. currency.

The groundbreaking actress — who appeared in more than 60 films, television shows and stage productions and continues to inspire actors and filmmakers today — will be the fifth coin released by the U.S. Mint as part of its American Women Quarters Program, a four-year initiative that highlights the accomplishments and contributions made by women.

Four women have already received the honor in 2022: astronaut Sally Ride, activist and poet Maya Angelou, the first woman chief of the Cherokee Nation Wilma Mankiller, as well as the suffragist Nina Otero-Warren.
