The sun in fellow air sign Gemini may find you stepping out of your comfort zone this month! This is an exciting opportunity to switch up your usual routine. You could be traveling at this time, and Gemini season also bodes well for your studies or any publishing work. Mercury has been retrograde for the last few weeks, which may have brought miscommunications or misunderstandings, but Mercury retrograde in Taurus ends on June 3, moving conversations forward, especially about money or shared resources in your relationships (in love, business, or otherwise).
