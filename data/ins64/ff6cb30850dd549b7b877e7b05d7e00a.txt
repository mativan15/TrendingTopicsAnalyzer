Welcome to Screen Gab, the newsletter for everyone waiting to see whether a topsy-turvy season pays of for HBO's first 'Game of Thrones' spinoff.

In this week's Screen Gab, we look back on the highs and lows of 'House of the Dragon' Season 1 as we ready ourselves for Sunday's big finale — and offer a slew of recommendations in other genres (animation, documentary, mystery, small-town medical dramedy) for those of you who don't know a Targaryen from a Hightower.

And, as always, we'd love to hear what you're watching, too: with your name and location.
