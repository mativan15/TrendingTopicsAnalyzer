Phoenix-based Nikola Corp. has confirmed its plans to build a hydrogen production hub in the Phoenix metro across a nearly 1,000-acre property it purchased through Phoenix Hydrogen Hub LLC in September.

The site is located just south of the Arizona Department of Corrections Lewis Prison and west of State Route 85 at 28702 W. Patterson Road in south Buckeye.

The vehicle maker announced that its working with its partners to build a large-scale hydrogen supply and dispensing infrastructure business to support Nikola's truck customers in addition to third-party demand.
