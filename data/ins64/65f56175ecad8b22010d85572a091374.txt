The Love Is Blind pods are open and ready for new romance as Netflix announced the fresh batch of singletons looking for love in season three.
For the uninitiated, the hit programme – which first aired in 2020 – follows a group of singles who get to know each other without seeing each other, and only meet face to face after they decide to get married.
And after that, it's pretty much go go go, as they jet off on honeymoons before moving in together, with their weddings taking place weeks later.
