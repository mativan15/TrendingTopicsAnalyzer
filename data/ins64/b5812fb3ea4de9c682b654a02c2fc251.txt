When the Jacksonville Jaguars hosted the Indianapolis Colts a month ago, the visiting AFC South rival was without its top two receivers, Michael Pittman Jr. and Alec Pierce.

The depleted Colts offense looked lost against the Jaguars defense in a 24-0 shutout. Indianapolis quarterback Matt Ryan threw three interceptions and running back Jonathan Taylor was held to 54 rushing yards.

In the Week 6 rematch, the Colts will have Pittman and Pierce, but this time the team will be without its top two running backs, Taylor and Nyheim Hines.
