With Halloween coming, taking advantage of our video doorbell deals to avoid being a completely clueless victim of ding-dong ditching might not be a bad idea. We've found a great deal with the inventive people over at eufy, offering its Security Video Doorbell 2K at an impressive $64 off this weekend. That'll drop the $200 home security device down to $136. This deal ends in the wee hours of this Sunday night. Luckily, the deal is easy to take advantage of.
