Residents of a quiet Halifax neighbourhood are shaken after a police chase Sunday afternoon sped through several lawns and ended with a suspect vehicle wedged between a building and fence.
According to a Halifax Regional Police release, officers first 'noticed' a vehicle that had been reported stolen from Pictou County at around 2:45 p.m.
It was heading inbound to Halifax on Old Sambro Road, and patrol members tried to conduct a traffic stop, but the vehicle fled.
The truck was soon found on Randolph Street, which is a cul de sac.
