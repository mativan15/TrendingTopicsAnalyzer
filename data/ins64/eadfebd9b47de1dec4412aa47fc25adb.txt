British Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned Thursday – bowing to the inevitable after a tumultuous six-week term in which her policies triggered turmoil in financial markets and a rebellion in her party obliterated her authority.She said: 'I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected.'Just a day earlier Ms. Truss had vowed to stay in power, saying she was 'a fighter and not a quitter.' But Ms. Truss couldn't hold on any longer after a senior minister quit her government with a barrage of criticism and a vote in the House of Commons descended into chaos and acrimony just days after she was forced to abandon many of her economic policies.
