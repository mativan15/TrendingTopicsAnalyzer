In less than a month, voters must fill three of Fountain Valley's five city council seats, including one left vacant by an outgoing councilman, Michael Vo. There are two incumbents, veterans, past and present public servants as well as professionals from the fields of education, medicine and the tech industry among the 13 people vying for a position on the governing body.

Fountain Valley is not divided into council districts, which means every candidate is pooled into the same race. Voters will be asked to select up to three candidates on their ballots.
