Chinese social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings, which reported flat revenue in the first quarter, has adjusted its salary policy to make it harder for employees to receive pay rises, according to an internal letter seen by the South China Morning Post. As part of the change, employees who receive a promotion are no longer entitled to an "immediate" salary increase, and the salary review process has been pushed back by a month from June to July, according to the letter. The authenticity of the letter was confirmed by Tencent employees.
