A buzz could be returning to Lyttelton's main street at a venue that was once home to laughter, tears, and the clatter of cutlery. The site at 24 London St has been little more than an empty space since the historic Harbour Light Theatre was demolished in 2011 after the earthquakes. But now the wheels are in motion for a new build which will see a commercial space on the ground floor, topped with 10 one-bedroom apartments on the two upper storeys. The new building is based on a model barely seen in Canterbury – communal living.
