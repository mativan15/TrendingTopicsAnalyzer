Hargreaves Lansdown has been hit with a lawsuit on behalf of thousands of investors in Neil Woodford's fund, the first time the FTSE 100 funds supermarket has been sued over its promotion of the once star stockpicker. RGL Management, a claims management firm, is seeking hundreds of millions of pounds in compensation for investors from Hargreaves Lansdown and fund administrator Link Fund Solutions in a lawsuit filed in the High Court. The lawsuit is the first to target Hargreaves Lansdown, which recommended Woodford's funds on its influential 'best buy' list of investments until the £3.
