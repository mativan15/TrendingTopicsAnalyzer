The San Diego sun got the better of Juan Soto here.
On Wednesday, the Philadelphia Phillies were looking to add to their 1-0 lead in Game 2 of the NLCS against the San Diego Padres. With runners on second and third and one out, Matt Vierling hit a ball out to deep right, where Soto was waiting to make the snag.
Unfortunately for Soto, the 2 p.m. afternoon sun was just a bit too strong with the right fielder losing track of the ball as it fell to the ground. Due to the error, the Phillies doubled their lead to 2-0 and kept runners in scoring position.
