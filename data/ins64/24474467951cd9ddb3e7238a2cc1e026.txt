Sustainability is increasingly becoming an issue that businesses must pay attention to. Changing consumer attitudes, impending regulations and the desire to move away from costly and damaging fossil fuels have encouraged companies to set new sustainability strategies. Profitability and sustainability do not need to be mutually exclusive, said SAP CEO Christian Klein in the keynote address at the SAP Sapphire 2022 conference in May. Indeed, SAP has made sustainability a top corporate priority, both by setting ambitious goals for itself and offering a slate of products aimed at helping customers set and manage their own sustainability goals.
