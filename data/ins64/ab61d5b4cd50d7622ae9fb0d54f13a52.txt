Paula Ratliff is an openly gay woman who is trying to forge a future for women working in the tech industry.

For Ratliff, being openly gay is a point of pride, but she admits that during her 22 years working at a staffing company, she could not be her truest self.

'It's been a long journey, and I probably came out in my late 20s or so, after college,' Ratliff said. 'I spent most of my career avoiding pronouns. I would talk about my significant other, I would talk about my partner.'

After decades in staffing, Ratliff took on a new challenge.
