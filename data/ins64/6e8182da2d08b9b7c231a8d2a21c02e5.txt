LG is partnering with game engine maker Unity to create a 3D copy of our homes and populate them with ultra-lifelike digital humans.

LG explains that the idea is to create a "digital twin" of our living spaces(Opens in a new window) and offer us a meta-home to explore from the comfort of our real homes. While it may seem strange to sit at home and "spend time in a dynamic, virtual version" of it, LG is going to make the interaction useful.

Any LG products installed in your home will feature in your meta-home and you can adjust their settings, features, or functions without having to interact with them directly.
