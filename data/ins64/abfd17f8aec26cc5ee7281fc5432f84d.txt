Former village of Hawthorn Woods Trustee Kim Lynch and Vernon Township Trustee Sara Knizhnik are battling it out for an open Lake County Board seat in District 18.

Lynch, a Republican, entered the picture late when could-be incumbent Catherine Sbarra was removed from the ballot after a lengthy legal back-and-forth over whether she was eligible once redistricting and a move from a 21-member board to a 19-member board resulted in her residence narrowly being included in District 17, which is represented by Republican Michael Danforth.
