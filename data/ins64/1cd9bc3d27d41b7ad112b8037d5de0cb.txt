Spitting Image star Matt Forde says he is 'a little happy' he can soon stop doing his 'terrible' Liz Truss voice following her resignation as Prime Minister.The impressionist said it would be 'comedy gold' if Boris Johnson returns, who he also voiced on the satirical puppet-based sketch show, but that the ramifications for the UK would be 'unthinkable'.Mr Johnson – who was holidaying in the Caribbean when Ms Truss announced her resignation on Thursday – has not confirmed if he will go for the top job, though some Tory MPs are voicing support for his return as PM.
