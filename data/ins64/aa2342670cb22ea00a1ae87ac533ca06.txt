We've reached Week 7 of the college football season, and it's the most loaded collection of games we've seen yet.

Saturday features six ranked vs. ranked matchups, including three enormous games where both teams are undefeated. Things begin in the noon window with a Big Ten clash between Michigan and Penn State before a massive SEC showdown between Tennessee and Alabama and a huge game in the Big 12 between Oklahoma State and TCU. That all gives way to a tasty Pac-12 showdown at night between USC and Utah.
