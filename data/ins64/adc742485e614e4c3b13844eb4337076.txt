(Reuters) - Money managers such as Janus Henderson Group and investment firms including Blue Owl Capital Inc are weighing potential offers for Credit Suisse Group AG's U.S. asset management unit, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.

The Swiss bank is seeking buyers for the business as part of a multi-pronged effort to revise its strategy and raise capital following a string of scandals and financial setbacks.
