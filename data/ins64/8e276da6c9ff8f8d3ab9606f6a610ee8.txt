Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News The first five months of the year have been tough ones for SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) and other fintech companies. Shares of SoFi are down 52% in 2022 as investors became more wary of the fintech sector due to deteriorating growth prospects in a post-pandemic world. SoFi is not the only fintech that is looking at steep losses this year, however: PayPal's (PYPL) shares are down 55% year to date and Upstart (UPST) has seen a 67% valuation decline. Taking advantage of the decline, SoFi's CEO has purchased shares of SoFi throughout the correction period, with purchases accelerating in May.
