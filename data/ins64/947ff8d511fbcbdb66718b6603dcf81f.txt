Forest beat Huddersfield 1-0 in the Championship playoff final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday to secure its return to the English Premier League next season. The most lucrative match in soccer - it's worth 170 million pounds ($215 million) in future broadcast money and guaranteed earnings - was settled by an own-goal by Huddersfield defender Levi Colwill just before halftime.
