The Buy an Acre concept proved irresistible: real acres in a real place for real and affordable money – acres you could go out to the Belize rainforest and see for yourself. The project, run on the ground by Programme for Belize, has 110,000 of forest and today is an island of biodiversity in a sea of the most brutal monoculture.
A key part of the Belize project was Roger Wilson, who had worked overseas in extreme places most of his life. He instilled the presiding principle of the way WLT operates: you are working with local organisations – and they are the bosses.
