LOS ANGELES, Calif. (AP) — An armored car guard was shot and wounded Monday in Los Angeles County by robbers who fled with an undisclosed amount of money, authorities said.

The guard had parked the Loomis armored car to pick up money at a Bank of America in the Harbor City area, south of downtown Los Angeles near Carson. He was walking back to the car at about 11:15 a.m. when at least two masked confronted him, the county Sheriff's Department said in a statement.

At least one suspect began shooting, hitting the guard several times in his legs, and the robbers then fled in a black sedan, the Sheriff's Department said.
