General Mills has announced the sale of its stake in an Israeli joint venture based in the occupied West Bank, the company announced on Tuesday. The subsidiary, which primarily sells breads and dough-based snack products under GM's Pillsbury brand name, will be acquired by Bodan Holdings, which already holds 40% of the joint venture.  

While GM – and the Israeli media – described the move as part of a wider divestment from European markets motivated solely by financial concerns as part of a strategic effort 'to drive superior returns,' the anti-occupation Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement has hailed the pullout as a victory for its own activism campaign.
