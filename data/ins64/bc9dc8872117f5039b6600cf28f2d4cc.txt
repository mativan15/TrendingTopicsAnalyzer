Oct 17 (Reuters) - Canada's resource-heavy main stock index climbed on Monday, in an upbeat start to the week as higher crude and gold prices boosted shares of energy and mining firms with some traders betting the market has bottomed out.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index jumped 1.61% to 18,621.02, also mirroring strong gains on Wall Street. Still, the Canadian benchmark index is down 12.2% this year.
