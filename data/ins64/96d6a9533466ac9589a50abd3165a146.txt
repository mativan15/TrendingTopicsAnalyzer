British Prime Minister Liz Truss has resigned after six weeks in office, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in U.K. history.
Truss took office on September 6, two days before Queen Elizabeth II died, after her predecessor Boris Johnson resigned over the summer amid several scandals. 
Like Johnson, Truss dealt with the resignations from senior ministers over her failed policies and chaos within the Conservative Party days before her resignation announcement.
