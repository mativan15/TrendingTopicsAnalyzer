In just a few weeks, season 5 of The Crown is set to drop on Netflix, introducing viewers to the new roster of actors taking over as members of the royal family in the acclaimed drama.
Elizabeth Debicki has succeeded Emma Corrin as Princess Diana, with Dominic West taking Josh O'Connor's place as then-Prince Charles and Imelda Staunton stepping into Olivia Colman's shoes as the late Queen Elizabeth II.
While many fans are excited for the historical drama to return – which depicts true as well as dramatised versions of events – there has been concern over the way the show is going to handle the portrayal of Princess Diana's death in the new episodes.
