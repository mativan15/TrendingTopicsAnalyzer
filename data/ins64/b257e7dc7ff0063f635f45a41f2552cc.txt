Shares of Arvind Fashions Limited have delivered over 80 per cent return to its shareholders in the last one year. The stock is now down over 25 per cent from the recent high which essentially puts the stock in bear territory. However, brokerage firm Anand Rathi believes that the company is on track to its target of profitable growth, working capital optimisation, de-levered balance sheet and rising cash flows. It has a 'Buy' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 453 per share. It highlighted that the company has managed inflationary pressures through pricing power in focused brands, efficiencies of lower discounting, and economies of scale to maintain margins.
