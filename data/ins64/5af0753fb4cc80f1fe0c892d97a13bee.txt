As it scrambles to quickly secure more power for Ontario's grid, Premier Doug Ford's government is going to guarantee payment to new carbon-intensive natural gas plants, even in the event they are shut down to lower emissions.

Energy Minister Todd Smith announced this month that Ontario will be procuring 1,500 megawatts of new natural gas generation with contracts that run to 2040.

His ministerial directive specifies that if there is a future law requiring the plants to capture all their carbon emissions — like the federal government is currently proposing — but they can't do so and have to close, they'll get paid anyway.
