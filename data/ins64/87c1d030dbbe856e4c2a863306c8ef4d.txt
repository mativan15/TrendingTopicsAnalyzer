Seoul approves reconstruction of dilapidated Eunma apartment complex SEOUL, Oct. 20 (Yonhap) -- An antiquated southern Seoul apartment complex long at the center of the nation's real estate policy debate due to its massive size and location in the wealthy Gangnam district has obtained a long-awaited reconstruction approval, the city government said Thursday, signaling its intent to speed up its plan to increase the housing supply. The Seoul city government's Urban Planning Committee convened Wednesday to approve a reconstruction plan by Eunma Apartments, a complex of 4,424 apartment units in 28 buildings built in 1979 in the Daechi-dong district of Gangnam Ward.
