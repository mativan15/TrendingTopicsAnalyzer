Britain's Got Talent has crowned Axel Blake as its 2022 winner!
The comedian was left a little lost for words after Ant and Dec announced his name, saying: ‘I'm shaking, thank you everyone for voting for me…I can't believe it.'
Singer Tom Ball and ventriloquist Jamie Leahey – and his puppet Chuck the chicken – both made the top three, but missed out on the title.
Axel, 33, delivered a stream of jokes during his incredible final performance, including that he had heard a member of the public mistaking him for the rapper Stormzy, but with the added weight.
