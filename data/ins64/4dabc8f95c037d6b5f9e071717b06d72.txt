Welcome to the kickoff of this year's Power 100, the NBJ newsroom's annual list of the most powerful people in Nashville's business community.

Power 100 is an assessment based on our newsroom's reporting and expertise covering the region's high-powered business community to know who's driving decisions, both in the headlines and behind the scenes. We focus on who is having the greatest influence on Nashville's businesses, workforce and economy.

As in years past, to develop our list, we asked ourselves a series of questions: Who has the power to move the market? Whose clout reaches beyond their company or industry? Who in the business community does the mayor or the governor call for help? Who do you need to know to do business in this town? Who is likely to shape our futures?

We'll again reveal this year's list by category: Connectors, Dealmakers, Disruptors, Heavy Hitters, Industry Giants and Trendsetters.
