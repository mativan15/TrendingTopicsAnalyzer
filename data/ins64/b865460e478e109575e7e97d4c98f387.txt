Snap (SNAP -9.44%), the parent company of Snapchat, took investors on a wild ride after it went public at $17 per share on March 2, 2017. The stock opened at $24, but tumbled over the following two years and sank below $5 a share in December 2018. But the bulls eventually rushed back, and Snap's stock closed at an all-time high of $83.11 last September.
Today, Snap's stock trades at about $15 again. Therefore, a $1,000 investment in its IPO would be worth less than $900 today. Let's see why Snap's stock collapsed -- and if it will ever recover.
