Giancarlo Stanton already has made an impact in left field — literally. 
Stanton made a running catch on Yuriel Gurriel's fly ball and then his hand temporarily broke part of the scoreboard during the fourth inning of the Yankees' Game 1 ALCS showdown vs. the Astros on Wednesday night at Minute Maid Park in Houston.
Stanton, who already has four putouts, had one rough play so far in left field. In the first inning, Jeremy Peña belted a double to left-center field that he appeared to take a bad route on.
