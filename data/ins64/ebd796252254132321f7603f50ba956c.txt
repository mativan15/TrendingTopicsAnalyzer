This is us.

We are a nation that spends billions and even deploys our military to protect other nations.

We are a nation that does not fear to hold other nations accountable over issues such as terrorism, nuclear weapons, trade, intelligence and global warming.

We are a nation that elects leaders who refuse to support legislation to deal with shortage of infant formula.
