In the backdrop of Union Home Minister Amit Shah releasing MBBS textbooks in Hindi here, Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath has asked why a similar initiative with an engineering course was shelved in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled state.
On Sunday, Shah released textbooks in Hindi of three subjects for the first year students of MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery) as part of an ambitious project of the Madhya Pradesh government to impart medical education in the Indian language, a first in the country.
