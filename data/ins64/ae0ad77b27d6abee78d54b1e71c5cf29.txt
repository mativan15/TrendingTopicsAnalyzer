While Americans have to settle for a small handful of Kit Kat flavors, Japan's convenience stores and Kit Kat Chocolatory shops stock a vast, awe-inspiring range of flavors, from yuzu wine to pudding to seasonal wonders like sakura mochi. That's why Japanese Kit Kats, which come in over 400 flavors, inspire cultish devotion among candy lovers (and make the all-time best food souvenirs.) In fact, for nearly every prefecture in Japan, there is a distinct Kit Kat flavor, meaning that you could do a Kit Kat tour of Japan.
