Jun. 2—When legislative advocates for legalizing cannabis were pushing their cause, they said the industry would bring in tens of thousands of dollars a year in new revenue.

The state Revenue and Licensing Department last week provided a first glimpse of how much tax revenue the state might expect from marijuana sales, which became legal April 1. The state reported retail shops paid more than $2.4 million in excise taxes in April and more than $1.6 million in gross receipts tax.

Taxation and Revenue Department spokesman Charlie Moore said Wednesday the excise tax figure is closer to $2.
