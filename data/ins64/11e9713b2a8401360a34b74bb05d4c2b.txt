The 20th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will start on Sunday, October 16, 2022, in Beijing. CCP General Secretary and China's President Xi Jinping is all but guaranteed to stay at the helm for a third term after the congress.
Yet while he will emerge from the congress more powerful than ever by placing more loyalists in the party's apex bodies, the Politburo and its Standing Committee, both Xi and the CCP face difficult questions that have no answers at the moment.
The extent to which Xi is able to reshape the CCP's leadership group and bring major changes to policy directions depends on how much support he has among the 2,296 delegates attending.
