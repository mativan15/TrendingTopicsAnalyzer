Comedian Chelsea Handler has signed on to host the next Critics Choice Awards, set to be held in January. The announcement means that the streak has ended for Taye Diggs, who hosted the show for four consecutive years — including in 2022, with Nicole Byer. The 28th annual Critics Choice Awards will take place Sunday, January 15, 2023 at 7 p.m. ET, live (for the Eastern and Central time zones, delayed in the west) from the Fairmont Century Plaza in Los Angeles. After being simulcast last year on TBS, this year it appears that the ceremony will once again be exclusive to The CW.
