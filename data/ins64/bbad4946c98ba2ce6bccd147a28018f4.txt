TOKYO (Reuters) - The weak yen forced Suzy Iwamoto to raise prices on imported wines at her bar and bottleshop in Tokyo by about 10% last month, and she fears more hikes may be inevitable after the yen plumbed levels this week that were last seen 32 years ago.

On Friday, a day after the yen slid past 150 per dollar, the government reported that core consumer inflation hit an eight-year high of 3.0% in September.

Prices on some 20,000 food and drink items in Japan have gone up this year, according to researcher Teikoku Databank, particularly prices for imported items.
