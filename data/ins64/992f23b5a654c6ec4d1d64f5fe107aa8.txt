British Prime Minister Liz Truss apologized for policy "mistakes" that caused investor confidence to evaporate and her poll ratings to plunge before nearly all of her economic plan was finally shredded on Monday, but she said she would not step down."I do want to accept responsibility and say sorry for the mistakes that have been made," Truss told the BBC."I wanted to act but to help people with their energy bills to deal with the issue of high taxes, but we went too far and too fast."Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt, who was appointed on Friday after Truss sacked her close ally, Kwasi Kwarteng, jettisoned the remaining major planks of her economic agenda on Monday, including scrapping almost all of Truss's unfunded tax cuts and scaling back her vast energy support scheme.
