Collider.com Hulu is really getting into the Halloween spirit in 2022, with October bringing with it the addition of a number of great spooky titles. This month has already seen the addition of the Blade trilogy, Dark Shadows, and The Exorcism of Emily Rose, not to mention the brand-new Hellraiser movie that's making waves right now. But while Hulu is bringing a whole lot of great movies and shows to its catalog in October 2022, there are also quite a few titles leaving the streaming service.
