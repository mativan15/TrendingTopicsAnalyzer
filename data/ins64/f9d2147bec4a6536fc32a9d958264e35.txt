TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's economy minister has drummed up new business worth T$30 billion ($940 million) in meetings with top executives at four major tech firms in California's Silicon Valley, the ministry said on Saturday.

Wang Mei-hua has been in the United States all week to respond to what her office has called "concerns" about supply chains and geopolitical issues.
