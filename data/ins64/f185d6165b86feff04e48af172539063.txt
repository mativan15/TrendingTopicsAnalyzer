(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday will lay out his vision for the city's revival as an international financial hub during his maiden policy address, which is likely to include measures to ease property taxes and visa restrictions.Lee's speech before the Legislative Council will seek to answer Beijing's calls for Hong Kong to better serve as a bridge between mainland China and the rest of the world.But his task -- Lee's first annual policy presentation since taking office July 1 -- is a tough one.
