Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he's disappointed that Ottawa's leading mayoral candidates are promising not to use 'strong mayor' powers the province instituted last month. 'I think it's very, very disappointing,' Ford told Newstalk 580 CFRA's The Morning Rush with Bill Carroll on Monday. 'A mayor gets the big office, the big title and he has one vote. Why run for mayor then?' Catherine McKenney, Mark Sutcliffe and Bob Chiarelli all said at the CTV Ottawa mayoral debate last week that they would not use the new powers.
