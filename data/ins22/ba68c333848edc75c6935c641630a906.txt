A new mural depicting Terry Fox outside the University of Toronto's Rehabilitation Sciences Building honours the legacy of the Canadian hero and marks the route he took through the city in 1980 during his Marathon of Hope to raise money for cancer research. A celebration was held Thursday to mark the completion of the project – a partnership between U of T, the City of Toronto and the Legacy Art Project, itself part of the ArtworxTO initiative – that towers over University Avenue. Toronto artists Alexander Bacon, Que Rock and their team of 20 people worked on the eight-storey mural for nearly a year, using 400 cans of spray paint.
