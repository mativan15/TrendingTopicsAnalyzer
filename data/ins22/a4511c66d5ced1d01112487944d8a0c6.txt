How Ireland missed rugby's first revolution is a long story. How the Irish sporting community has missed their national rugby league team, The Wolfhounds, currently competing in Rugby League's World Cup is another.In the 1890s English rugby was dominated by teams from northern England. Yorkshire and Lancashire were rugby's powerhouses. Players from these working class areas, many of them coal miners, began to request, not unreasonably, that they be compensated by their rugby clubs for missing work shifts due to injuries sustained while playing.
