LendingClub's latest paycheck to paycheck report shows 1 in 8 (12.3%) of people making $250k or more per year have 'issues paying their bills.'

Definitely a WTF stat from this survey, but I haven't dug into whether these high earners who struggle to pay bills are located in higher priced cities. That's the only thing that comes to mind that would justify this.

Otherwise it sounds a lot like profligacy.
