Turkey

The Gentle Barn

Have you ever wanted to snuggle a turkey? If so, we have the event for you!

This Thanksgiving, Gentle Barn facilities in California, Missouri, and Tennessee are inviting the public to a special pre-meal event where, in exchange for a modest donation, you can cuddle rescued turkeys, feed them treats and join staff and other visitors for pie, crafts, music, and games.

"These animals are living their best lives, and anyone lucky enough to meet or spend time with them will discover they are highly affectionate, intelligent, social, protective towards their families, and gentle with humans," a news release states.
