By Joe Hoppe Billington Holdings PLC said Tuesday that 2022 has started positively, performing in line with market views and securing a number of contracts. The structural steel-and-engineering specialist said the new year began well following a year of partial recovery from the coronavirus pandemic in 2021, and that it was meeting market views despite macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in material availability, price volatility and inflationary pressures. It didn't provide any figures. A number of large industrial contracts have been secured and the company has a significant pipeline of opportunities, it said.
