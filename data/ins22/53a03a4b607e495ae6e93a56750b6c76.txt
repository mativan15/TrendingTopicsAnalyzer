MANCHESTER UNITED should splash the cash on trying to sign Harry Kane, according to ex-Red Devils and Tottenham striker Teddy Sheringham.
The Spurs talisman has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford in the past, but so far the Lilywhites have held onto their man.

However, Man Utd are set to search for someone to lead the line for them come the end of the season when Cristiano Ronaldo's contract expires.
