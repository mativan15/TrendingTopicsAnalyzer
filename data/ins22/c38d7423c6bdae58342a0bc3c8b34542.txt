The mayhem caused by anti-social street racing is likely to cost Palmerston North ratepayers $300,000 for actions to thwart the gatherings and clean up afterwards. In the past year the council has responded to pleas for help from harassed and sleep-deprived business owners and residents around Works Rd in Longburn and Valor Drive near Palmerston North Airport about the mass skid parties. Council chief infrastructure officer Sarah Sinclair said $50,000 had been spent on installing road treatments like speed bumps.
