As Russia's war in Ukraine continues, some Russian cities have announced plans to scrap New Year's events to help the country's armed forces.But not everyone is on board with the plan, with some voicing criticism of the Russian government's failure to adequately equip troops."Tempers fly, as not everybody is happy with the government's failure to properly equip the troops, leading to proposals to cancel the New Year's festivities and spend the money on the military," Julia Davis, the creator of the Russian Media Monitor watchdog group, tweeted on Sunday, alongside footage of Russian politicians and pundits fiercely debating the issue.
