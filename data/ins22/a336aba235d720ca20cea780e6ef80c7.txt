A local food company is launching its smoothie products in South Korea. Seriously Healthy is launching its Serious Smoothie products, which have been available in food service retailers since 2016, into South Korea after success in Australia and Fiji. The brand sells organic fruit bites, frozen and dried fruits, while Serious Smoothies is a range of frozen single-serve pouches of real frozen fruit pieces. Founder Samuel Rosser said the smoothie sachets would make it easier to make a healthy smoothie.
