New Jersey's Democratic House candidates are out-raising their Republican opponents 4-to-1 — even in the state's four most competitive districts.

Democratic candidates have a roughly 8-to-1 advantage over Republicans in the amount of cash they have left in the bank — $31.2 million to $3.9 million, according to reports recently filed with the Federal Election Commission.

In the state's four most competitive districts — the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 11th — Democrats' cash-on-hand advantage is 10 to 1: $23.
