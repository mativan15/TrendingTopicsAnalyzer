Anna Faris has named acclaimed filmmaker Ivan Reitman as the director who allegedly behaved inappropriately with her on a movie set. 
The Scary Movie actress has previously shared her alleged experience of sexual harrassment and misconduct while working on the 2006 movie My Super Ex-Girlfriend, which Reitman directed. 
However, she never named the star at the centre of her allegations. 
Reitman, famed for directing Ghostbusters, died in his sleep in February 2022 at the age of 75. 
In the latest episode of her podcast Anna Faris is Unqualified, the actress spoke to Girls creator Lena Dunham about her experience in Hollywood.
