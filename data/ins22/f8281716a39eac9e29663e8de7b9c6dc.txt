MADISON, Ill. (AP) — Chase Briscoe finally has a pole to go with his first NASCAR Cup Series victory earlier this season.

The second-year driver for Stewart-Haas Racing drove through a bobble at the end of the backstretch and turned a lap of 138.274 mph on Saturday, giving himself the best starting spot for the first time in his 51st career start.

'The first round I felt like I under-drove extremely bad. The second round I felt like I over-drove,' said Briscoe, who won in March at Phoenix — a track that shares many of the same characteristics with World Wide Technology Raceway.
