Every investor in One Liberty Properties, Inc. (NYSE:OLP) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don't tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.

One Liberty Properties is a smaller company with a market capitalization of US$581m, so it may still be flying under the radar of many institutional investors.
