Dave Gantar, an internationally renowned soccer referee, was able to close out his career on the same field he began it on in 1987. At 12 years old on the pitch at John Barnett School in Edmonton, Gantar began refereeing for 'slurpee money.' 'To come full circle, to start here and then end here is such a good feeling and… this was a thanks to the game, is what I would say for all the years its been good to me and it's my chance to give back a little,' said Gantar. 'You can see the kids happy and loving to run around and that's what the game's all about.
