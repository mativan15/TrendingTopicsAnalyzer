NFL icon Tom Brady was left furious with the performance of his Tampa Bay Buccaneers as they slipped to an embarrassing defeat to the Pittsburgh Steelers that threatens to derail his retirement swan song. Tampa Bay fell to a 3-3 record as the Steelers - who moved to 2-4 - claimed a 20-18 win. Backup quarterback Mitch Trubisky led Pittsburgh to the unlikely win after replacing injured rookie Kenny Pickett. Trubisky threw a six-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter while Brady struggled against the Steelers defence, who snapped a four-game losing streak with the win.
