The two interceptions returned for touchdowns were even more important. The result was a 42-34 win over the New Orleans Saints on Thursday night that the Cardinals needed to keep pace in the NFC West. The Cardinals (3-4) can't expect to replicate the heroics of Marco Wilson and Isaiah Simmons, who each had a pick-6 late in the first half to turn a tight game into a fairly comfortable win.
