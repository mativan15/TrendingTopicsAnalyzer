Andy Cohen has hinted that Jen Shah is done with the Real Housewives of Salt Lake City after being a no-show at the programme's panel at BravoCon on Saturday.
Shah was seen in New York City over the course of the weekend, with many fans curious as to why she didn't join her co-stars for the highly anticipated event.
Television host Cohen, however, has since appeared to claim that since the reality star plead guilty to fraud and money laundering charges, her relationship with the show has come to an end.
