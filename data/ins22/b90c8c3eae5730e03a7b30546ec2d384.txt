May 30, 2022 08:44 PM Eastern Daylight Time OSAKA, Japan--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nippon Shokubai and Arkema are joining forces to launch feasibility studies and establish a joint venture for the construction of an industrial plant for the production of LiFSI (Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide) ultrapure electrolyte salt, a key component of battery cells for electric mobility.



Ultrapure and high performance LiFSI electrolyte salts, a key component of car battery cells, will speed up the development of new electrolyte formulations for the next generations of batteries, including semi-solid and solid state batteries, by significantly increasing their power, stability, cycle life, and recyclability, while reducing charging time in high or low temperature conditions.
