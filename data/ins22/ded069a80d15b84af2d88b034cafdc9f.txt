Women spent more time online than men, an average of 4 hours 11 minutes compared to 3 hours and 46 minutes (PA)

Media regulator Ofcom has urged tech firms to do more to keep women safe online after a report found that they were more likely to be negatively affected by internet abuse.

The study found women felt less able to share an opinion online and were more likely to be targetted by unsolicited sexual images. Women from minority ethnic backgrounds were also twice as likely to have been sent unwanted sexual messages compared to white women, it's claimed.
