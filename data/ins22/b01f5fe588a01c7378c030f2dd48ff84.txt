Nancy Pelosi, the only woman to hold the position of speaker of the House of Representatives, is one of the richest members of Congress.
The 82-year-old politician has an estimated net worth of more than $106 million, according to a New York Post analysis.
The figure was calculated using the methodology of the Center for Responsive Politics for calculating the net worth of Congress members, which involves getting the average of the maximum and minimum estimated value of assets and liabilities.
Pelosi's most recent financial disclosure pegged her maximum net wealth at $252 million and the minimum at $40 million.
