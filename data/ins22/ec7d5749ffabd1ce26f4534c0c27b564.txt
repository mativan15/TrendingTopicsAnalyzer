Detaining a person in Louisville Metro Department of Corrections could be a death sentence, as evidenced by eight preventable deaths in just the past seven months. The jail is overcrowded, understaffed, and ill-equipped to address the needs of those who are held there.

One cause of this deadly overcrowding is a type of warrant called a bench warrant. There are thousands of active bench warrants that have been issued by Jefferson County District Court against people who have missed a court date. This means someone could be arrested and incarcerated simply because they did not make it to court one day.
