Ahead of Diwali, the Prayagraj fire department has constituted mobile units which are carrying out regular inspections of places where firecrackers are being manufactured, stored or are put to sale. The teams are creating awareness and are issuing warnings if any negligence is found. The department has also come out with strict rules for cracker markets.
