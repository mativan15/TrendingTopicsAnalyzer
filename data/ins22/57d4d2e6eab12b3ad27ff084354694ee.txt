Our Eagles vs. Cowboys predictions for Week 6 originally appeared on NBC Sports Philadelphia

The Eagles (5-0) are hosting the Cowboys (4-1) on Sunday Night Football at the Linc.

To the predictions:

Reuben Frank (4-1)

The Cowboys have some serious star power. Micah Parsons and DeMarcus Lawrence. Trevon Diggs. CeeDee Lamb. Ezekiel Elliott and Tony Pollard. I sat here for a while trying to figure out how the Eagles could possibly contend with all those superstars.
