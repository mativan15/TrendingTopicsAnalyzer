Already considering cutting primetime programming in the 10 p.m. hour, NBCUniversal is now also mulling early retirement offers for veteran staffers age 57 and older. Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that while no formal offers have gone out, the conglomerate is looking to save costs by offering buyout packages to select employees across the entire company who have been with the company for 10 or more years and who are age 57 and older. The voluntary early retirement offers are poised to be sent out to eligible employees next week and are considered another way to cut costs and potentially avoid or minimize additional layoffs at the company as linear ratings continue to slide and streamer Peacock has effectively been a nonstarter.
