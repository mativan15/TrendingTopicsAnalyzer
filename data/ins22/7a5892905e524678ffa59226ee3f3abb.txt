IvelinRadkov PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC) recently reported decent Q3 earnings, topping expectations by a few cents per share. The immediate price reaction was negative after the report, with the price falling about -2% that day. Right now, the stock is down about -33% off its recent highs. It seems like a good time to review PNC's valuation to see if it's worth buying. I always like to start my articles by reviewing any previous coverage or ownership I've had with a stock. In PNC's case, I actually managed to bottom-tick this one in my marketplace service, The Cyclical Investor's Club, during March 2020 COVID crash, and I wrote about it publicly several weeks later in my article "Stocks I Bought Dip: PNC Financial".
