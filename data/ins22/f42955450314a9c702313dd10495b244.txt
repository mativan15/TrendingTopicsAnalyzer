Stone by Isaac Lamb Stone will release their debut EP Punkadonk next month.
'Money is a very special song for the band, as it's the first track where the lyrics were co-written between Fin and Elliot,' they comment.
'The song shares both of their emotions and perspectives on the world today and the anxieties we face. The song is a statement of emotion about the state of this planet and how it feels growing up into adulthood in the current climate.
'Fin and Elliot come from very different lives and the mix of their lyrics makes the song the force it is.
