The UK's Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will start sending the second instalment of cost-of-living payments to recipients of low-income benefits. The cash handout of £650 (R13,318) in total for each eligible family was a bid under Boris Johnson's government to help consumers as prices started to creep up in the northern hemisphere spring.The measure had been part of a £37bn (R758bn) support package for households before Liz Truss's Treasury announced other policies shortly after she took office.
