An action group has been awarded £2 million to fight climate change.

Ouse Valley Climate Action successfully bid for the lottery cash, beating more than 600 other applicants.

The group, a partnership of ten East Sussex organisations including the South Downs National Park Authority and Lewes District Council, focuses on 'natural solutions' to climate change, such as planting trees to capture carbon.

Vanessa Rowlands, chairwoman of the South Downs National Park Authority, said: 'I'm delighted that the Ouse Valley has won this significant funding, which will help make it one of the national leaders in community climate action.
