The double murder trial began Wednesday with Somerset County Judge Scott Bittner issuing a bench warrant for one of the prosecution's star witness, Jasmine Browning (Hinton), 27, formerly of Columbus, Ohio.

Browning/Hinton was called to the stand on Tuesday and made it halfway to the witness stand in courtroom No. 1 before turning around and walking out. It appears she ran, for Senior Deputy Attorney General Evan Lowry II told the court at the beginning of Wednesday's session that she is unavailable for testimony because she cannot be found.
