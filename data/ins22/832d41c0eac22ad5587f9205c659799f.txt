Collider.com Watch an average modern American horror movie and you're bound to be inundated with a lot of noise. Loudness is not innately a bad thing, nor are pronounced jump scares. But lackluster scary films can often end up being so underwhelming because they mistake loudness for creepiness. Something like Smile or Fall will often just ratchet up the volume of the score or pile on noisy jump scares instead of coming up with actual substantive frights. If one wants a master course in how to make quiet horror cinema that chills you to the bone, look no further than the 1988 George Sluizer feature The Vanishing.
