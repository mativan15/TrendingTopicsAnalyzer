Manchester United are close to agreeing a £70m deal with Barcelona for Frenkie de Jong but still face a fight to convince the midfielder to leave the Nou Camp.

Erik ten Hag worked with De Jong when the pair were at Ajax and is keen to reunite with the 25-year-old at Old Trafford.

Ten Hag, who has signed a three-year deal at United, wants to bolster his squad with a new striker, midfielder and centre back this summer, with the likes of Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani and Jesse Lingard leaving the club following the 2021-22 campaign.
