The Pentagon is set to expand its use of Elon Musk's SpaceX satellite capabilities despite a recent dispute between the two sides over the funding of satellite-based internet services for an embattled Ukraine, according to government documents.

Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the formal name for the company that Mr. Musk founded more than two decades ago, is already a major Pentagon contractor, handling sensitive national-security launches on its rockets. Those ties are set to grow into satellite services where SpaceX's Starlink division is a dominant player in key regions, the documents said.
