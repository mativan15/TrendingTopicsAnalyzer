WASHINGTON — With the country reeling from three mass shootings in the last three weeks, President Joe Biden called on Congress to deliver 'common-sense' reforms to curb gun violence during a rare prime-time address from the White House.Biden has tried to give lawmakers space to find the sort of bipartisan compromise on this issue that has eluded them in the aftermath of countless shootings going back decades.But his seizing of the bully pulpit also reflected a determination to show the country his own passion and commitment to eradicate a distinctly American epidemic of gun violence and an optimism that even a deeply polarized Congress and Republicans long opposed to tightening gun laws could be spurred to act.
