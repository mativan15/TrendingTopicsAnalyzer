Bank of America has been quietly doing things right it seems. Third quarter results on Monday were a good illustration of its steady, deliberate progress.Like rivals, Bank of America was given a big helping hand by the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, which have fueled strong growth in income from lending. But Bank of America is also holding on to more fees and commissions than peers and it saw a smaller swing in loan loss provisions compared with the same period last year.The upshot: Overall revenue after provisions looks more stable than rivals and grew year on year in spite of the slowdown in investment banking and some trading in the midst of worries about a deteriorating economy.
