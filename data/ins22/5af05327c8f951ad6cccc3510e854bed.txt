Athens, Greece – Key European tourist destinations are set for a summer season largely without Russian visitors amid sanctions over the war on Ukraine and actions taken by Moscow.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought to punish countries that have imposed sanctions against his country. On April 4, he suspended aspects of a 2006 visa facilitation agreement between Russia and 'unfriendly' members of the European Union that have imposed sanctions against Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.
The following day, Putin issued a travel advisory urging Russians not to travel to 'dangerous' European countries.
