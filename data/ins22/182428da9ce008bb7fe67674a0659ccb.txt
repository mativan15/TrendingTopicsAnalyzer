Apple Inc. executives said last quarter that they had yet to see economic pressures impact consumer demand for the iPhone, but investors are going to need more convincing this time around.The consumer-electronics giant continues to be dogged by reports that executives are hemming production of new iPhones ahead of Thursday's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, and that has fueled concerns about slackening demand for the expensive hardware in an inflationary climate.
