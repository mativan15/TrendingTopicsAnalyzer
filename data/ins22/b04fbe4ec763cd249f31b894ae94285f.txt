One of the best Samsung Galaxy deals all year is currently available at the official Samsung Store this week, with a trade-in saving of up to £580 (opens in new tab) and a free Galaxy Watch 4 being offered with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 is a pretty expensive phone, with a starting price of £1,649, but with this trade-in deal the price could go down to at least £1,399, if not more. This definitely qualifies it as one of the best Samsung phone deals out there at the moment and you can even spread the cost over 12 to 36 months with Samsung Finance and pay 0% interest.
