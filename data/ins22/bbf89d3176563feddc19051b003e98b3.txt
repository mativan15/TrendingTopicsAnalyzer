Minister for Environment, Climate Change, Siva V. Meyyanathan on Sunday said that the government was planning to use satellite technology to monitor saplings planted to increase forest cover. Speaking at the World Environment Day celebrations organised by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board here, he said forest fires would be monitored and bought under control using such technology. 'We will know if any trees are cut in any forest,' he said.
