Fundraising by former President Donald Trump's primary political group briefly quadrupled for a few days after the FBI searched his South Florida property in August. But the group also reported a significant increase in fundraising expenses during the third quarter, according to a POLITICO analysis of new campaign finance filings.

The data provides further evidence of how law enforcement's decision to seize classified documents from Trump's resort energized the former president's base. And it shows how the former president's political operation is churning through the GOP's small-donor pool at an accelerating pace as a potential comeback campaign draws near.
