Twenty early-stage Arizona startups have been named as finalists, and five more have been selected to make main-stage pitches, for the IdeaFunding event that will hand out more than $50,000 in prize money for winning funding presentations next month.

The Nov. 3 IdeaFunding event is a part of the Tenwest Festival that is co-led by Startup Tucson and the University of Arizona Center for Innovation (UACI). At the event, the finalists will present their pitches — and the five additional teams will be presenting in front of a live audience.
