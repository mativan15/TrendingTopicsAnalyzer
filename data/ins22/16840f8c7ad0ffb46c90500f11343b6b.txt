When James Bond pressed the ejector button on his gear stick to launch a would-be assassin into the air in the 1964 film Goldfinger, many fans dreamt of owning a car fitted with such devices — but not the film's main star.The Aston Martin DB5 that Sir Sean Connery bought so he could drive one 'not weighed down by gadgets' is to be sold and could fetch more than £1.5 million.The family of the late actor, who died in 2020 aged 90, is selling the 1964 vehicle from his personal collection to raise money for the philanthropic fund set up in his name, which goes to good causes around Scotland and the Bahamas.
