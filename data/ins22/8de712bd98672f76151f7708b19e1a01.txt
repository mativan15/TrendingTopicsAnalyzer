Published: 06:24 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 06:24 EDT, 19 October 2022 A murderer who killed a father-of-three over a $4,000 drug debt has been described as 'inept' by a judge after he wrapped the body in a plastic sheet that had his name on it. Todd Nathan Kiernan, 30, and his accomplice Gervaise Widdowson stabbed Dinh Lam Nguyen, 51, when he visited Kiernan's house in Mahogany Creek, east of Perth, in January 2021.  A jury disagreed with his self-defence argument and found him guilty of murder on Wednesday.
