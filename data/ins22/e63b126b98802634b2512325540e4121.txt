Kanye West has reportedly hired Johnny Depp's defamation trial attorney Camille Vasquez to represent his business interests amid his brewing public-image and business crises.

The rapper-entrepreneur, who legally changed his name to Ye a year ago, is said to have retained national law firm Brown Rudnick to represent him as his contracts and deals evaporate following his spate of antisemitic remarks and false claims about the death of George Floyd, whose family is suing the rapper for harassment, misappropriation and defamation.
