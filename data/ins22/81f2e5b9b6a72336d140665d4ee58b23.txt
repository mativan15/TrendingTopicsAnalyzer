NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager David Einhorn, whose Greenlight Capital has had a long history with entrepreneur Elon Musk, in a letter on Friday said he expects Musk's deal to buy Twitter Inc. will "close at or near the originally agreed upon price."

Einhorn told his investors in August that he had bought a stake in Twitter, and now said he believes the lawsuit in Delaware that could decide the fate of the deal "is going well for TWTR."

The hedge fund acquired a new stake in the social media company in July as Twitter sued to force Elon Musk to buy the company even as the billionaire entrepreneur said he had changed his mind about the deal.
