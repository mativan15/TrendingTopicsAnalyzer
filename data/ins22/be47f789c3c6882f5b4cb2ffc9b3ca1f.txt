When Blizzard first announced Diablo Immortal, the fan reaction was...mixed. Now that we have both a Diablo II remaster and the promise of a full-fledged Diablo IV, maybe the community can better appreciate this mobile game spin-off of the beloved, satanic action-RPG. Unsurprisingly, Blizzard's classic formula pairs just a bit too well with bothersome free-to-play tactics. However, exploring dungeons, killing monsters, and scoring sweet loot remains as irresistible as ever.  Set between the events of Diablo II and Diablo III, Diablo Immortal's dark adventure tasks you with fighting your way through multiple, demon-filled regions, such as cemeteries, woods, and mountains.
