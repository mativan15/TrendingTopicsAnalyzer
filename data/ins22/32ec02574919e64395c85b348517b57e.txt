OTTAWA - The federal government has announced funding to construct and repair hundreds of spaces for women and children fleeing violence.Housing Minister Ahmed Hussen says the government will give over $121 million to build and repair a total of 430 spaces in shelters and transitional housing.The money comes from an initiative under the national housing co-investment fund, previously announced in the 2021 budget.Lise Martin, executive director of Women's Shelters Canada, says while the funding is a good start, it is 'unfortunately a drop in the bucket' to meet the high need for women seeking safe shelter.
