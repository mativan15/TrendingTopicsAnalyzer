Disgruntled wide receiver Elijah Moore was back at the Jets' practice facility on Friday, one day after he'd requested a trade over his lack of involvement in the team's offense.
But the Jets' second-round draft pick in 2021 will not play Sunday against the Broncos in Denver, head coach Robert Saleh said.
'It's part of what we deal with every day. We've had our discussion with Elijah, but trading him is not an option,' Saleh said before Friday's practice, adding that Moore is 'in the building' but not attending meetings.
