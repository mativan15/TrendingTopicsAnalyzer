The West Coast Regional Council has been warned it risks losing Government 'shovel ready' money for urgent infrastructure projects – including new floodwalls at Franz Josef Glacier and Westport – unless it acts now. Councillors did just that at an urgent meeting on Monday night, when they agreed to appoint a special infrastructure governance subcommittee made up of councillors Stuart Challenger, Brett Cummings and Laura Coll-McLaughlin. It also agreed to appoint a special project delivery team using experienced external appointees for up to three years, to oversee the raft of infrastructure projects the council has on its books.
