Till now, Northeast India has been rarely and poorly presented in mainstream Bollywood movies. And Anubhav Sinha has chosen precisely that neglected background of Northeast India to introduce his latest conscience-pricking drama, Anek. Anubhav Sinha, the director of Anek, tried to portray peace as a subjective hypothesis – peace for one doesn't necessarily render peace for all. Joshua, a covert operative agent, is assigned to bring about a circumstance that would compel the rebel leader Tiger Sangha to join the negotiation deal for a peace treaty waiting for a long time.
