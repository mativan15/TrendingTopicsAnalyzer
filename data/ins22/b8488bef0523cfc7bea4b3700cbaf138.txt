Despite economic turmoil in the tech world, an Oakland-based startup shows that moonshots are still getting funded. Felt, co-founded by Sam Hashemi and Can Duruk, wants to disrupt the role of maps in society, and rethink how we think about the medium. The startup allows users to build a map with data sets integrated into it, and work with each other to showcase impact in a less static way than your average Google maps query.

Despite a massive mission - proving that maps are a forgotten yet fundamental medium worth renovating - the co-founders cited proven business models from Figma and Notion, both valued in the billions, as reason to believe in their work.
