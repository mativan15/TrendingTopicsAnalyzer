Blackstone's third-quarter profit faltered as wild markets and rising borrowing costs chilled the pace of dealmaking at the world's largest alternative-asset manager.Distributable earnings in the quarter to September 30th fell 16 per cent to $1.37 billion (€1.39bn), Blackstone reported on Thursday. That measure of earnings available to shareholders amounted to $1.06 a share, beating analyst expectations of 99 US cent.The results promise austere times for an industry that minted wealth and amassed reach across the economy during an era of low interest rates.
