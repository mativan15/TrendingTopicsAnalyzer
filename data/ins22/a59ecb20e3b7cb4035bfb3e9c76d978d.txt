'That will dramatically shrink the amount of time black bags sit on the streets of our city,' Tisch said of the new labor schedules, adding it will help stop the 'all-you-can-eat buffet' for rats.

The proposal will also apply to businesses, which are serviced by private haulers that already make most of their rounds at night. While the DSNY is only responsible for collecting residential waste, it will soon have more robust oversight of the commercial industry under a pending regulatory plan to create new waste zones.
