Elton John will play a surprise show at Denver's Ball Arena as part of his Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour: The Final Tour, promoter AEG Presents announced Tuesday.
The Friday, Nov. 4, concert is one of 11 new dates announced this week for the tour — and it only gives fans a little over two weeks to get tickets. The Denver stop replaces a cancelled concert at Minute Maid Park in Houston.
Tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. on Monday, Oct. 24 via ticketmaster.com. The Rocket Club pre-sale begins at noon on Thursday, Oct.
