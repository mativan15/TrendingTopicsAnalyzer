Teal independent candidate for Vaucluse Karen Freyer has the kind of CV that should spook Liberals in the blue-ribbon electorate.She's Ascham-educated, hails from a prominent eastern suburbs family, had a political apprenticeship helping Yvonne Weldon become the City of Sydney's first Indigenous councillor, and boasts a pro-climate action, developer-sceptical platform that should soothe the NIMBYs of Double Bay.There's one small snafu so far – Freyer lives in Redfern, not in the electorate. Happily, Freyer signed a sales agency agreement to sell her terrace in June, and told CBD she'd be relocating to the east over the next two months.
