(CNN) — Planning on a European vacation this summer? Look out for aggressive, dangerous and drunk drivers -- at least, according to the Europeans. A new survey has found that 79% of them have a negative opinion of their fellow drivers -- while, of course, 97% of them take pride in their own excellent driving. The survey of 12,400 Europeans in March 2022 was commissioned by France's Vinci Autoroutes, which manages French freeways. It was conducted by polling company Ipsos, which asked at least 1,000 people in each of 11 countries about their own driving habits, and those of their fellow drivers, at home and abroad.
