Just Eat Takeaway.com (JET.L) has returned to profitability earlier than expected as cost cuts offset falling orders.

Europe's largest meal delivery company said it processed 235 million orders in the third quarter of 2022, an 11% drop on the year previously.

Gross transaction value (GTV), a common measure for e-commerce companies, ticked up 2% during the quarter amid higher prices, increasing by €6.92bn ($6bn/$6.
