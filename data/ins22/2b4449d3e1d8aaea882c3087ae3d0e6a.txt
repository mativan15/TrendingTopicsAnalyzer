Liz Truss's resignation after just 45 days in office has made waves across Europe and beyond, with commentators and politicians alike questioning how her government could have fallen so far, so fast – and with most blaming Brexit.'Prime minister's departure plunges Britain into profound and unprecedented political crisis,' was the headline in Le Monde, noting that next Friday Britain 'should learn the name of its third Conservative prime minister in three months'.Even that was not guaranteed, the paper's London correspondent said, since the Tory party, 'weakened by internal divisions, an absence of ideas and a lack of fresh faces after 12 years in power' may prove incapable of agreeing on a candidate.
