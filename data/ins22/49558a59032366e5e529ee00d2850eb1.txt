The biggest challenge for a cricketer today is finding a successful balance between their livelihoods by playing IPL or similar T20 leagues and wear the national team colours, representing their nation in test cricket, says Gary Kirsten, the mentor, coach and brain trust who transformed our boys in blue into men, taking them to pinnacle of the games success at the World Cup of 2011 after a gap of 28 years. 'The fact that the IPL now is the second and biggest sporting league in the world, and it's only been around for 13 years is a massive testament to the success of the product,' said Kirsten, ahead of the T20 World Cup, in an exclusive interview to ET's brand new podcast Business of Sports from Melbourne, where he is coaching the Dutch side.
