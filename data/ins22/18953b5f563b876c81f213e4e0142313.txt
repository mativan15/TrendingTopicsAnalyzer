Microsoft has updated its Surface Laptop Go, giving commercial customers the option of more RAM – but keeping quiet when it comes to Pluton.
 

The original Go was introduced in 2020 as something for customers who fancied the Surface name, but lacked pockets deep enough to afford the full-fat Surface Laptop or one of Microsoft's detachable keyboard tablets.
It's still not the cheapest in the Surface line-up (that honor goes to the Surface Go 3, currently retailing from $399.99 without a keyboard), however.
