By CBSBoston.com Staff October 18, 2022 / 12:36 PM / CBS Boston HAVERHILL -- Teachers in Haverhill entered the second day of their strike on Tuesday. A hearing is underway where teachers are fighting Monday's court injunction that ordered them back to work. "There's no place that any of us would rather be than in that building, working with our students," said Sarah Gaubin, a teacher on the bargaining team. She feels the school committee's legal action set negotiations a step back. "They kind of stalled a little bit last night but I remain hopeful that we'll reach an agreement," said Paul Magliocchetti from the school committee.
