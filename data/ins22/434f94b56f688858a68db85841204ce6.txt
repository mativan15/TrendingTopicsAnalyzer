A court in Australia has ordered Google to pay a former legislator some 715,000 Australian dollars ($515,000) in defamation damages over two videos posted to YouTube.
The Australian Federal Court found on Monday that the two videos drove John Barilaro, the deputy premier of Australia's most populous state New South Wales, to quit politics prematurely.
Judge Steven Rares said the videos, which were posted by political commentator Jordan Shanks amounted to a 'relentless, racist, vilificatory, abusive and defamatory campaign' against Barilaro.
