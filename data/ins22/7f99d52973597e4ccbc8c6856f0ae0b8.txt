China's leader Xi Jinping opened the country's 20th Party Congress, which is widely seen as cementing his unprecedented rule and also continuing to support China's 'zero-Covid' policy and its tensions with the West. Much remains to be seen in terms of what the congress will mean in the future and whether China will move away from its policies, which have brought isolation; and it also remains to be seen what the meaning of China's decisions have for the Middle East.

According to reports China's leader will stay in power for a third term.
