The company previously closed Rough because it had become too expensive to maintain. At the time, some critics warned that allowing the facility to close would be a serious mistake, leaving Britain with only a clutch of smaller sites and making it more vulnerable to imports from abroad.
Yet when asked by Centrica whether they were willing to help pay for keeping the facility open, the Government demurred, pointing to the UK's plentiful supply of gas from other sources such as interconnectors with Europe and shipments of LNG.
