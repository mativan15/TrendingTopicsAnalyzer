Colleen Michaels/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Investment Thesis Red Robin Gourmet Burgers' (NASDAQ:RRGB) performance is improving, albeit slowly. Contributions from Donatos partnership should benefit the company. The company's revenue grew 21% year over year in the latest quarter, while it generated positive income from operations. The stock's price should recover with improved operational and financial performance of the company. However, with operations-level losses dating back to 2018, it might be better to wait and watch the company's progress before buying the stock.
