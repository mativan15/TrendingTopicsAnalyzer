The Wild haven't had a lead, and the Canucks keep blowing theirs.

That should make the meeting Thursday at Xcel Energy Center between two of the NHL's last three winless teams interesting, to say the least.

"Our team has to be the more desperate team," coach Dean Evason said. "It's as simple as that. If we're not, then we'll be 0-4."

But the Wild lineup that dropped their first three games isn't expected to be in action.

Marco Rossi has been promoted after being a healthy scratch to skate alongside Matt Boldy, and Jordan Greenway is healed up and scheduled to make his season debut.
