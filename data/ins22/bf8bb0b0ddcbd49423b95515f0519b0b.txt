How Robin Wurzel ended up living on a horse farm in Spicewood is a lot like the premise of the classic TV show "Green Acres."

She's always been the city girl, while her husband, Barry, has wanted to move out to the country. She was able to resist when their kids were little and he wanted to go to Dripping Springs. They instead took up residence in the Circle C neighborhood in South Austin.

"I was just like, 'I don't know, I just can't do it,'" Robin said.

When the kids got older, and Barry still wanted to move out, she eventually relented.
