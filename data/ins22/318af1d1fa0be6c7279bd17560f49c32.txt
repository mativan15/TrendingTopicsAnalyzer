By Australian Associated Press Published: 16:55 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 18:50 EDT, 19 October 2022 Victorian treaty talks will begin in 2023 after a deal was struck between an elected Indigenous body and the state government. The landmark agreement, to be signed in an official ceremony in Melbourne on Thursday, sets out the rules and guiding principles for treaty negotiations. A statewide treaty will be negotiated with the First Peoples' Assembly of Victoria, while traditional owner groups will also be able to pursue individual treaties for their land.
