The troubled charity that runs a Chinese police station in Lower Manhattan, allegedly set up to spy on Chinese nationals in the US, held its annual gala dinner last month with Eric Adams as its honored guest — but the mayor did not disclose his participation at the event on his official agenda, The Post has learned.
Adams attended the glitzy Sept. 26 dinner at a Flushing, Queens, restaurant, sponsored by the America ChangLe Association NY Inc., which owns and operates the police station on East Broadway that has been accused by a human rights group of spying on the Chinese diaspora.
