Deutsche Bank subsidiary DWS on Wednesday said its chief executive is resigning, hours after authorities raided its offices as part of a probe into claims that the company exaggerated the sustainable credentials of some of the financial products. CEO Asoka Woehrmann is set to step down after the company's annual general meeting on June 9, DWS said. He will be succeeded by Stefan Hoops, who currently oversees Deutsche Bank's corporate and commercial client activities. In a statement, Woehrmann said DWS was profitable and stable despite difficult market conditions.
