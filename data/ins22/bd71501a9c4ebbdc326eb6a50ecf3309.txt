By PA Media Published: 03:06 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 03:06 EDT, 30 May 2022 Inclusive Capital Partners (In-Cap) has said it is considering a bid for housebuilder Countryside after two previous approaches for the London-listed firm were rejected. The investor, which is one of Countryside's biggest shareholders with a 9.2% stake, said it wants to engage with the company over a potential 295p-per-share offer for the shares it does not already own. The move is expected to value the business at almost £1.
