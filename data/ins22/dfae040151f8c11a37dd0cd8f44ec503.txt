getty What is an SD-WAN solution? An SD-WAN, or software-defined wide area network, provides connectivity to distributed enterprise networks and remote users via software overlay to manage and control underlay. This includes internet, broadband, multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) and wireless cellular.
