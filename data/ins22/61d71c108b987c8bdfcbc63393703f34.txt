The Alberta government has begun enforcing a pass for visitors to the popular Kananaskis Country mountain parks, but the NDP Opposition says it will scrap the fee if the party wins next year's election.Leader Rachel Notley says having to pay $15 a day or $90 a year for personal vehicles is unfair to lower-income people and their families.'These parks, they belong to all Albertans, and we won't put up barriers or Albertans, regardless of their income, to experiencing this outdoor gem,' Ms. Notley said Friday.
