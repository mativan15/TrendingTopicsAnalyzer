Oct 18 (Reuters) - Futures for Canada's main stock index rose on Tuesday, tracking their U.S. peers, on rising optimism around the corporate earnings season and the reversal of UK's fiscal policy.

December futures on the S&P/TSX index were up 0.9% at 6:45 a.m. ET.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index gained on Monday, with a survey showing longer-term consumer expectations on inflation have eased.

The housing starts data scheduled to come out at 8:15 ET (1215 GMT) is expected to show housing starts fell to 263,000 units last month, from 267,443 units in August.
