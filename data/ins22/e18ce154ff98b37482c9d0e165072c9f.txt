Oct. 14—HENDERSON — Bicyclists will soon have a big assist in maintaining their bikes and keeping them safe when they visit downtown Henderson.

At the intersection of Breckenridge and Wyche Streets they'll find a work stand that contains tools and other items they can use to make repairs on their bikes or other wheeled devices. In other downtown spots they'll see five bike racks.

The work stand and bike racks are part of the Bike Amenities Initiative program offered by the N.C. Division of Public Health.
