HOUSTON — Oswald Peraza got his first playoff start on Thursday night. The shortstop made a pinch running appearance Wednesday, but he was the starting shortstop for Game 2 of the American League Championship Series against the Astros.

'Yeah it was my toughest call,' Yankees manager Aaron Boone said of using the rookie instead of Isiah Kiner-Falefa Thursday night. 'I ended Framber [Valdez] being so groundball heavy. Izzy faced him a lot, put it on the ground a lot against him. I just felt like Peraza's got a little more chance of getting it in the air against him.
