Jim Ratcliffe, the British billionaire who relocated to Monaco, is expanding his presence in the Mediterranean playground known for its low taxes and glitzy casinos.

Ratcliffe's conglomerate, Ineos, created three companies in the city-state this year for the purpose of serving the larger firm's needs, according to registry filings in Monaco, where more than half of the 39,500 residents are millionaires and don't typically face taxes on income or capital gains.
