BM Technologies (NYSE:BMTX) said on Friday it had received a non-compliance letter from the New York Stock Exchange as it had failed to timely file its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31. The company said it expects to file the Form 10-Q within the next 60 days. NYSE gives six months to companies to file the Form 10-Q. The company said it was unable to file its quarterly report as BDO USA resigned as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company on May 10.
