Midnights is officially a record-breaking album. On Friday, Spotify revealed that Taylor Swift's new album had become the most-streamed project in a single day in the streaming service's history.

Sharing Spotify's tweet, Swift wrote, 'How did I get this lucky, having you guys out here doing something this mind-blowing?! Like what even just happened??!?!'

Though Spotify did not immediately release the official streaming numbers, with the accomplishment, Swift beats out Bad Bunny's previously held record after Un Verano Sin Ti garnered 183 million streams when it was released in May.
