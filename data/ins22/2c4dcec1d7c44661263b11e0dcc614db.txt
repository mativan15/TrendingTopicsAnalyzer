'It was late at night, and I was lying in bed and the spirit just told me to go online and buy one,' Israel says. 'There was only four minutes left until the drawing.' Well, that urge led to a big win for Israel and her family. When she checked her email in the morning, she saw a notification from the North Carolina Lottery that she'd won over $500-thousand.
