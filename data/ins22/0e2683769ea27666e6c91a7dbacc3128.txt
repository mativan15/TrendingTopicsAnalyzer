With Kelley School of Business Dean Idalene ‘Idie' Kesner scheduled to step down at the end of July, the University of Indiana today (June 3) turned to her reliable right hand to lead the school as interim dean. Ash Soni, executive associate dean for academic programs, will take over the leadership of the school starting Aug. 1.

Soni has long served as a chief operating officer to Kesner during her decade-long run. Their academic partnership is among the most successful ever.
