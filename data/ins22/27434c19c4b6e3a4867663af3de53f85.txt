Microsoft (MSFT 3.92%) has grown exponentially in its 47 years of business. Despite a recent market downturn, the company's stock has grown over 200% in the last five years, thanks to the potency of brands such as Xbox, Windows, Azure, and Office. These brands' success and market share will likely help the company continue growing for years to come.
However, Microsoft's stock has fallen 29% since January, along with a long list of other tech stocks. Investors who haven't been able to stay up to date on recent market trends might be perplexed as to why a dominant company like Microsoft has suffered such steep declines in 2022.
