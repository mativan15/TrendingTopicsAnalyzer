Laurence Dutton/E+ via Getty Images The Invesco China Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:CQQQ) invests in the leading Chinese tech stocks, covering a range of segments like search, social media, gaming, fintech, industrial automation, and even solar. Most readers will be aware that the group has been a disaster over the past year, with CQQQ down more than 55% from its peak in 2021.
