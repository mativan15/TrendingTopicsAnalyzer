Collider.com When looking at Luca Guadagnino's filmography, his most recent release, Bones and All is easy to deem his darkest romance yet, but Call Me by Your Name is brutal in its own right. While it lacks blood and gore, the film is an emotional stab to the heart, brimming with melancholy and tragedy beneath its dreamy pastels. The acclaimed 2017 romance follows Elio (Timothée Chalamet)'s during a life-changing summer when he experienced a magical, fleeting romance with his father's older summer intern, the 24-year-old Oliver (Armie Hammer).
