With Memorial Day sales on everything from TVs to refrigerators and patio furniture, something like a Microsoft Surface Pro tablet can easily slip through the cracks. That's a shame because the Best Buy's Memorial Day sale (opens in new tab) has a few of these fantastic Windows tablets on sale right now, including the Microsoft Surface Pro 7+ for up to $330 off (opens in new tab).The Surface Pro 7+ is the mid-cycle refresh of Microsoft's popular Surface line of products and sits between the Surface Pro 7 and Surface Pro 8.
