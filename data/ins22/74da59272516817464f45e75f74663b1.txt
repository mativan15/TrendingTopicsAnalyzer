Kim Kardashian runs a tight ship and house guests must adhere to her strict list of rules. The entrepreneur fought tooth and nail to get sole ownership of her and Kayne West's $60 million Los Angeles mansion, and she's been relishing in it since. The living room that she brands her "favourite room in the house" is entirely white and her four children aren't allowed to play in it. Taking up most of the space in the sprawling room is a giant circular shape sofa covered with over 20 cushions covering it.
