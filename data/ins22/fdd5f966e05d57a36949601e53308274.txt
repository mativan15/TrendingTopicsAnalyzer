EXCLUSIVE: Campside Media, the company behind the popular Chameleon podcast series, which documented the story of the Hollywood Con Queen, has lined up its next project – the story of the wild kidnapping attempt of Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer. The story, which is based on reporting from Ken Bensinger and Jessica Garrison, is being lined up as the sixth season of the Chameleon podcast. However, in a new twist, the company is also simultaneously developing a television adaptation and has teamed up with Jeremy Miller and Daniel Cohn, who have worked on shows such as Ally McBeal and Entourage, to pen the small-screen adaptation.
