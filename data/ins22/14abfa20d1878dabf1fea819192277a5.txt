A second alleged gunman has been charged in a February shooting that wounded a teen amid a melee involving dozens of people at a birthday party in St. Paul's Hamline-Midway neighborhood.

Charlie Pryor Jr., 18, of St. Paul, faces charges of second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon and aiding and abetting second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon in connection with the Feb. 5 shooting that injured a 15-year-old boy at a rental hall along Snelling Avenue.

Pryor's cousin, a 15-year-old boy, pleaded guilty in April to second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon.
