Russian journalist Dmitri Muratov has announced he plans to auction off the money he won from his Nobel Peace Prize in an effort to support displaced Ukrainian children amid Russia's ongoing invasion of the country. 
Muratov, who was the editor of the now-suspended news publication Novaya Gazeta, said that the $500,000 prize money will be used to support various charitable foundations, the New York Times reported. 
Muratov's Nobel Peace model will be auctioned off by Heritage Auctions in New York on June 20.
