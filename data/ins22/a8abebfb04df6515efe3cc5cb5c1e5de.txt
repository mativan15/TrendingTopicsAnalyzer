Railing against ratepayer-funded libraries, a Nelson man has started his own members-only institution. Convenor Kym Parsons is calling for donations of 'artefacts, artworks and literature', as well as furniture for The Nelson Athenaeum, which is currently housed in a room near the grandstand of Richmond's A&P Showgrounds. The venture began in January when Parsons, who has previously campaigned online for Nelson to become a separate state with its own military force, began The Nelson Library Facebook group.
