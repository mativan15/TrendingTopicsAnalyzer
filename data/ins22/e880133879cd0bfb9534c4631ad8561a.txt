KeyBanc believes the big decline in semiconductor-equipment stocks is a compelling buying opportunity.

On Sunday, analyst Steve Barger reiterated his Overweight rating for KLA (ticker: KLAC ) stock and reaffirmed his $410 price target, citing the company's strong position in key chip-equipment markets.

'While we expect [near-term] cyclical concerns will continue to dominate the conversation, we think the [long-term] trend toward accelerating data growth and requirements around higher performance chips will continue,' he wrote.
