Russian state-owned television channel has mocked the UK's Platinum Jubilee celebrations, after the country began four days of events to mark the Queen's 70-year reign.A bulletin aired by the Kremlin-affiliated broadcaster Rossiya 1 suggested Britain had 'found the money for an opulent celebration' in the middle of an energy crisis.The channel sought to juxtapose the pageantry of the day with apparently declining living standards in the UK, which the report blamed on sanctions imposed on Russia. 'The UK, which as a consequence of its sanctions against Russia is bracing for power cuts, has found the money for an opulent celebration of the Queen's platinum jubilee,' the evening news, which included a live report from a Rossiya 1 journalist in London, said.
