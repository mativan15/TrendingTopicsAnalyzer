By Justina Lee Chinese search-engine giant Baidu Inc.'s shares rose in early Asian trade on Friday after its first-quarter results beat expectations and as several analysts raised their stock-price targets. Baidu's Hong Kong-listed shares rose as much as 16% to 134.30 Hong Kong dollars, trimming its year-to-date loss to about 7%. Baidu said after Thursday's market close in Hong Kong that its first-quarter revenue rose 1% to 28.41 billion yuan (US$4.22 billion), supported by strong demand for its cloud and artificial-intelligence products.
