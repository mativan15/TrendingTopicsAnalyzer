Sharna Burgess is setting the record straight.

On her Instagram story Sunday, the Dancing with the Stars pro opened up about her decision to purchase a brand-new home — and it has nothing to do with her relationship with Brian Austin Green.

"I've been looking at properties again today. Brian's been coming with me, which is amazing. But I had a bunch of people wildly asking me why Brian and I aren't living together and why I'm buying a new house. So insane," Burgess, 36, said. "I sold my house because I made amazing money on it because the market is so incredible, and I'm buying a house because my mom is moving over here and I'm buying somewhere for her to live.
