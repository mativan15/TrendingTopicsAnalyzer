Tesla Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) third-quarter earnings report could not give its sagging stock a lift but its forward outlook evinces confidence, according to Loup Funds' Gene Munster. What Happened: As opposed to expectations of a small increase in average selling price, Tesla reported a 4% sequential drop, Munster said, attributing the decline to stronger-than-expected cheaper China sales. Automotive gross margin came in at 26.8% compared to the consensus of 27.5% but exceeded the third quarter's 26.
