The biographical note to Atticus Lish's 2015 debut, Preparation for the Next Life, lost no time answering the question: yes, he is the son of 'legendary writer and editor' Gordon Lish, whose noted severity with a blue pencil made Raymond Carver a byword for minimalism. Yet Lish Jr's other credentials were nearly as unique: in place of the usual creative writing degree and magazine credits, he listed past jobs as a removal man, builder, factory worker, security guard and (briefly) a marine. The novel itself tugged against literary trends too: outward facing, without a writer-adjacent protagonist in sight, it told of the thwarted romance between a homeless Iraq veteran and an undocumented Uyghur refugee down and out in post-9/11 New York.
