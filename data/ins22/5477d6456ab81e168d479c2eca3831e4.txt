By Sabela Ojea Shares in Nanosynth Group PLC fell Wednesday after the company said that it has changed its business strategy and has decided to stop manufacturing masks directly, as demand has dropped alongside Covid-19 restrictions being lifted. The London-listed nanomaterials company--which was previously called Remote Monitored Systems--said it now aims to sell a technology solution it is testing to media providers on a worldwide basis. The technology solution being tested is used directly within a mask's material media strands, it said.
