The BCCI announced the replacement for injured pacer Jasprit Bumrah for 2022 T20 World Cup on Friday. It will be Mohammed Shami who will fill the vacant spot and that will help the Indian side to continue having four full-time fast bowlers in the 15-member squad. Former India batter Robin Uthappa feels that Shami and Arshdeep Singh are certain to get a spot in the playing XI and it will be a toss-up between Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Harshal Patel, in case India decide to play with three pure pacers.Uthappa shared his views when asked about India's ideal fast bowling line-up.
