Opposing the appointment of Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat as the Chancellor of the Mahatma Gandhi-founded Gujarat Vidhyapith, an autonomous university, nine Gandhian trustees resigned contending that the appointment of a non-Gandhian as the Chancellor were against the ethos of Gandhian values based on which the institution was founded. There are 24 members of the trust of the 102-year-old prestigious institution that imparts education in Gandhian values and thought and is an autonomous university in Ahmedabad.
