Arsenal will drop out of the Premier League title race and the top four come the end of the season, says former player Jermaine Pennant.The Gunners are enjoying their best start to a campaign since 1903, having won nine of their first 10 games to sit top of the table, and have built a four-point gap over champions Manchester City and rivals Tottenham.Pennant is impressed by Mikel Arteta's work at Arsenal, having spent big to assemble a young, talented squad which now includes a fearsome front three of Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli and academy graduate Bukayo Saka.
