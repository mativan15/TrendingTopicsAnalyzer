HAMILTON - A lawyer for the Ontario government has told an inquest into the death of an Indigenous teen who went missing from a group home that the province can't endorse some changes proposed at the proceeding because they involve funding or changes to legislation.

The inquest has been examining the death of Devon Freeman, who was 16 when he was reported missing from the Lynwood Charlton Centre group home in the Flamborough area of Hamilton in the fall of 2017.

He was found dead in April of 2018 and an autopsy determined he died by hanging.
