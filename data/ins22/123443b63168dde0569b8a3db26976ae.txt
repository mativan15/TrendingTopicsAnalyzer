Amazon is facing a $1bn (£889m) lawsuit in the UK over claims it abused its dominant position by favouring its own products.The case is being brought by consumer rights advocate Julie Hunter, and her lawyers said it centres on "a secretive and self-favouring algorithm" used by the tech giant to promote its own products through the "buy box" feature on its website.
Items selected for Amazon's "buy box" are more visible to shoppers and, therefore, have a head-start in achieving sales, said the lawsuit.
