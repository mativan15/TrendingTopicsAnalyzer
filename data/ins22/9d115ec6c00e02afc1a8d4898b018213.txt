A letter addressed to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, alleging that a TMC Youth Congress general secretary collected Rs 7 lakh each from 44 candidates in the teacher recruitment scam, was seized by the Enforcement Directorate from TMC MLA Manik Bhattacharya's premises in August, the central agency has said in its submission to a special CBI court.
This is the first time that a court submission by the central agency in the teacher recruitment scam has mentioned the Chief Minister. The ED submission to the court, made on Monday, doesn't mention the date of the letter, the name of the person who allegedly wrote it or the TMC Youth Congress general secretary who allegedly collected the money.
