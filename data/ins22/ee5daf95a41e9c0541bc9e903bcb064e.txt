It can be worth paying down a mortgage as borrowers with more equity in their property may also be able to secure a better rate when they come to remortgage.  
Pete Matthew, an adviser at Jacksons Wealth Management, said investing any spare cash versus paying a mortgage was riskier but more likely to be financially worthwhile.
The average fund whose remit is to invest up to 60pc of its money in stocks has returned 6.9pc over the past five years. But this figure was depressed by plummeting returns during the pandemic, said Mr Matthew.
