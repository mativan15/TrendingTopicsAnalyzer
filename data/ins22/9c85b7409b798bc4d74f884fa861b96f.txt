Punjab Congress will stage a protest demonstration at Khatkar Kalan, the ancestral place of Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh, on October 21 to press for the removal of cabinet minister Fauja Singh Sarari over the alleged extortion plan audio clip. PCC president Amarinder Singh Raja Warring and Congress Legislative Party leader Partap Singh Bajwa said that this was shameful on part of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Punjab that despite having an open and shut case against Sarari, he was being allowed to continue as a minister in the government, while it was targeting its political opponents on flimsy grounds.
