(Bloomberg) -- The judge who will decide Steve Bannon's sentence for contempt of Congress suggested that the political adviser hadn't shown remorse for his actions.Bannon, 68, had argued the offense level should be lowered because he accepted responsibility. But US District Court Judge Carl Nichols disagreed and said at the sentencing hearing Friday that Bannon 'expressed no remorse for his actions' and he has yet to show an intention to comply with the subpoena.The government is asking that Bannon be sentenced to six months in prison and pay a $200,000 fine.
