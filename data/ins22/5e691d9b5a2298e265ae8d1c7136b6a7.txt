It's no wonder. In today's low-inventory market, homes are receiving multiple offers and oftentimes selling for over list price; 60% of sellers report getting at least two offers on their home2, and nearly half of all homes sold in the U.S. in April 2022 went for over the asking price, up from 37% a year ago.

Additionally, some buyers planning to finance their purchase with a home loan are losing out to others who are able to pay entirely in cash, which is seen as a more attractive offer to a seller, since they don't need to worry about the sale falling through in the financing stage.
