EVEN AS medical postgraduate (PG) aspirants are waiting for the second round of admissions in Maharashtra, there is no clarity on the number of seats that will be available in Round Two.
A significant chunk is reserved under the ‘in-service doctors quota' and there is no update yet on the 400 seats excluded by the Maharashtra Common Entrance Test (CET) cell at the last minute owing to lack of necessary permissions.
After getting no relief from the Bombay High Court on their petition against the 'untimely' implementation of the in-service doctors quota by the Maharashtra government, students said they don't know if the excess seats under the quota will be included in the total seats for Round Two.
