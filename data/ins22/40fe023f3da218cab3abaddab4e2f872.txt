People walk with their masks on at a platform in Gwanghwamun Station in Jongno District, central Seoul, on Friday. [NEWS1] The government will look into partially easing its indoor mask mandate after reviewing expert opinions, the Ministry of Health and Welfare said Friday. If eased, people will be required to wear masks in fewer indoor settings, such as on public transportation and in medical facilities. "We will actively look into cases abroad where they require wearing masks indoors only in places like hospitals, public transportation and social welfare institutions," Health Minister Cho Kyoo-hong said during a parliamentary audit hearing on Thursday.
