KristinBy KristinJun 3, 2022Forgotten subscriptions could be costing you a lot of money on services and things you're not using anymore.   I was looking through a credit card statement recently and I saw an insurance plan that I bought for an old cell phone that I didn't even own anymore. That was $8.99 a month so I cancelled it. And my husband had a Game Fly video game membership that he hadn't used in close to a year. Another $17.99 a month, so that went away too.   Those little amounts can really add up, in fact a new study found that on average, consumers actually spend about $133 more than they thought they did on monthly subscriptions.
