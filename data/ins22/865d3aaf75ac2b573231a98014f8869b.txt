Hundreds of Yale affiliates gathered in Woolsey Hall on Saturday for a day-long program to celebrate the opening of the new Jackson School of Global Affairs, Yale's first new professional school in more than four decades.

The school — which opened its doors on July 1 and welcomed its first cohort of graduate students this fall — trains and equips new generations of leaders to devise thoughtful, evidence-based solutions for challenging global problems. Before becoming a stand-alone professional school, it was known as the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs.
