The Washington Commanders are without starting quarterback Carson Wentz for the next 4-6 weeks after he fractured a finger on his throwing hand in last week's win over the Chicago Bears.
With Washington at 2-4, fans may think the competitive portion of the season is over. However, despite being two games from third place in the NFC East, the Commanders remain only one game behind for the final wild-card berth.

Therefore, it was an easy decision for head coach Ron Rivera to roll with Taylor Heinicke as the quarterback in Wentz's absence instead of rookie Sam Howell.
