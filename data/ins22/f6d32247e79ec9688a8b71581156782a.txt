A new app featuring content from pundits across the political spectrum is launching, and its founders say it will fill a gap they see in the audio media world.

CenterClips will allow users to hear 30-second to five-minute audio posts from creators on the right and left weighing in on the latest news and current events, according to an announcement exclusively shared with The Hill.

CenterClips' founders Quinn Cotter and Lauren Williams said the app is breaking ground in two areas — offering a new type of online platform for audio media and a new way for the public to interact with the pundits they see online and hear on TV.
