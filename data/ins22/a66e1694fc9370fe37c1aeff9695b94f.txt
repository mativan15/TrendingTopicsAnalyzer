BOSTON–The Philadelphia 76ers brought in PJ Tucker in order to promote accountability and bring in somebody who will push the team in the right direction in terms of toughness and being able to provide the two-way ability to the floor.
He provided that leadership and accountability in the opener despite the Sixers falling to the Boston Celtics 126-117. Tucker pulled Tyrese Maxey to the side late in the first half and the two of them had a conversation, a little spat if one will, and Tucker was directing Maxey out on the floor.
