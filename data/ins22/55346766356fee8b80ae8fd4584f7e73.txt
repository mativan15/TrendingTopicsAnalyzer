The Orlando Magic's lone non-NBA TV nationally-televised game will now air on Bally Sports Florida.

The NBA announced Wednesday afternoon that the Magic's road game against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Nov. 1 has been added to Bally Sports' schedule after previously being selected as a national exclusive to TNT.

Magic-Thunder was supposed to feature the top picks in June's NBA draft in Orlando's Paolo Banchero and OKC's Chet Holmgren but Holmgren has been ruled out for the season after suffering a Lisfranc injury to his right foot during the summer.
