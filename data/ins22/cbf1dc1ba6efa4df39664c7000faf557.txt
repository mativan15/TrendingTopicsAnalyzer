IN ENGLAND there was once a gold coin called the guinea. Its value was twenty-one shillings ($3), or just over a pound. The coin has disappeared, but the word has remained. The guinea is, in fact, the fashionable unit of currency. It is used to indicate the price of such luxuries as mink coats, Canaletto views of Venice, and laryngologists'consultations. The rents of flats and houses are generally measured in guineas, too. In some cases this is a matter of fashion, but more often it is a crafty way of adding 5 per cent to the price in pounds.
