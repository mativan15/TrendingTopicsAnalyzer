The ruling party aims for annual coal production to rise to 4.6 billion tons in 2025, a deputy director of the Cabinet's National Energy Administration, Ren Jingdong, said at a news conference held during a ruling party congress. That would be a 12% increase over last year's 4.1 billion tons.

Ensuring an adequate power supply is especially sensitive after economic growth slid to 2.2% over a year earlier in the first six months of this year, less than half the official target of 5.5%. The ruling party earlier called for this year's production to rise by 300 million tons, or about 7% of last year's output.
