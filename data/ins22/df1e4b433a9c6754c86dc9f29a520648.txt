What was proposed: Four months after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012, legislation was proposed by Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania to expand background checks for commercial gun sales, including at gun shows and on the internet.What happened: The proposal fell five votes short in the Senate and went no further. The Senate, then led by Democrats, also defeated measures to ban assault weapons and high-capacity gun magazines.
