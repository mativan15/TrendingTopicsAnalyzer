NEW DELHI: India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp plans to take a stake in the new Russian entity that will manage the Sakhalin 1 project in the far east as it seeks to retain a 20% share in the asset, three sources familiar with the matter said.Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month issued a decree to establish a new operator for the ExxonMobil -led project and authorised the Kremlin to decide whether foreign shareholders could retain stakes in Sakhalin 1." ONGC Videsh will protect its share in the project, which means it will take a stake in the new entity," said one of the sources.
