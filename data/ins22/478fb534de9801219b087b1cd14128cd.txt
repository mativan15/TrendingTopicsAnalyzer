DETROIT — Detroit Red Wings forward Jakub Vrana has entered the player assistance program of the NHL and NHL Players' Association.

The league and the union made the announcement. They did not specify why he entered the program.

Vrana will be paid while he is receiving treatment. The program administrators will determine when he's cleared to compete for the Red Wings.

The 26-year-old Vrana had a goal and an assist in a win at New Jersey. Two days later, the team said he did not play in a home game against the Los Angeles Kings due to personal reasons.
