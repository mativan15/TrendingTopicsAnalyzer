BRITS look set to be given more money for using energy outside of peak hours after the National Grid ESO raised the discount it will offer. 
The discount for avoiding using energy during off-peak hours has been increased from 52p per kilowatt hour to £3, meaning households that use their washing machine at night could make typical savings of £100 this winter.
The news comes as the electricity system operator warned Brits could face three-hour blackouts during the coldest days of the year.
Fintan Slye, the director of National Grid ESO, wrote in The Guardian, businesses and homes "can become virtual power plants and, crucially, get paid like one too".
