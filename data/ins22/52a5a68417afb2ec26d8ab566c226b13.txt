ICON Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:ICLR) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 15% in the last month. While that's not great, the returns over five years have been decent. The share price is up 53%, which is better than the market return of 48%. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 37% drop, in the last year.

In light of the stock dropping 6.8% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return.
