Tesla CEO Elon Musk gave his executive employees an ultimatum in an email yesterday: Return to the office full time, or leave the company.A leaked email from Musk began circulating on Twitter today with the subject line reading 'Remote work is no longer acceptble [sic].' The email—posted by Sam Nissim—was sent to 'ExecStaff' on May 31, and explains that executive employees must be in Tesla's office for a minimum of 40 hours per week. Any remote work must be done outside those hours. 'This is less than we ask of factory workers,' the email reads, and Musk says that if full time in-office work isn't possible for 'particularly exceptional contributors,' then he will personally vet their situations and offer any approval accordingly.
