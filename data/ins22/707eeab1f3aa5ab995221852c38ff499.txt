A day after Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain's arrest, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called the case filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) 'completely fake and fraud' and said that Jain was targetted due to 'political reasons'.
'I have personally read Satyendra Jain's case filed by the ED and it is completely fake. All the actions that have been taken by centrally maintained agencies are politically motivated. And in this case, also Jain has been targeted because of political reasons. We have a very honest government, which neither tolerates nor does corruption.
