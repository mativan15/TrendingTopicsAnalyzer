MUNICH and MÜLHEIM-KÄRLICH, Germany, May 31, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- TOMRA continues to play a key role in closing the loop on PET beverage containers but recognizes that there is more to be done. Now political framework, bold decisions and smart investments in collecting, sorting and recycling should be used to improve circularity across all material streams and to overcome today's supply chain bottlenecks.
"We have an obligation to work with all stakeholders to reduce the mountains of waste and transform them into the valuable resources they are", TOMRA's CEO and President Tove Andersen stated at TOMRA's press conference held at IFAT.
