What if you could sign up to live your entire life in a simulated reality created by an experience machine? This forms the premise of Bengaluru-based artist Vishnu Ravindran Nair's latest single ‘Pleasure Machine'. While the original idea was only a thought experiment suggested by philosopher Robert Nozick in 1974, in Nair's track, the choice to participate in an actual experiment of this kind is made feasible. How? The idea is that the subject's brain can be stimulated in such a way that it induces exclusively pleasurable experiences.
