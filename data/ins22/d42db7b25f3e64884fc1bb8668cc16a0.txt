Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez told a House of Commons committee Friday that he would be open to amendments on a bill he says would make Canada a world leader in supporting a modern free press.Bill C-18 would require tech giants to negotiate deals to pay media outlets in order to make their news content available on major online platforms. It wouldn't affect any deals that the companies have already made with journalism outfits."It's about the future of journalism in our country," Rodriguez said.
