Dozens of Apple workers in Australia walked off the job Tuesday after negotiations over pay and working conditions stalled, the latest crack in the armour of the tech giant as it contends with a burgeoning unionization movement in the United States and Europe. The action itself is small. About 150 retail workers, out of the company's nearly 4,000 Australian employees, voted to strike for an hour. Then, starting Wednesday, they will refuse to do a variety of work, including installing screen protectors, repairing AirPods and handling deliveries.
