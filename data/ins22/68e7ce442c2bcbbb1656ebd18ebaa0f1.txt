Chimichurri is a traditional Argentinian condiment that goes beautifully with all sorts of things. It's particularly lovely with grilled meat since its acidity plays so nicely with charred flavors and cuts through fat. It also adds a bright herbaceous flavor that's welcome on everything from grilled vegetables to burgers. Is this recipe traditional? No, it is not. But this version is easy to make and a go-to condiment that will happily live in your fridge for at least a week. Stir it into mayonnaise, rub it on grilled chicken, and dollop it on grilled mushrooms.
