As the number of privacy regulations worldwide continues to grow, organizations should focus on five privacy trends to help meet the challenges of protecting personal data and meeting regulatory requirements, according to Gartner, Inc.

'By year-end 2024, Gartner predicts that 75% of the world's population will have its personal data covered under modern privacy regulations. This regulatory evolution has been the dominant catalyst for the operationalization of privacy,' said Nader Henein, VP Analyst at Gartner.
