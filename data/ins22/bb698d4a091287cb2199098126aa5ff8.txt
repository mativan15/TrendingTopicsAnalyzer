Ms Braverman declined to return calls on Thursday. If she runs, Steve Baker, the Northern Ireland Office minister, is expected to take a leading role in her campaign.
One MP ally of Ms Braverman said: "Suella recognises that maybe it's for her to support rather than to go for it herself.
"But if there is no decent candidate on the Right then maybe she will go for it. A lot of the older ERG-ers will be telling her to run. If Boris Johnson does go in to bat, it would be hard to see Suella not backing him.
