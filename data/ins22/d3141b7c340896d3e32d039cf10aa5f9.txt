Jasmine Shah, vice-chairperson of the Delhi Dialogue and Development Commission, a government think tank, was served a notice on Monday for allegedly using a public office for political activities, which amount to misuse of public resources, according to a document seen by HT. The notice was served over 30 days after Parvesh Sahib Singh, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from West Delhi, lodged a complaint with Delhi lieutenant governor (LG) VK Saxena, alleging that Shah was using his office for political activities like attending political debates on TV on behalf of the ruling Aam Aadmi Party.
