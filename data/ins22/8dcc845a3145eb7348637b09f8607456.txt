It's not too bad having legendary investor Warren Buffett as your largest shareholder, hinted HP CEO Enrique Lores, though the vote of confidence isn't likely to sway how the business is run.

"First of all, he and Berkshire are one of the most reputable investors in the world, and we welcome them to HP," Lores said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). "But we are going to continue to manage the company as we have done until now. Our focus is on long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. This is what we have done, and this is what we are going to continue to do going forward.
