When 14-year-old Molly Russell died in 2017, her father spent countless hours scouring his daughter's social media trying to understand why she took her life.

A few days after her death, he found an email in Molly's inbox from Pinterest, a social media and image-sharing platform.

It suggested his daughter suicide-themed messages, like an image of a girl self-harming captioned, 'I can't tell you how many times I wish I was dead'.

Ian Russell says he was 'shocked' to see Molly had received messages such as '10 depression pins you might like".
