Th chip giant Broadcom announced last week plans to acquire the software maker VMware in a deal valued at $61 billion. While ownership changes aren't new for the virtualization-software leader VMware, which has changed hands several times over the past two decades and was most recently spun off from Dell, not all of its customers are sold on the deal.Some customers of the two tech giants told Insider they're cautiously optimistic, as Broadcom could introduce an influx of resources. But others said Broadcom and VMware may start competing in their respective product areas.
