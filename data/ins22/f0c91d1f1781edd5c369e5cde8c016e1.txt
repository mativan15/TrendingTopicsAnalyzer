By Australian Associated Press Published: 02:45 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 02:45 EDT, 19 October 2022 A receipt for computer hardware purchased by a South Australian public servant read "fake receipt to keep Pro Master happy", a corruption watchdog investigation has found. The Independent Commission Against Corruption prepared a report examining allegations that two public officers at the Department for Infrastructure and Transport misused their government purchase cards. Over the course of about three years, the officers allegedly charged almost $400,000 to their cards and while most purchases were deemed legitimate, close to 10 per cent could not be accounted for.
