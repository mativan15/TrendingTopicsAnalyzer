Sundry Photography Since I wrote my most recent cautious note about Nutanix Inc. (NASDAQ:NTNX), the shares are up about 54% against a loss of about 11% for the S&P 500. This outperformance was the result of a couple of stock price "pops" on the back of takeover rumours. I thought I'd review the name yet again to see if it would be worth buying based on these rumours. I'll review the most recent financial performance, and I'll look at the stock as a thing distinct from the underlying business. This recent price action may vindicate some of the analysts with whom I've disagreed with for so long, and who have been so wrong to date.
