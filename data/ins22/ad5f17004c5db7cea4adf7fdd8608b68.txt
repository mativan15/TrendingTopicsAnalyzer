With "slight or modest" economic growth , inflation still at 40-year highs and a slowdown in hiring , the market could be heading for a period of stagflation, and investors should look to defensive stocks to protect their portfolios, according to Jefferies. Investors have been concerned that a recession may be on the horizon, though stagflation is more likely, Jefferies global head of microstrategy Desh Peramunetilleke said in a recent note. Stagflation is marked by a combination of high inflation along with stagnant economic growth.
