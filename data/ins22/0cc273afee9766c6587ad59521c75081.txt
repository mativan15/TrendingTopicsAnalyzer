Gemma Collins is never one to do things by halves, and Halloween is no exception.
The Only Way Is Essex star, 41, is clearly getting into the spooky season as she decked out her mansion with tons of decorations, from spiders to skeletons and everything in between.
Gemma, who bought her Essex mansion – dubbed the Buckingham Palace of Essex – for £1.3 million in January last year, has turned her home into the ultimate haunted house.
She took to Instagram this week where she gave fans a front-row look at the transformation, excitedly writing: ‘Happy weekend 🎃 to all my peeps witchy or non witchy 🎃 im ready for the SPOOKY 👻 shenanigans 👻.
