Mallikarjun Kharge and Shashi Tharoor (File photo)Congress presidential candidate Shashi Tharoor's team has taken up with the party's central election authority chairman the issue of a directive asking PCC delegates to mark "1" against the name of their choice on the ballot paper that has Mallikarjun Kharge on serial number '1' and Tharoor on '2', sources said on Sunday. After Tharoor's team flagged this issue, party's central election authority chairman Madhusudan Mistry is said to have conveyed to them that now a tick would be accepted against the name of the preferred candidate instead of '1', the sources said.
