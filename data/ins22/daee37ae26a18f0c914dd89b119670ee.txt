Here are the companies making headlines before the bell:

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) – Johnson & Johnson shares rose 1.4% in the premarket after beating top and bottom line estimates for the third quarter, helped by growth in pharmaceutical sales. J&J did narrow its earnings outlook, as it maintains caution due to the impact of a strong U.S. dollar.

Hasbro (HAS) – The toymaker reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.42 per share, falling 10 cents shy of Street forecasts, with revenue matching estimates.
