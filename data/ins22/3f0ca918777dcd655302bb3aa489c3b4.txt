A year later, she points to her swearing in ceremony as the high point of that first year.Following Naheed Nenshi's 11 years in the mayor's chair, Gondek promised to bring a different style of leadership from that of her predecessor.It's a style she describes as more collaborative and less focused on her as the mayor.
