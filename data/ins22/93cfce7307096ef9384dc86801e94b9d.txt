The Wrap Universal/Blumhouse's 'Halloween Ends' is shaping up to have a frontloaded run at the box office, opening below expectations with a 41.2 million launch from 3,901 theaters.Independent trackers had expected this reboot trilogy finale to at least match the 49.4 million opening of its 2021 predecessor, 'Halloween Kills.' Not only has it fallen short financially, it's also getting weaker audience reception than 'Kills' with a C+ on CinemaScore and Rotten Tomatoes scores of 40 critics and 56 audience.
