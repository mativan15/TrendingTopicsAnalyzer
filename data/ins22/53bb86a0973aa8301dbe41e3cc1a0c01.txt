Deutsche Bank has been raided for the second time in less than a month, this time over a $1tn greenwashing scandal that has rocked the bank.Regulators in Germany claim that DWS, the bank's asset management arm, sold investment products worth $1tn as more environmentally friendly and 'sustainable' than they actually were.
The former DWS head of sustainability blew the whistle on the asset manager last year, saying it would often overstate the success of its environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy.
