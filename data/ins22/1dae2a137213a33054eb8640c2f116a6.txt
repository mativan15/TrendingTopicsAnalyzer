The legislation would prohibit Amazon and similar platforms from giving preference to their own products and unfairly limiting availability of competing products on their platforms. The bill, which currently stands before the U.S. Senate, receives bipartisan support, and although the idea of regulating Big Tech is slightly less popular with Americans than it was last year, more Americans support it than don't, according to Pew Research.Not surprisingly, Amazon is not among the bill's supporters. The Seattle e-commerce giant on Wednesday published a blog post urging senators to reconsider the proposed legislation.
