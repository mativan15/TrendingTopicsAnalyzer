N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) — Chadian security forces opened fire on anti-government demonstrators in the country's two largest cities Thursday killing at least 60 people, the government spokesman and a morgue official said.
Authorities imposed a curfew after the violence, which came amid demonstrations in the central African nation against interim leader Mahamat Idriss Deby's two-year extension of power.
Chadian government spokesman Aziz Mahamat Saleh said 30 people were dead in the capital, N'Djamena.
