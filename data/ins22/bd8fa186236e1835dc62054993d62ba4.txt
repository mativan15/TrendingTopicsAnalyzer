Eric (played by Chris Chittell) was left aghast earlier this week on Emmerdale when he discovered David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) was going to propose to Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins). Although the ITV soap stalwart warned his son against it, the shopkeeper still went ahead and did it, leaving him mortified when he realised it was not what his partner wanted and his father was right. Despite having a little tiff about the whole engagement, it seems the pair will have to work together in upcoming scenes as a secret is revealed.
