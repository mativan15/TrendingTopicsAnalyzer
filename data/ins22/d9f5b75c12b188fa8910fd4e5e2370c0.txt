Bruce Bennett/Getty Images News Allstate (NYSE:ALL) stock has tanked 12% in early Thursday trading after the insurer preannounced late Wednesday some Q3 results showing that the insurer is having a hard time keeping up with the rate of inflation. The insurer expects to post a Q3 adjusted net loss of $400M-$450M, impacted by a $875M charge for unfavorable prior-year reserve reestimates, excluding catastrophes. In addition, catastrophe losses are estimated at $763M, pretax, for the quarter. Allstate (ALL) said the reserve adjustment for personal auto insurance totaled $643M, primarily from bodily injury coverages.
