A global semiconductor shortage is likely to wane by late 2022 into early 2023, but growing demand for chips in every industry underscores the need for diversification in the supply chain and increased U.S. production, said the Qualcomm CEO.

A nationwide shortage of semiconductors is wreaking havoc for several industries, from automobiles to healthcare, and the White House has warned of "escalating vulnerabilities" due to the shortage.

"One thing we determined is chips are important… chips are going to be an essential ingredient when we think of our economic growth, chips are going everywhere," Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told Fox Business on Thursday.
