The holiday season is just around the corner, which means 2022's biggest and most exciting video games are about to drop. Compared to past console generations, the video game industry now does a slightly better job spreading major releases throughout the entire year. Still, publishers tend to save their biggest blockbusters for October, November, and December to capitalize on the shopping rush. 2022 is no different.
