They are supposed to be the golden years, but new research has highlighted the difficult reality Māori face heading into retirement. A set of four papers released by Te Ara Ahunga Ora Retirement Commission have revealed the widespread social and economic disparities Māori face during retirement. The in-depth research found the impacts of colonisation, land theft and inequality had caused ongoing hardship for tangata whenua in their later years. One of the papers described how lower life expectancy meant kaumātua received NZ Superannuation for fewer years compared to their non-Māori counterparts.
