UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations said on the eve of Thursday's expiration of a two-month truce in Yemen that it has received "preliminary, positive indications" from the warring parties about extending the nationwide cessation of hostilities. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Wednesday that Hans Grundberg, the U.N. envoy for Yemen, "is involved in intense work on ensuring the renewal of the truce." Yemen's internationally recognized government and Iran-backed Houthi rebels accepted the U.N.
