Brendan Fraser is apologizing for causing a major traffic disaster in San Francisco while filming "George of the Jungle" 25 years ago.Fraser, who starred in the 1997 film, recalled filming a scene along the Bay Bridge that caused chaos. He spoke at the Mill Valley Film Festival in California on Thursday and explained that although a dummy was used for the scene, drivers on the bridge believed a real person was in despair."Disney put a mannequin hanging by a parachute from the uprights. It brought traffic to a standstill on either side of the bridge," he told SFGate.
