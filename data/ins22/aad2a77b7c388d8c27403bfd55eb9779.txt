Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN) stock surged 17% postmarket on Wednesday after the meal kit firm launched a new offering on Walmart.com (WMT) to drive customer growth.
Starting Wednesday, shoppers can buy a selection of meal kits without a subscription. The meal kits will be directly fulfilled by APRN.
APRN is the first and only meal-kit provider on the Walmart Marketplace platform, which serves millions of monthly active shoppers.
APRN is offering four meal kits that serve up to 12, with plans to expand the options available on the platform in the coming months.
