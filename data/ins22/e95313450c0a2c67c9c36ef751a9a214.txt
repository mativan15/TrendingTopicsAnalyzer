Cryptocurrencies remain volatile, but Coinbase is among the best-positioned exchanges to ride out the storm and come out on top, Cowen said. "Coinbase represents a pure-play on the increasingly broad-based and nascent cryptoeconomy," wrote analyst Stephen Glagola in a note to clients Thursday. "We think this is a company that is built to last through the vagaries of crypto asset cycles." Glagola initiated coverage of the cryptocurrency trading and investing platform with an outperform rating, noting strengths in Coinbase's subscription and services platform.
