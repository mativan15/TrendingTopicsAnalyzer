Amazon faces a UK class-action lawsuit over claims that the tech group uses a 'secretive' algorithm to abuse its dominant position in the online marketplace.                 Amazon has made millions of customers pay more by hiding better deals on its website and mobile app to boost its own products, Hausfeld, alleges the law firm behind the case. It does this by using a 'secretive and self-favouring algorithm' in its Buy Box feature.       Britain's opt-out class-action regime finally sparked into life last year after new laws allowed US-style claims under competition law.
