Shares of Piedmont Lithium Inc. PLL, +8.03% charged up 9.3% in midday trading Wednesday, after the lithium producer announced a $141.7 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy. The company said the grant is part of the Biden administration's infrastructure law aimed at expanding domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and for materials currently imported. Piedmont, which has yet to report any revenue, said the grant will support the construction of its $600 million Tennessee Lithium project, which is expected to begin in 2023, and to produce 30,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide per year.
