More retail traders are taking a page from the pros by investing in leveraged and inverse funds. The most active exchange-traded fund on retail trading platform Webull is the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ, in terms of the number of shares changing hands.Proshares routinely sees $5 billion in notional trade each day. The boost in trading volume of leveraged and inverse ETFs like SQQQ and its opposite TQQQ, has led to the Nasdaq-indexed ETFs outpacing the S&P 500 in the second quarter of 2022.Webull CEO Anthony Denier said retail investors are embracing leverage to make up for their accounts being downgraded, and they are not able to qualify for leverage in terms on margin.
