Published: 10:01 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 10:10 EDT, 19 October 2022 Meghan Markle has hit back at her controversial interview with New York Magazine's The Cut, claiming that she was too 'trusting and open' with the writer to whom she once again slated the royal family - while heavily hinting that the chat was never meant to address her feelings about the monarchy. The 41-year-old spoke out about the bitter backlash over the August cover interview in yet another magazine cover shoot, this time with Variety, which features a near-identical shot of Meghan on its front page to the one that was featured by The Cut two months ago.
