Everton boss Frank Lampard has stressed the need for managers to be given time following his former England team-mate Steven Gerrard's sacking at Aston Villa.

Gerrard, who had been in charge at Villa since November last year, was dismissed by the club on Thursday after a 3-0 defeat at Fulham left them 17th in the Premier League.

Speaking at his press conference ahead of Saturday's home game with Crystal Palace, Lampard described Gerrard as someone he has 'a huge amount of respect for as a player, a person, a manager, a coach', and 'a very tough lad'.
