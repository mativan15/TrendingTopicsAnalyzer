Oct. 16—The Space Foundation Discovery Center turned 10 years old this month, and the Colorado Springs community was invited to celebrate its birthday on Saturday.

Visitors were treated to a demonstration from Penrose-based model-rocketry company Estes Rockets, food truck, 3D printed prizes, an exhibition from the Manitou Robotics Team and a host of other displays and games as the Discovery Center celebrated a decade of impact on the Colorado Springs area.

"The Space Foundation has been hugely important in Colorado Springs, nationally and even internationally," said Nicole Sjoblom, Estes' education and outreach specialist.
