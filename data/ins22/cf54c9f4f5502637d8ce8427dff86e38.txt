Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the National Education Policy (NEP 2020) will pull the country out of slave mentality and asked people to 'teach a lesson' to those who constantly 'abuse and insult' Gujarat, without naming any political party. The Prime Minister, who addressed multiple events in his home state on Wednesday when he started his two-day visit, also said aeroplanes will be manufactured in Gujarat.Launching a ‘Mission School of Excellence' to upgrade 20,000 government schools at Adalaj in Gandhinagar district, Modi said knowledge of English was considered mark of intellectualism even though it was a medium of communication.
