(RTTNews) - Growth in U.S. service sector activity slowed by slightly more than expected in the month of May, the Institute for Supply Management revealed in a report released on Friday. The ISM said its services PMI dipped to 55.9 in May from 57.1 in April, although a reading above 50 still indicates growth in the sector. Economists had expected the index to edge down to 56.4. With the bigger than expected decrease, the services PMI dropped to its lowest level since a matching reading in February of 2021.
