A married mom's eagerness to bring a close female friend on a long-awaited family trip abroad with her teenage daughter has sparked speculation she could be having an affair.According to a Reddit post written by a user claiming to be the teen, her mom previously promised to take her on a special trip to Japan once she graduated from high school. However, those plans were updated to include Erin, her mom's close friend whom she became "really close to" during the pandemic."My mom goes over there two to three times a week to spend the night at her house," the teen wrote.
