The Denver Broncos did it to us again.
For the second week in a row Russell Wilson and his teammates went on national TV and proceeded to play one of the worst, most boring football games that you'll ever. It was painful. It cringe-inducing. It was bad for everyone's health – both physically and mentally.
Seriously, last night's game against the Chargers (who 'won' 19-16 in OT) was somehow just as bad (if not worse!) as the Broncos' Thursday Night Football game against the Colts the week before, and that game was the definition of disgusting.
