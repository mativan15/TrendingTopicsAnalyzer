Apple's second-generation AirPods are available from Amazon, Walmart, and Target for just $99.99 — a $20 discount from their usual $120 price tag at those stores. That's also $30 off Apple's usual pricing of $129. This is not the absolute best discount we've seen for the second-gen AirPods. Towards the end of 2021, we saw them go down to only $89.99. However, it's unlikely that these AirPods will get a better deal until a big sales event hits, like Amazon's Prime Day in July. The second-gen AirPods are the basic model that comes with a wired charging case rather than the wireless charging case you'd find on the third-gen AirPods and AirPods Pro.
