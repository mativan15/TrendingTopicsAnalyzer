Cars.com Inc. (NYSE:CARS) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 16% in the last month.

You would have done a lot better buying an index fund, since the stock has dropped 48% in that half decade.

On a more encouraging note the company has added US$54m to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the five-year loss for shareholders.
