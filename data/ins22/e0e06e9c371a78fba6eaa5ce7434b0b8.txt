HOUSTON — Aaron Judge ran up the first base line with his bat in his right hand in the eighth inning Thursday night, hoping more than believing he'd finally broken through. The Yankees slugger watched as the fly ball he hit 106 miles an hour off the bat died in the wind of an unusually opened roof at Minute Maid Park.

This is a place where the Yankees' league-leading offense has come to die. Again. Framber Valdez was brilliant, but the Bombers offense struggled for the second-straight night Thursday as the Astros beat the Yankees 3-2 in Game 2 of the American League Championship Series.
