Freddy Fright Fest is terrifying ticketholders at Fredericton Capital Exhibit Centre for the next 10 days. The APEGNB and Paramedic Association fundraiser has scared up its biggest event yet. "To create the haunted tour, I'd say we've had 60 to 100 people in here working and building,' said Bill Lamey, chair of Freddy Fright Fest. 'It's a real community event; all these different organizations come together. It's not just one entity that creates this.' It takes 47 people to operate the haunted tour on a nightly basis and a lot of teamwork to get it up and running.
