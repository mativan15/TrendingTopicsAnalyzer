Stephanie claims she had to quit selling her flatulence due to a heart attack scare, so she came up with another plan to make money! 'If boob sweat is the new side hustle, I'm here for it,' Matto said in an interview. 'It's going to be a hot girl summer, and my boobs are sweating, so let's bottle it and sell it!' If the weather is warm enough, she is able to produce enough perspiration to fill 10 bottles, which are sold for $500 a pop on her X-rated site, Unfiltrd.
