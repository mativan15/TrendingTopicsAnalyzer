There's something comical about the New York Yankees being in an underdog role. Their payroll this season was nearly $265 million, the third highest in the league behind only the New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers. They have 27 World Series championships. No other team has more than 11 rings. The Yankees and underdogs don't belong in the same sentence.

The Yankees looked like they were on their way to setting regular season records in the first half of the season. Things didn't turn out that way.
