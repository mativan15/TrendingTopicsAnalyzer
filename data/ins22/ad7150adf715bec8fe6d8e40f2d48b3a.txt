The Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services will audit the Food and Drug Administration's decision to close an Abbott Nutrition plant, which has contributed to the nationwide shortage of baby formula. "We will determine whether FDA followed the inspections and recall process for infant formula in accordance with Federal requirements," the HHS Inspector General said Thursday. The Abbott Nutrition plant in Sturgis, Michigan, was temporarily shut down in February and several brands of powdered formula were recalled after four infants contracted bacterial infections, leading to hospitalizations and two deaths.
