A travel commentator, Nick Trend, claimed that "many people are distinctly rusty when it comes to the basics of travel", suggesting that passengers are "contributing" to the problems. He said that issues such as not having boarding passes ready, failing to put liquids into plastic bags and forgetting to take laptops out at security "all adds to the general sense of chaos and only makes the situation worse." This comes as holidaymakers have been faced with waves of flight cancellations and long queues at airports.
