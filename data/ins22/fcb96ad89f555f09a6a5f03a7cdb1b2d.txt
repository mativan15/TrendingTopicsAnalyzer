By Australian Associated Press Published: 16:45 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 00:56 EDT, 18 October 2022 Treasurer Jim Chalmers has downplayed expectations of cost of living relief in next week's federal budget, warning some measures could push inflation even higher. Dr Chalmers noted the cost of living could surge due to devastating floods in NSW, Victoria and Tasmania pushing up the price of some groceries. Preliminary talks have already been held with Treasury about the economic impact of the floods.
