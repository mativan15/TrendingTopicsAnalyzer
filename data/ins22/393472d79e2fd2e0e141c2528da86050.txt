CLEVELAND — Jameson Taillon will get the ball first Monday night with the Yankees' season on the line.
After Gerrit Cole extended it on Sunday night in Game 4 of the ALDS, with a strong seven-inning effort in a 4-2 win over the Guardians at Progressive Field, Taillon will start Game 5 for the Yankees back in The Bronx.
Taillon will likely be the first in a parade of arms the Yankees could use to try to punch their ticket to the ALCS. The Yankees had the right-hander as a relief option for the first two games of the ALDS before seemingly holding him back in Games 3 and 4 so he could be available for Monday's decisive Game 5.
