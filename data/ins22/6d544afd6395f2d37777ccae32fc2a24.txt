Given the likely global recession, small businesses are reaching for new kinds of financing. Thus, the Buy Now Pay Later business model is now expanding into this B2B world at a rate of knots. Playter has raised backing to do this, as has Hokodo, Billie and Tranch, to name a few other players. But in Germany, B2B Payments company Mondu has emerged as a significant entrant to the market.

Mondu has now raised a $43M Series A round led by US-based venture capital fund Valar Ventures, and will use the funding to expand into more European countries later this year.
