Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp will reportedly take legal action having been accused of xenophobia against Manchester City's owners.

Klopp made comments on Friday about the relative spending power of his side compared with rival clubs and later insisted that he had been 'misunderstood'.

The Reds boss was accused of lighting the touch paper ahead of the high-octane 1-0 win over City on Sunday which saw him shown a red card, coins thrown at Pep Guardiola, the City bus damaged and City fans engaging in chants about the Hillsborough disaster.
