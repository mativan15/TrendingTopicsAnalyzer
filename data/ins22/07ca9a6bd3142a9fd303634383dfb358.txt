The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has for the third time extended the deadline for debt-ridden Reliance Capital's resolution process to January 31. The earlier deadline was November 1, 2022. This is the third extension as the timeline has been extended twice in the past, sources said. As per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) rules, the administrator had to originally close the resolution of RCL within 180 days, by June 3, 2022. 
Earlier, the lenders of Reliance Capital had given an extension of 30 days to the bidders for submission of binding bids, along with an EMD of Rs 75 crore, by October 31.
