(Reuters) -U.S. stock index futures extended gains on Monday on better-than-expected results from Bank of America, with investors scanning the latest batch of earnings for impact of decades-high inflation and rising interest rates on corporate profit.

Bank of America Corp rose 3% in premarket trading as the lender benefited from higher net interest income in its third quarter, even though it added $378 million to its loan-loss reserves as it braces for a weakening economy.
