Cast aside following the signing of Edouard Mendy, the Spanish international is the only player to have appeared in every single minute of action since Potter's appointment last month, establishing himself as one of the early key players under the former Brighton manager.The 28-year-old has been in fine form in recent weeks, denying Ivan Toney a number of times during Wednesday night's draw away at Brentford, as well producing a string of fantastic saves in the win at Aston Villa.Chelsea were previously open to the player's exit after a fall from grace for the world's most expensive goalkeeper but his comeback has been perhaps the headline of Potter's tenure so far.
