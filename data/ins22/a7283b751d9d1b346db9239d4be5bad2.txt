I bought tickets for Genesis's The Last Domino tour at the O2 in London last year but because of Covid it was postponed twice.After it was rescheduled a second time I decided to sell my tickets as for health reasons it was going to be difficult for me to go.I sold the tickets through the official seller AXS and was told the money would go into my nominated PayPal account within 10 working days of the concert happening. That was in March. Now it is two months later and I still have no cash.I have emailed and emailed (there is no number to call).
