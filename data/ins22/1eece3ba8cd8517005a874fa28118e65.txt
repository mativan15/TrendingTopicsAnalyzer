(Bloomberg) -- Ken Griffin's trading empire is growing its European footprint at a ferocious pace.  Since the start of 2019, hedge fund Citadel and market maker Citadel Securities have doubled their combined headcount in the region to roughly 750, according to a spokesman. That makes it one of the region's most significant recruiters in the world of asset management and trading in recent years. The expansion comes as money managers compete furiously to hire top trading talent. Rival investment firms from Millennium Management to BlueCrest Capital Management are bolstering teams as they look to take advantage of the return of volatility across asset classes.
