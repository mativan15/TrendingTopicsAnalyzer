The pageant will begin at 2.30pm at the Horse Guards Parade, along Whitehall to Admiralty Arch, down The Mall to Buckingham Palace, before returning via Birdcage walk. 
The procession is set to take two and half hours, concluding at around 5pm. The pageant is free and open to the public, meaning those hoping to catch a glimpse can head to one of the viewing areas on route.
There will also be large TV screens at Whitehall and The Mall, as well as St James' Park to follow the events. Three special displays marking significant occasions in the Queen's reign – the Accession, the Coronation and Jubilees – will be staged at the official royal residences from July 2022.
