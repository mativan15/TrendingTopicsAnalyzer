Asos (ASC.L) has posted an 89% drop in 2021-22 profits and forecast a first half loss in its new financial year, as consumers cut spending during the cost of living crisis.

The online fashion retailer posted a pre-tax loss of £32m ($28m) from a profit of £177m and said trading at the start of the new fiscal year had been volatile.

On an adjusted basis profits fell to £22m in the 12 months to August 31 2022, in line with recently lowered guidance and down from £193.
