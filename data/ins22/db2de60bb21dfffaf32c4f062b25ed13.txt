The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) carried out 'search and seizure' at 16 entities including offices of Axis Mutual Fund, stock brokers and individuals as part of the ongoing probe into suspected wrongdoings by two former fund managers of Axis MF, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The capital markets regulator's searches for evidence were done at 30 locations across various cities and towns in Maharashtra and Gujarat, the person said. In the past few weeks, Sebi has been receiving alerts from its internal surveillance alert system and inputs from National Stock Exchange about suspected front-running of trades at Axis Mutual Fund, the person said.
