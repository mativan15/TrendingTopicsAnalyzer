October 18, 2022 06:53 PM Eastern Daylight Time SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dalrada Financial Corporation (OTCQB: DFCO, 'Dalrada,' the 'Company') announced today a delay in the filing of its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.

While the Company has allocated significant resources to finalizing its audited and consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, it was unable to file Form 10-K prior to the extended October 14, 2022 due date.

Several new business units acquired and established throughout the past fiscal year, particularly with regard to Dalrada's fast-growing energy services division and life sciences units, required additional time to phase in, consolidate and complete a comprehensive review of the financial statements included on Form 10-K, to ensure an accurate annual report.
