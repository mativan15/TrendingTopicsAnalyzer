Play Time is the name given to a new partnership between the player's Messi Group and Silicon Valley executives Razmig Hovaghimian and Special Advisor Michael Marquez. 
Headquartered in San Francisco, the Messi Group said Play Time will be a holding company and act as the main vehicle for Messi's investments in sports, media, and technology investments globally.
