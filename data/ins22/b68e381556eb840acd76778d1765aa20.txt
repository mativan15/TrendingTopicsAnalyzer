Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shone a spotlight on loopholes in UK political donations rules which must be closed to block foreign influence, the Electoral Commission's chief says.
John Pullinger, the chairman of the Electoral Commission, the country's independent elections agency, voices his concerns in an article for The Telegraph, which you can read in full below.
Mr Pullinger writes that there are not enough safeguards in place for the public to have confidence that 'unlawful' foreign money is not influencing the British politics.
