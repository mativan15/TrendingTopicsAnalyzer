Ticketing platform SeatGeek and black-check firm RedBall Acquisition Corp. decided to terminate their $1.35 billion take-public deal amid a roller-coaster market. The move was a result of current unfavorable market conditions, particularly impacting growth technology companies, according to SeatGeek and the SPAC backed by Billy Beane of the Oakland Athletics as well as Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant. "Given the volatility in the public markets, together, we determined that a termination of the business combination was in the best interest of all parties," SeatGeek CEO and co-founder Jack Groetzinger said in a statement.
