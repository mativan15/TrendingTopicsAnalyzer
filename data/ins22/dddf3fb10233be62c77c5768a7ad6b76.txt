State-owned insurance behemoth LIC is expected to recover its Rs 21,624 crore investment it had made in IDBI Bank as share prices are likely to rebound to 2019 levels by the time the lender is privatised, an official said. The official said that since the commencement of the IDBI Bank privatisation process in May last year, the share price has jumped from Rs 35 a share to Rs 45 a piece currently. "We are expecting IDBI Bank scrip to move up further. The price is expected to move up closer to the price at which LIC had picked up stake in 2019," the official told PTI.
