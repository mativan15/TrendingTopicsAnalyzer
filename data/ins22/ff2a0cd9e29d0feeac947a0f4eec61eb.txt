BHUBANESWAR: The November 3 Dhamnagar by-election provides an opportunity to the BJD and the BJP to set the tone for the 2024 elections even though the outcome will have no bearing on the Naveen Patnaik government or the opposition.Having failed to retain the Balasore seat in the bypoll in November 2020, which was held following the death of MLA Madan Mohan Dutta , the BJP is desperate to retain Dhamnagar. Party general secretary and Odisha in-charge Sunil Bansal is closely monitoring the situation at the micro-level.
