By Australian Associated Press Published: 01:56 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 01:56 EDT, 21 October 2022 Farmers struggling after years of drought and floods could save millions of dollars in farm costs if NSW allowed controversial virtual fences to be set up on rural properties, a state MP says. Orange MP Philip Donato on Friday called on state agriculture minister Dugald Sanders to reform animal welfare legislation to permit "virtual stock fencing", which is banned due to animal cruelty concerns.
