AGL Energy's board will meet on Monday and is expected to ditch the plan to split its operations, surrendering to a campaign by billionaire climate activist Mike Cannon-Brookes to foil the move.Neither AGL, Australia's biggest electricity generator, nor Cannon-Brookes would comment on the meeting, but bankers and consultants briefed some media outlets over the weekend that the demerger would be scrapped.One insider told Guardian Australia that the board itself and management roles were 'up in the air', and it appeared Cannon-Brookes had succeeded, at least for now.
