A 5-year-old Utah boy is recovering after he was attacked by a dog while riding his bike to his friend's home.
 
Mason Mihlberger's mother and father heard his screams, then ran outside and saw a husky mauling their young son on Wednesday near their home in Sandy, KSL-TV reports.
 
After the attack, Mason was taken to the hospital by helicopter, according to KSL-TV, where he received between 2,000 and 3,000 stitches on his face and ear in addition to a skin graft.
 
"If me and my husband weren't there, my son would be dead right now," Mason's mother Tori Mihlberger told the outlet.
