Zimbabwe are appearing at their first global tournament since 2016Zimbabwe coach Dave Houghton is wary of a backlash from West Indies when the sides meet in their T20 World Cup first round group game on Wednesday.The Africans know a win would put them on the brink of a place in the Super 12 - a result which would effectively eliminate the West Indies."I expect the West Indies to come fighting and bouncing back in the next game," Houghton told BBC Sport Africa."They've got some very, very good players, they play a lot more T20 cricket than we do and they've just come off the Caribbean Premier League as well.
