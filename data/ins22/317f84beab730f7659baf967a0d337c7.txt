Compassion drives one to go beyond the call of duty and touch lives. One such passionate doctor in Chhattisgarh's Barsur has won hearts online as he goes above and beyond to help pregnant women using technology, that too by spending money from his own pocket.
Dr Ganesh Babu, who has been practising as a medical officer at the Brasur Primary Health Centre, was deeply concerned over the low number of childbirths happening in hospitals in the area and decided to gift basic feature phones to women in the region.
