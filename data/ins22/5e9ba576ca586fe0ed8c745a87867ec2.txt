If you didn't already know Honey was owned by PayPal, you will now. The payments giant will announce on Monday plans to combine the cash-back perks of several of its offerings into one system, called PayPal Rewards. The new tool will allow customers to pool cash-back rewards earned from their various products: the PayPal app, PayPal Honey, and, in the future, PayPal's Cashback Mastercard and PayPal's debit card. Venmo — the mobile payment app especially popular among Gen Z and Millenials — is also owned by PayPal, but is noticeably not included in the new integration.
