Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, has agreed to buy Parler, a social media platform that has been embraced by conservatives who departed Twitter over allegations of political censorship. Parlement Technologies, the company behind Parler, announced Monday that it has entered into an agreement in principle to sell the social media platform to Ye for an undisclosed amount, while continuing to offer technical support such as cloud services.  The decision by Ye to buy his own social media platform comes at a time when the biggest tech firms are struggling with how to control and manage some of their largest users.
