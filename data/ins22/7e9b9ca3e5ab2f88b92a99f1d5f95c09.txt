The topics of critical race theory and diversity have exploded in the public arena, causing further divide in our society between conservatives and liberals. I am not here to justify either point of view. As an immigrant, I just want to share my experience of our rich diversity. We are indeed a divided country, but as a people, I am amazed at the ability of so many Americans to find ways of coming together. The diversity of America is what has always made it a "promised land" for so many. I want to share a positive reminder of the best this great nation can be.
