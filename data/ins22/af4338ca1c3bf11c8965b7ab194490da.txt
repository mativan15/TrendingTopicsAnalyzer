Drew Angerer/Getty Images News Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) said on Thursday that a Phase 3 trial for its arthritis therapy Orencia did not reach the primary endpoint with statistical significance in adults hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. The Phase 3 ACTIV-1 trial was designed to evaluate if the immune modulator, also known as abatacept, could speed up recovery and reduce death versus placebo in combination with standard of care among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. According to topline data, Orencia demonstrated a stronger response compared to placebo.
