The famous Pushkar fair in Rajasthan's Ajmer district, which attracts thousands of tourists, will be held without the cattle fest this year owing to the spread of lumpy disease in the state.
Sub-divisional magistrate (Pushkar) Sukhram Pindel said, 'Cattle fair will not be held this year due to the lumpy disease outbreak. Apart from this, all other religious and cultural events will be held. Preparations for the fair are going on full swing.' Cattle trading remains a key highlight of the colourful and vibrant fair which is held annually in the holy month of Kartik in Pushkar town, around 150 km away from the state capital.
