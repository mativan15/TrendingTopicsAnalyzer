Alex Murdaugh waited an hour to phone 911 after shooting his wife and son dead and was caught on camera at the murder scene, according to bombshell new evidence that prosecutors say will seal his guilt. Murdaugh is accused of murdering his wife Maggie and son Paul at the family's home in South Carolina last June. He is preparing for trial, and is also facing 80  separate charges for allegedly stealing millions of dollars from his own law firm and from the family of his late housekeeper, Gloria Satterfield.
