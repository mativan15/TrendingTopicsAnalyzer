Lower Hutt's Event Cinema is reopening, six years after being demolished following the Kaikōura earthquake. The opening will coincide with the release of James Cameron's Avatar: The Way of the Water, which is due to open on December 16. The cinema, which is part of the Queensgate Mall complex was the highest profile casualty of the earthquake in Lower Hutt, which forced the temporary closure of the mall.
