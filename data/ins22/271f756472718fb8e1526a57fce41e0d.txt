Will Interpol become the new sheriff of the metaverse? One thing is certain: it does not want to fall behind.

The global police organisation has just unveiled what it calls 'the first-ever metaverse specifically designed for law enforcement worldwide'.

It says the move will help police forces across the world 'interact with other officers via their avatars' and even take 'immersive training courses in forensic investigation and other policing capabilities'.

'The metaverse has the potential to transform every aspect of our daily lives with enormous implications for law enforcement,' Madan Oberoi, Interpol's Executive Director of Technology and Innovation, said in a statement.
