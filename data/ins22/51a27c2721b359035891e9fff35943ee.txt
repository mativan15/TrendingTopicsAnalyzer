Joe Biden has warned that if Republicans win control of Congress in the midterm elections they would 'explode the deficit' and 'crash the economy' with their plans for more tax cuts and a showdown over the debt limit.At the White House on Friday, the US president said that Republican leadership in Congress 'has made it clear they will crash the economy next year by threatening the full faith and credit of the United States', by seeking cuts to social security and Medicare, the largest government pension and healthcare programmes for seniors, in exchange for a debt-limit increase.
