Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.

Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I'm Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off for a holiday in the U.K.)
