Dean Saunders feels Liverpool must do all they can to keep Sadio Mane at the club as his departure could significantly hinder their progress.

Mane, 30, was part of the Reds side beaten 1-0 by Real Madrid in Saturday's Champions League final. But the bombshell then dropped the following day that he is looking to leave the club this summer. There has been no official word from the Senegal star himself.

But renowned transfer specialist Fabrizio Romano tweeted on Sunday that the forward is ‘ready for a new experience'.
