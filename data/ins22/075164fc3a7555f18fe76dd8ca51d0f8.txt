BBC Media Action conducted a midline survey in two provinces of Zambia to gauge the reach of media outputs (radio programmes and PSAs) and understand how audiences think about the issues addressed by them. We found regular listeners reporting more progressive attitudes and less support for violence.
Context
Gender based violence (GBV) is widespread in Zambia. According to the 2018 Zambian Demographic and Health Survey, 21% of 15-19-year-old women and 34% of 20-24-year-old women have experienced physical violence after age 15.
