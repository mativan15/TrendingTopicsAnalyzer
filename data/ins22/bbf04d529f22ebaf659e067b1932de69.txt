Dave Kennedy will serve a second five-year term as vice president for alumni engagement and development, President Vincent Price announced this week.
The reappointment followed a routine administrative review that was conducted by a committee chaired by Bill Boulding, dean of the Fuqua School of Business. Kennedy's new term begins July 1, 2023.
'Under Dave's leadership, Duke is engaging our global network of over 190,000 alumni and friends, harnessing their extraordinary talents, and securing philanthropic support that is enabling us to strengthen our educational, research, and patient care missions and advance strategic priorities,' said Price.
