If you recognized one of the necklaces auctioned at this year's amfAR Gala Cannes, it might be because it had a grand debut at another megawatt benefit fundraiser: The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Benefit. At the Met Gala, it was looped around the neck of Lauren Remington Platt but last Thursday, it was worn by Indya Moore onstage at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Cap d'Antibes, enticing bidders to raise their paddles to fundraise for amfAR's foundation for AIDS research.Sculpted in 18k white gold and Palladium alloy, the semi-enclosed neckpiece, when worn, appears as though a shooting star is traveling around your neck.
