Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated's (NASDAQ:VRTX) price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 23.5x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 13x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Vertex Pharmaceuticals has been doing relatively well.
