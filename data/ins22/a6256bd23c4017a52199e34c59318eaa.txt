Former Love Island star Kaila Troy is getting rich from OnlyFans - despite being told the saucy platform could kill her career. The 28-year-old crashed landed into Casa Amor midway through last year's series to start her man hunt. But she was brutally dumped from the island just three days after flying out, even after building a close bond with Teddy Soares. When she got home she made a big decision, even though she was urged not to. She told the DailyStar she has now made enough money through the racy app that she could easily quit her job as a DJ if she wanted to.
