With just two weeks left to play in Super Netball's home and away season, the competition has reportedly sold the rights for its 2022 Grand Final to Perth Arena.Ever since the national netball league was established in 1997, the winning team of the major semi-final has been awarded the right to host the decider – bar the last two years, when it had to be played in Queensland due to COVID restrictions.Although Netball Australia and CEO Kelly Ryan are yet to confirm or deny the news, electing to stay silent on the issue on Wednesday, sources say the national sporting body is exploring its options – with News Corp reporting several different states have been bidding to hold the event.
