Gaming retailer GameStop's net loss more than doubled in the first quarter, compared to a year ago, but CEO Matt Furlong says the company is winning in the metrics that matter most. Primary among those, Furlong said is top-line growth. GameStop's net sales were $1.378 billion for the quarter, up from $1.277 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Furlong emphasized, as he has in previous earnings calls, that the company considers long-term revenue growth the best indicator that its turnaround strategy is working, and main way stockholders should measure the company's performance.
