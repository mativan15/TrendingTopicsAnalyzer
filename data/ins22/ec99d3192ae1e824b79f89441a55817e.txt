On the first day of June it feels like a good time to check in on recruiting rankings nationally to see where teams fall as they try and build their 2023 recruiting classes.  It's still early as evidenced by the fact that Alabama has just four players currently committed in their 2023 class, but the foundation for these classes are being poured.For instance, of Alabama's four commitments there are three ranked as four-star talents and the other is a five-star.  The Tide have a long way to go but that helps explain how despite having such a low number of commitments they're viewed as the 29th best class to date.
