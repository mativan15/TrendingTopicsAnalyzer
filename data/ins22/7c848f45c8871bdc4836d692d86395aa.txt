'I made a mistake signing too long with my last contract ... and if it was all about money, I would have left ages ago,' Haas said on Monday after entering NSW camp.Per NRL rules, Haas is unable to sign with any rival club until November 1, 2023, with Broncos officials privately confident they will be able to find middle ground when contract talks do eventually resume.That said, Brisbane have also insisted behind closed doors that their salary cap cannot accommodate a million-dollar front-rower.The club baulked at matching the seven-figure asking price for Haas's schoolboy teammate David Fifita when the Titans came calling two years ago and is still smarting from the repercussions of long-term, lucrative deals for Matt Lodge, Tevita Pangai jnr and Anthony Milford.
