On Friday in the Los Angeles Lakers' final preseason game, head coach Darvin Ham did something many fans have been pining for going back several months: bring Russell Westbrook off the bench.
The move had mixed results, as he had no points, two assists and two turnovers in five minutes before he left the contest with a bad hamstring.
Ham made it clear he would use the preseason and even some of the regular season to experiment with lineups.
According to him, Westbrook handled the move to the bench with a good attitude, and the coach also made it clear that the former league MVP could end up back in the starting lineup.
