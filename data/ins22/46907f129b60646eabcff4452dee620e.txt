Erik ten Hag has been criticised for 'disrespecting' Cristiano Ronaldo again, by another one of CR7's former Manchester United teammates.

Ronaldo failed to find a suitor this summer having made it clear to United that he wanted to leave the club, turning up to preseason far later than the rest of the squad.

The Portugal international has since been used sporadically by Ten Hag, with the Dutch boss insisting he needed time to get back to full fitness.
