On the evening of May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd, sending millions of people to the streets in protest of racial inequality. Within 72 hours, the tech industry also began to respond. By June 2020, more than 200 tech companies had made formal statements about Floyd. They promised changes such as investing in equity and justice focused organizations, improving diversity training, and hiring more Black talent.Despite the initial rapid response, now that two years have passed since Floyd's murder, annual reports and other public companies' documents tell a story of some lip service to change without much real action, according to interviews with a dozen of current and former Black tech employees, racial equity experts and DEI professionals.
