La Liga president Javier Tebas said on Tuesday the Spanish league will send its formal complaint to UEFA in 'one or two days' regarding Kylian Mbappe's new contract at Paris Saint-Germain. Tebas said it was 'impossible there has not been cheating', referring to UEFA's financial fair play rules, and that La Liga "is not going to allow a European club to destroy the ecosystem of European football." Mbappe rejected Real Madrid to sign a new three-year deal at PSG last week, prompting Tebas to say the agreement was an 'insult to football' given the French club's financial losses.
