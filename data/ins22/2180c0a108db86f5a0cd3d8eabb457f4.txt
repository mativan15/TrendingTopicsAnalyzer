Tata Play (formerly Tata Sky) has decided to offer its over-the-top (OTT) service Tata Play Binge to non-Tata Play users, two years after its initial launch. The aggregator app, which now has tieups with 25 VOD services, including the likes of Disney+Hotstar, MX Player, ZEE5, Voot, SonyLIV, Hoichoi, Planet Marathi, Sun NXT, and Eros Now, will be available for all smartphone users, with no pre-requisite of needing a DTH subscription. 
So far, since its launch in 2020, the app has been available only to Tata Play subscribers and has around one million paid subscribers, said Harit Nagpal, MD & CEO, Tata Play.
