India has grown tremendously over the years in agriculture. The country has managed to become food self-sufficient. As agriculture has become one of the most profit-making businesses in the world, there still exists the biggest challenge of food shortage across the globe.
With global population rising massively, it is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050. Now, the food industry is posed with a challenge to make ends meet. More than 27% of the global workforce is employed in agriculture and India has about 152 million people working in the agriculture sector as of FY 2021.
