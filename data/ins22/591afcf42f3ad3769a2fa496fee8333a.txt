Despite the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) sealing the Mahanagar underground parking lot a few months ago, it was being run by local goons, who were collecting huge sums from people using the parking lot.On Sunday evening that racket came to an end following a surprise inspection by additional municipal commissioner Pankaj Singh, who was shocked by the large number of vehicles parked inside the lot without the knowledge of the LMC. A named FIR was lodged against three people for the illegal operation of the lot.
