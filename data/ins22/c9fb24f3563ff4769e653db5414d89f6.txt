REUTERS/Brendan McDermidOct 17 (Reuters) - Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) Chief Financial Officer Anne Bramman will step down in December, the U.S. upscale retailer said on Monday, a month after the company adopted a "poison pill" to prevent investors from amassing 10% or more of its shares.Poison pills make a takeover more expensive or difficult by allowing existing shareholders to buy shares at a discount, diluting a suitor's ownership stake.
