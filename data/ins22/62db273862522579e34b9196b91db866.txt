Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation has made special arrangements for ensuring uninterrupted power supply to Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital and its Multispeciality Hospital during the ensuing northeast monsoon.Since these facilities cater to the needs of thousands of poor patients from Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Thoothukudi, Kanniyakumari and Virudhunagar districts, they need power supply round the clock to take care of patients undergoing treatment, particularly those kept in intensive care units.
