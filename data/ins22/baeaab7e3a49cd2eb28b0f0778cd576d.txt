Transport Minister Michael Wood has hit out at protesters who on Tuesday disrupted Wellington traffic for a fourth time in less than two weeks. Wood said the actions of protesters who forced the closure of the Mt Victoria Tunnel by lowering a banner into rush-hour traffic was 'stupid'. 'These activities just, I think alienate people from the issue, and they're extremely dangerous,' he said.
