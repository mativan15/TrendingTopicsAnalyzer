A half-joking, half-serious Brendan Fraser issued an apology to the entire city of San Francisco for his 1997 film George of the Jungle, particularly one scene shot on the Bay Bridge.

At the Mill Valley Film Festival in California on Oct. 13, Fraser recalled the sequence in which his Tarzan-like George climbs atop the bridge to rescue a tangled parachuter. The production halted traffic at the time and may have led some local newscasters to believe the incident was real.
