During Donald Trump's presidency, Trump hotels charged the Secret Service nightly rates as high as $1,185 per room, more than five times the recommended government rate, and the high rates continued after he left office, according to an investigation released Monday by House Committee on Oversight and Reform.Beginning in 2017 through Sept. 15, 2021, the Secret Service received at least 40 waivers to let it spend more than the recommended per diem rates to stay at Trump properties to protect Trump as a president, as a former president and to protect those around him, the investigation found.
