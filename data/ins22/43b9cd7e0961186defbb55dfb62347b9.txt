British and US intelligence says the Iranian Revolutionary Guard is on the ground in Crimea, supporting Russian drone attacks on Ukraine.
America's National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Iran had sent personnel to assist Vladimir Putin's troops in launching Iranian-made drones on Ukraine's power stations and other key infrastructure.
This includes members of a branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps - one of the most powerful paramilitary organisations in the Middle East - according to UK government reports.
