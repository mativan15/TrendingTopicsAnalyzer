The 'convincing' scam comes in the form of a text which claims to be from Evri - the delivery company which has recently changed its name from Hermes. Fraud experts have highlighted a text message asking for around £1.45 to have a parcel delivery - which may seem innocuous as it is a small fee.However, this could well be a precursor to a person handing over valuable personal information, which could be devastating for their finances.Ryan Beeley, a solicitor and fraud expert manager at CEL Solicitors, warned of the dangers of this kind of scam.
