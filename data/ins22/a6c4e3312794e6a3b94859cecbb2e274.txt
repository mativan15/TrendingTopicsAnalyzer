Mining billionaire Andrew Forrest's court case against Facebook parent Meta will proceed after overcoming an argument about legal jurisdiction.

Lawyers for the tech giant made their first appearance in Perth Magistrate's Court on Tuesday and conceded the court had jurisdiction, clearing the way for criminal proceedings over alleged clickbait advertising to go ahead.

Forrest, the founder of iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group, alleges the social media giant was criminally reckless in allowing bogus advertisements using his image to appear on its site.
