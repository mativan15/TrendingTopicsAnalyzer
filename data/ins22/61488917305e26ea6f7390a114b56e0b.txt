Five years ago, Darrold and Marty Glanville used a $150,000 loan from the Small Business Administration to buy a mill and other equipment to expand their North Branch, Minn., company, Sunrise Flour Mill. The couple started the business after retiring from careers in manufacturing and teaching. By the time they reached out for SBA help, the business already had restaurants buying the flours they make from organic, heritage wheat. Today, they sell various flours, pastas and baking mixes to stores and online to consumers in every state.
