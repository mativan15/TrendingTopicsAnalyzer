When W. SOMERSET MAUGH AM was asked to select and edit the ten best novels in world literature, he thought at once of Balzac. Dickens, Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky; then the choice became difficult. Finally he chose three novels from France, two from Russia, one from America, and four from England, and for each book he wrote an introduction. His appraisal of Flaubert's Madame Bovary we printed in November, his essay on Fielding and Tom Jones in December; in January he discussed Balzac, and Le Père Goriot, and in February the Brontës and Wuthering Heights.
