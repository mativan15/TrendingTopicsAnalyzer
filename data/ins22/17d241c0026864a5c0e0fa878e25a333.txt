Ofgem has warned energy companies overcharging customers on their direct debits that they will be forced to repay the money.

The energy bill price cap increased by 54% on 1 April, adding £693 to the typical household bill.

However, a growing number of customers have since reported that their payments have increased by more than the energy price cap allows.
