After a miserable end to a turbulent season, the last thing the Brooklyn Nets seemed to need was star player Kevin Durant trying to force his way out of the organisation. But teammate Kyrie Irving believes the off-court drama has brought the Nets closer together and improved their chances of success as they go in pursuit of an elusive NBA title. Brooklyn made a losing start to the season on Wednesday, being routed 130-108 by the New Orleans Pelicans at Barclays Centre, but there is optimism that they will come good over the weeks and months ahead with Ben Simmons healthy again and Durant back on board after flirting with the exit door in the summer.
