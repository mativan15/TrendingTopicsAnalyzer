The Scottish Olympian Ross Murdoch has warned that a generation of young athletes could be 'shut out' of sport by rising costs hitting clubs and families.The swimmer, a Commonwealth Games, World and European Championships gold medal winner who represented Team GB at both the 2016 and 2020 Olympic Games, spoke out as a survey of community sports organisations revealed deep concern over their ability to deliver grassroots sessions in communities across Scotland.In research for charity Sported, four out of five groups said they expect kids to be forced out of taking part in activities — even free sessions — because their families are struggling to cover the basics.
