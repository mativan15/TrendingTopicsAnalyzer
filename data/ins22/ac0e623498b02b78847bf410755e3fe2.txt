Wachiwit Investment thesis I cover Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) extensively, with many articles on the company's fundamentals and valuations, which can be found here. I continue to like the company as the investment case continues to look compelling: As highlighted before, I thought that the problems that Garena and Free Fire are facing are short-term ones. As evident from the recent Free Fire trends, we can see that the business is stabilising in its key markets. I continue to take the view that Garena will continue to operate as a market leader and play a key and pivotal role in the development of the other segments of Sea as it continues to generate strong cash flows for the business.
