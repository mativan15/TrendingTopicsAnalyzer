The best way to invest in this market may be to go small, according to Morgan Stanley. The firm said in a note Thursday that it sees small-cap stocks outperforming their large-cap counterparts going forward. Strategist Michelle Weaver said small caps have seen their earnings multiples fall sharply when compared to large-cap stocks, adding that the earnings revision breadth for smaller names seems to have bottomed. "Our base case remains that the recent strength in equities will prove to be another bear market rally in the end," she said.
