Daniel Berehulak Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE), one of the leading space flight companies in the world, has seen its share price come under immense pressures as of late as a result of some operational setbacks, competitive pressures and subsequent analyst downgrades. Investment banks came in droves after the company announced it was pushing back its first commercial space flight from the first quarter of 2023 to the second quarter, downgrading the stock to a "sell" rating. This, alongside the actual operation setback, has resulted in the company's share price closing at its lowest since the company's IPO.
