Julian Edelman is at it again in the world of sports betting.
No, he isn't dropping another $100,000 on a Super Bowl bet involving the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but the retired receiver did reveal he placed a bet on the Patriots to upset the Cleveland Browns on the road on Sunday.

He also talked about rookie quarterback Bailey Zappe, who could potentially be making his second straight start under center.
Zappe helped the Patriots knock off the Detroit Lions in Week 5, and he nearly led them to a win over the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field, as a replacement for injured backup Brian Hoyer.
