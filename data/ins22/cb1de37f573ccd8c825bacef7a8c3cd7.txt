Oct. 16—No one said it was going to be easy.

A day after a memorable comeback effort that saw the Guardians score three runs in the bottom of the ninth inning to take a 6-5 win over the Yankees for a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five American League Divisional Series, the Yankees have taken back the momentum and advantage.

Led by Gerrit Cole's magnificent start, going seven effective innings, New York won Game 4, 4-2, at Progressive Field on Oct. 16.

That sends the teams back to New York for a winner-take-all Game 5 on Oct.
