Columbus is once again on the hunt for a chief diversity officer, as Damita Brown plans to leave her government job for a new role in the nonprofit sector, according to a news release.

Brown's last day with the city is Nov. 1. After that, she will serve as chief diversity officer of National Church Residences, a Columbus-based senior living developer.

In 2021, Brown replaced Beverly Stallings-Johnson, who herself held the role for just over a year. Stallings-Johnson left the city to lead diversity efforts at Dublin-based Wendy's.
