Eight months after 914 private data entry operators (DEOs) were hired to man the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) and other police services, the Delhi Police Crime Branch has registered an FIR against the firm that provided the manpower. This comes after police received a complaint from the vigilance branch alleging that the firm had charged Rs 25,000 per applicant for the job.
A senior police officer said the vigilance branch investigated the allegations after one of the applicants, a resident of Burari, approached the Crime Branch.
