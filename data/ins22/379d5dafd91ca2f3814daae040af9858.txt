The jury is now deliberating in the federal trial of Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill.

Hill is accused of violating the civil rights of jail inmates by putting them in a restraint chair for hours.

Attorneys made their closing arguments on Friday before handing the case over to the jury just before noon.

The defense argued that Hill was doing his job by keeping his jail and his staff safe, but the government said the sheriff violated his own policy and the law.

Prosecutor Brent Gray said none of the seven detainees in this case displayed violent or uncontrollable behavior at the time they were placed in the restraint chair.
