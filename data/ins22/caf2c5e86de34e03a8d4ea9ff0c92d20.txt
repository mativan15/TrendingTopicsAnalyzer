The Bobby Bones ShowBy Bobby Bones ShowJun 2, 2022It's always an interesting day on The Bobby Bones Show when the studio knows an Employee of the Month is being awarded. Everyone gets their acceptance speeches prepared and then one by one, Bobby Bones knocks off a person who isn't being crowned the winner. In recent months, Eddie, phone screener Abby, and Lunchbox have won. Today (June 2), Bobby Bones crowned the Employee of the Month for April with the help of Mike D and Scuba Steve. It came down to Lunchbox and Morgan at the very end.
