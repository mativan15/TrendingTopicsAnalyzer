Syracuse is 6-0 for the first time since 1987 but faces a distinctive step up in competition at Clemson . The Orange's marquee wins, such as they are, have come against Purdue and North Carolina State, which trotted out a backup quarterback last weekend after starter Devin Leary was lost for the season with an injury. Still, Orange Coach Dino Babers has managed to keep things close with the Tigers during his tenure. In 2017, a Syracuse team that would finish 4-8 shocked a Clemson team that was bound for the College Football Playoff, and two of the last four games between the programs have ended with single-digit Tigers wins.
