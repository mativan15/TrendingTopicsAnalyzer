LeArchitecto/iStock via Getty Images Shareholders of Studio City International Holdings (NYSE:MSC +63.3%) were big winners on Tuesday. Shares of the Hong Kong-based casino operator surged over 90% at intraday highs as investors eyed the reopening of its flagship Cotai, Macau casino and resort. While gains moderated toward Tuesday's close, the gain was nonetheless remarkable and recouped essentially all of the stock's steep losses for the month of May. The outsized move in shares dovetails with broader moves for Macau-linked casino stocks in light of declining COVID cases across China.
