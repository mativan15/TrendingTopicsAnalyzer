Chandigarh: Rival parties in Punjab have slammed the Aam Aadmi Party government over its alleged failure to follow rules and due procedures in the appointment of vice-chancellors. Their reaction came in the wake of Governor Banwarilal Purohit asking Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann to remove Satbir Singh Gosal as the vice chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), dubbing his appointment "totally illegal". "By now, this government should have realised that administrative appointments, unlike Rajya Sabha nominations, are not made through royal edicts, but under a proper procedure after following rules and regulations," Punjab Congress president Amrinder Singh Raja Warring said in a statement.
