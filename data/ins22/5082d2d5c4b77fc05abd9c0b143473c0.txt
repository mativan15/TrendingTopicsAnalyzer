When the COVID-19 pandemic slammed the U.S. in March 2020, and for months afterwards, Black people were at least three times more likely to die of COVID-19 than their white peers — but now white Americans are consistently more likely to die from the disease, The Washington Post reported Wednesday, based on its in-depth, age-adjusted analysis of federal COVID-19 death data from April 2020 through last summer.

The Black-white mortality gap narrowed and widened, then first flipped in October 2021, the Post found.
