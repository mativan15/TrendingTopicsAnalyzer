Hot Girl Summer came and went, but if you love a seasonal theme, you're in luck; according to Twitter account @joshcarlosjosh's viral tweet, Cozy Boy Fall has officially claimed the cooler weather, pushing oversized sweaters and roomy trousers to the forefront of our wardrobes (precisely where they belong).

The polar opposite of Hot Girl Summer, Cozy Boy Fall involves packing up your bodycon tanks and hip-hugging bottoms and saying buh-bye to risque cutouts.
