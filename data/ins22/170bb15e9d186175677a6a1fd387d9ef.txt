A key government witness from Elizabeth Holmes's fraud trial told a judge he stands by his testimony, which will likely doom the request for a new trial she filed after the former Theranos Inc. lab director showed up at the startup founder's home in August and allegedly expressed remorse about her conviction.

Adam Rosendorff was asked by the judge handling the case at a hearing Monday if he testified honestly at the trial.
