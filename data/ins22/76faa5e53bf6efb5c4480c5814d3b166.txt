A group that works with union pension funds is pressing Hyundai Motor Co. to respond to reports of child labor at U.S. parts suppliers, warning of potential reputational damage to the Korean automaker. SOC Investment Group, which works with union pension funds that have more than $250 billion in assets, sent a sharply worded letter on Wednesday to company chairman Euisun Chung, saying investors were concerned in the wake of a July investigation by Reuters that found child labor at a Hyundai subsidiary in Alabama.
