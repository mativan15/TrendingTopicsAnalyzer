Oct. 19—Even though I'm a summer guy at heart, I don't have a good argument for the people who say this is the best time of the year.

The Covered Bridge Festival has pretty much a full-fledged leaf display this fall — which hasn't always been the case recently — and if the people working the stands had to wear a couple of extra layers early this week, I'm sure they came prepared for that. The cider place down the stairs at Mansfield — is it still there? It's been a couple of years since I've been — might be serving the mulled variety, but by the end of the week it should be cider slush again.
