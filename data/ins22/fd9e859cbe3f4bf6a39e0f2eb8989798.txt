Firearm components recovered in a Metropolitan Police raid this week represent a known issue, one expert said, which is becoming problematic. On Wednesday, October 12, officers seized components from a makeshift firearms factory in North London made using a 3D printer, with pictures showing grey plastic parts. The Met said the seizure was "one of the largest" ever conducted in the UK, and it marks a growing problem in the UK.Met Commander Paul Brogden said the components "could be used to create weapons", and investigators believed the firearms "were being manufactured to sell".
