World No.4 Minjee Lee has praised the US Women's Open organisers for putting on the most lucrative event in women's golf history.

Lee will be one of five Australians lining up at North Carolina's Pine Needles, including Hannah Green, where a record $US1.8 million ($2.5m) will be on the line for the winner as part of a total prize pool of $US10 million ($14m), up from $US5.5 million in 2021.

'I think we're always talking about prize increases and anything to elevate the women's game

even higher,' Lee said.
