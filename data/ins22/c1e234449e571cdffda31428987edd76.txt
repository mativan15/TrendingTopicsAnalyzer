It used to be a beauty salon but now the property the salon once sat on looks like a landfill.

DeKalb County Code Enforcement has been citing the property owner for the last three years, but nothing has changed.

Willy Mitchell runs a title business along Old Wesley Chapel Road in Decatur.

Every time he comes to work, Mitchell told Channel 2′s Tyisha Fernandes that he has to look at the mounds of trash and debris on the property next door.

Those mounds of trash include furniture, appliances, shopping carts and food scattered across the property.
