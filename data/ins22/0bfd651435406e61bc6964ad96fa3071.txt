Biotech stocks reversed course along with the broader market and closed the week ending June 3 lower. The sector's lean run thus got extended. Genocea Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GNCA), which announced on May 24 plans to wind down of operations, continued to see weakness, ending the week down over 66%. The company is awaiting delisting of its stock from Nasdaq. Aeglea Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AGLE) shares also came under intense selling pressure after it announced the Food and Drug Administration's decision to issue a refusal-to-file letter for its Arginase 1 deficiency treatment candidate.
