Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor, will make a statement today, bringing forward measures from the medium-term fiscal plan that will support fiscal sustainability.
Mr Hunt will announce tax and spending measures two weeks earlier than scheduled, the finance ministry said as he tries to turn around a loss of confidence in the Government's fiscal plans.
He will also make a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon.
The new Chancellor has promised to win back the UK's economic credibility by fully accounting for the Government's tax and spending plans, while insisting that Liz Truss, the Prime Minister, remains in charge of the country.
