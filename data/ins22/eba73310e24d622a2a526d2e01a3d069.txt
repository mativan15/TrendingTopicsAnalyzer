A win at last for Australia in the Pacific:

Pacific Island countries have agreed not to sign a region-wide trade and security deal with China after a high-level meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his counterparts from 10 Pacific nations in Fiji.
China was seeking a wide-ranging deal that covered free trade, police cooperation and disaster resilience.
Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said Pacific nations were united in their approach after the decision was announced on Monday afternoon.
