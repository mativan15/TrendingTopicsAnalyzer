The Real Housewives of New York season 14 cast has finally been unveiled after months of speculation.
Andy Cohen previously confirmed that the iconic Bravo series, starring OGs Luann de Lesseps and Ramona Singer beside fan favorite Sonja Morgan, Leah McSweeney and newcomer Eboni Williams, would be rebooted after a lackluster 13th series.
Throughout the three-day BravoCon extravaganza, he was asked multiple times about the new cast, as well as who would be returning for the legacy spin-off, and during a special edition of Watch What Happens Live, we finally got some answers.
