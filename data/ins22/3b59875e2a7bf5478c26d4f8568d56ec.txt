bizoo_nAPA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA)—formerly named Apache—has the majority of its production in the US, but also has legacy operations in the UK's North Sea and Egypt, and discoveries in offshore Suriname (near Venezuela). Because of the challenges of selling its Alpine High natural gas, APA has struggled more than many through the 2019-2021 oil and gas downturn. Ahead of the pack it made a fortuitous contract with liquefied natural gas company Cheniere (LNG) and has benefited from recent higher oil and gas prices.
