The stock market's 9% rally from lows reached on May 20 have investors wondering if it's just another bear market rally or a sustainable move higher.Part of the uncertainty stems from the fact that more and more people see an imminent recession as consumers grapple with high inflation and rising interest rates. Meanwhile, businesses are struggling with ongoing supply chain disruptions and uncertainties surrounding the Russia-Ukraine war. Considering the heightened economic risks, it makes sense that investors have little conviction about which direction the stock market will move in the short term.
