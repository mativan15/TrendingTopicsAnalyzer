(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc.'s $315 million purchase of a GIF search engine is set to be blocked again by the UK's antitrust watchdog bringing to an end years of uncertainty over the deal. The Competition and Markets Authority said Tuesday it'll order Meta to sell Giphy Inc. for a second time after an appeals court sent the decision back to the regulator for reconsideration. An appropriate buyer will be identified at a later date. 'We are disappointed by the CMA's decision but accept today's ruling as the final word on the matter,' a Meta spokesperson said.
