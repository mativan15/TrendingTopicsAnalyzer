Is there anything the best Apple Watches can't do? With the launch of the Apple Watch Ultra and its Depth app, the Cupertino-based tech giant once again shifted the baseline upwards of what people should expect from an outdoor watch. And it's not only an excellent mountaineering companion, but given its extensive diving capabilities, the Apple Watch Ultra is also your best bet for shallow-water activities, such as swimming in a pool or open waters.However, other Apple Watch models can also be used for swimming, albeit they aren't quite as capable as a diving watch as the Apple Watch Ultra.
