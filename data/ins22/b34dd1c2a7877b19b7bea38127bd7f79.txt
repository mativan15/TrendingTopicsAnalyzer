An Irish-led 'blank cheque' company listed in New York has postponed shareholder meetings twice in recent weeks to vote on a $1.74 billion (€1.63 billion) merger, amid heightened volatility in financial markets.North Atlantic Acquisition Corporation (NAAC), founded by Irish packaging industry veteran Patrick Doran and corporate financier Gary Quin, raised $380 million in an initial public offering (IPO) in January 2021. The so-called special purpose acquisition company (Spac) agreed last December to merge with TeleSign, a digital identity verification company.
