Tony Fadell is a man you might not have heard of, but his creations have very likely influenced your life.
As a designer, engineer and entrepreneur, Fadell is responsible for co-creating the very first iPod as well as the first three generations of iPhone.
After leaving Apple, he went on to create Nest Labs, which led the way in smart home gadgety and was eventually acquired by Google.
Now 53, and with decades of experience under his belt, Fadell has decided to produce a decidedly un-techy product: a book.
