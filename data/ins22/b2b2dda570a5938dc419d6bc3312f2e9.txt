It's no surprise that cyber criminals have been quick to capitalize on weakened online security systems to create havoc throughout the pandemic. According to analysis of police data by security company Nexor, the UK saw a 31 percent rise in cybercrime amid the pandemic.  Another global security report blamed Coronavirus for a 238 percent rise in cyber attacks on banks: a 600 percent increase in phishing attacks and a 148 percent rise in ransomware attacks, all since February 2020.  There is no doubt that cyber criminals are continuing to evolve their tools and tactics to make ever more sophisticated attacks.
