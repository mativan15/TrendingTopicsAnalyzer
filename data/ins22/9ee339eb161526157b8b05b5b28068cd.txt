Rebekah Vardy has been spotted supporting her husband Jamie as he played for Leicester City, after she lost her defamation trial against Coleen Rooney.
The wag donned a baseball cap and an all-black look as she watched on, clapping for her husband and his team as they played against Crystal Palace on Saturday.
The match ended in a 0-0 draw.
Vardy has been keeping a low profile recently after she lost her defamation trial against former friend Rooney and was ordered to pay 90% of her legal costs.
The mother-of-five lost the bombshell trial, dubbed Wagatha Christie, in August when a judge ruled Rooney did not defame her by accusing Vardy's Instagram account of leaking false stories about her to the press.
