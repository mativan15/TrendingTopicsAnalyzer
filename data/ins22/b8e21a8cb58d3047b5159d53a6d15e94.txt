Construction associations hope a high school field trip will spark an interest in skilled trades as the need for workers increases in Ontario. Students from Simcoe County and Muskoka interested in skilled trades visited civil and commercial sites Wednesday. "It's very important for us to show that future generation that this is a great viable opportunity for them," said Alison Smith, Barrie Construction Association executive director. "There is a skilled trade shortage." The field trip also taught many students that not all paths to a successful career are through university.
