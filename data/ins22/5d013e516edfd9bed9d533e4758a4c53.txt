Meghnath is thinking about his dreams and trying to relate them with Science. He remembers that his father, Ravana, had told him to gain knowledge from the Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva and also from Shakti. Meghnath: Guru, where does Shakti live? Shukracharya: She is everywhere. The whole cosmic energy of the universe can be called Shakti…Meghnath: So, if I randomly locate a point, focus my mind on it, and try to speak to her, will I be able to connect with her?Shukracharya: Yes. This is also known as E=MC^2 or Einstein's way…Meghath: So Shakti is the combination of mass and light speed.
