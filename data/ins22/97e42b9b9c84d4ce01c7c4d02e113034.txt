AgenciesAn online five-letter word game, Wordle, is owned by the New York Times. Wordle is now played by millions every day. The daily guessing game is challenging, fun, and exciting, creating curiosity amongst the players. To play, visit the site and choose a random starting word. There is a new word that the player has to guess each day. When you enter a word, the colour of tiles will change, thus helping you guess the correct word. The grey letter shows that the letter is incorrect, and the yellow letter indicates that the letter is in the word, but the location is wrong.
