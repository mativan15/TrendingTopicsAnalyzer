Jun. 3—MIDLAND — It's a tradition that's 74 years in the making and it will return to the stage at the Yucca Theatre this summer.

Summer Mummers will kick off its 74th season June 3 and continue throughout the months of June, July and August before wrapping up on September 3.

Shows will take place at 7:30 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays each week.

This year's Summer Mummers show will be "Game of Homes: A Song of Dirtland" which is a parody of the HBO show "Game of Thrones."

The timing of this year's show will also be good with the Game of Thrones spinoff series "House of Dragon" set to air this August.
