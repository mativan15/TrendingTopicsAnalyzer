WBA lightweight champion Gervonta Davis (26-0, 24 KOs) will put his title on the line Saturday night against unbeaten Rolando Romero (14-0, 12 KOs). Oddsmakers have made Davis a heavy -1000 favorite, while bettors can get Romero at +600 and 20/1 on the fight ending in a draw. 
With Davis being such a big favorite, bettors will need to find other ways to make a profit from this fight, including method of victory, total rounds, and which round the fight will end. It should be noted, though, that the line has moved toward the challenger.
