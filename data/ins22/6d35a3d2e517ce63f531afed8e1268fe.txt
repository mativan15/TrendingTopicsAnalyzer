Cardinals kicker Matt Prater is still dealing with a hip injury so the team has brought in another player who can fill in if needed.

Arizona announced the club has signed Rodrigo Blankenship to the practice squad.

Blankenship started his career with the Colts, but was cut in September after missing a 42-yard field goal and sending two kickoffs out of bounds in Indianapolis' Week One tie with Houston.
