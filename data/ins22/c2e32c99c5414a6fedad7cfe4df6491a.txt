As more travelers discover the delights of Croatia, prices have been creeping upwards in keeping with the country's steadily growing popularity. You'll find more luxury hotels than ever springing up at a rapid pace, particularly in some of the upmarket resorts along the Adriatic coast and on a few of the islands. At the same time, however, there's been a surge in private apartments and family-run guesthouses, which makes it more affordable to visit Croatia if you're on a budget.
One of the biggest expenses will be your flights to Croatia, which can rise to mind-boggling levels as soon as the summer season approaches.
