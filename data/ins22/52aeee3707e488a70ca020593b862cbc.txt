Last month, the Government committed to a two-year £2,500 energy price guarantee for households with average gas and electricity usage. However, with Mr Hunt taking over from the former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, this energy bill support is now set to last until April 2023. In light of this, Jeremy Hunt is being reminded that further financial assistance will be needed even after the price guarantee comes to an end.Speaking exclusively to Express.co.uk, consumer expert Will Hodson shared his thoughts on the Government's most recent U-turn.
