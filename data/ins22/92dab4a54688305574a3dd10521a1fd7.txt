Significant progress has been made in recent weeks on the construction of the $1 billion VAI Resort hotel, the sprawling water feature and theme park next to the Cardinals stadium and Westgate Entertainment District in Glendale just east of the Loop 101.

Expected to be the largest hotel in Arizona, the resort is being developed by VAI Global Development, a newly formed entity that's owned by the executives of North Dakota and Arizona-based Fisher Industries, Tommy and Grant Fisher. Fisher Industries is also the general contractor on the project.
