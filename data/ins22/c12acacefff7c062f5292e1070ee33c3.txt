City council will vote Monday for the Windsor Essex County Health Unit (WECHU)'s application to the province for a supervised consumption and treatment site at 101 Wyandotte Street East. 'I expect it to go through pretty swiftly without much discussion because we had the discussion back in January,' said Ward 3 city councillor Rino Bortolin. 'I don't think it's going to be a long-drawn-out debate. The conversation we had in January was robust enough.' In mid-January, council voted 6-5 in favour of the site being located down the road at 628 Goyeau Street but the original deal fell through with the building owner.
