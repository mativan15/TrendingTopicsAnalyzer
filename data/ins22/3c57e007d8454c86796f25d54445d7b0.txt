After a poor three-point shooting effort in the season opener, the Lakers somehow got even worse at three-point shooting. In their second game of the season, the Lakers inexplicably shot even more three-pointers.

And each time the Lakers tossed up a three-ball Thursday night against the Clippers in their home opener at Crypto.com Arena, the likelihood of the ball settling into the net diminished.

So, two nights after the Lakers shot 10 for 40 (25%) from three-point range against Golden State, they had the nerve to shoot 45 more against the Clippers, making just nine, a shooting percentage of 20.
