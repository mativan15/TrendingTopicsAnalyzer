The Tennessee Titans are getting some much-needed salary cap relief on Thursday after the release of wide receiver Julio Jones finally processed.
The announcement of Jones being cut was made all the way back in March, but thanks to the move getting a post-June 1 designation, the money saved from cutting the veteran wideout didn't officially come off the books until now.
Parting ways with Jones incurs a $2.8 million dead-cap hit for 2022, but it also saves a whopping $9.5 million, according to Over the Cap.
