On May 27, 2022, the IRS released its sixth pronouncement regarding the types of businesses that can qualify for the qualified small business stock (QSBS) exclusion. The ruling is the fourth time the IRS has addressed the health exclusion in section 1202(e)(3), the third time it has addressed the exclusion for businesses where the principal asset is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees, and the first time the IRS has opened the door for pharmacy businesses to qualify for the QSBS exclusion.
