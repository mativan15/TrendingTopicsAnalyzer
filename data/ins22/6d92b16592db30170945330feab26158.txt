Rooster Teeth, Warner Bros. Discovery's fandom, sci-fi and gaming entertainment division, came under fire from a former employee who said she was mistreated during her time at the company — including being verbally harassed and severely underpaid. Kdin Jenzen, who worked at Rooster Teeth from 2013 until leaving earlier this year, published a 2,257-word blog post Saturday detailing her experience at the company. Jenzen was a producer and director who mainly worked in RT's Achievement Hunter games group.
