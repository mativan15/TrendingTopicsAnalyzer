ST. PETERSBURG — Maximo Park's overflow parking lot, four to five football fields wide, is where subcontractor trucks haul in fallen trees and branches collected off street curbs and haul out mulch.

Though the city has collected 40,000 cubic yards of vegetative debris in about two weeks following Hurricane Ian, there's still a ways to go. City officials said Wednesday they're about 40% done, as workers work from coastal neighborhoods in south, west and northeast St. Petersburg into the middle of the city.
