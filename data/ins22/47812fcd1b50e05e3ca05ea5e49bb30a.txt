Geena Davis this week detailed the time she politely turned down Jack Nicholson's sexual advances when she was a young model and actress by taking advice given to her by Dustin Hoffman.Davis, 66, starred with Hoffman, 85, in 1982's "Tootsie" – her first movie role – during which he advised her not to sleep with her co-stars. He told her what to say if she was ever propositioned by a leading man."'Say, well, you're very attractive. I would love to, but it would ruin the sexual tension between us,'" Davis told the New Yorker magazine of Hoffman's advise in an interview published on Thursday.
