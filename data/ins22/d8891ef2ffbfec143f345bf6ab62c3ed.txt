Quebec opposition parties are accusing Premier François Legault of trying to "buy" the next election with a promise to send Quebecers a cheque if re-elected. Legault vowed Tuesday to send Quebecers another payment to counter the rising cost of living, but only if the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) is re-elected on Oct. 3. In the spring budget, the CAQ offered $500 payments to Quebecers to offset inflation. In a press briefing on Wednesday morning, Parti Québécois (PQ) MNA Pascal Bérubé said he had never seen such payment during his 25 years in politics.
