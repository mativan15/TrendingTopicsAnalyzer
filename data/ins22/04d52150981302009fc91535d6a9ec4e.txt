Shares of ASML, one of the world's most important firms in the semiconductor supply chain, jumped 6% on Wednesday after reporting strong earnings that bucked the trend of a slowdown in the chip industry.

The Dutch company also said that the latest export curbs on high-end chips to China would have a "limited" impact on its business.

ASML does not make chips. Instead, it sells $200 million extreme ultraviolet lithography machines to semiconductor manufacturers like Taiwan's TSMC, which are required to make the most advanced chips.
