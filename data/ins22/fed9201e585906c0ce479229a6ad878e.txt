Saquon Barkley is not only having fun running the ball again, he's enjoying the winning that has come with it.

After a full offseason of doubt, Saquon Barkley has spent the beginning of the 2022 season proving to Giants fans that he is one of the elite backs in the NFL.

Through six games, he has proven just that. He proved that he is still a home run hitter from anywhere on the field. He has proven that he can make defenders miss anywhere, even in a phone booth.

And if that wasn't enough, the final proof is his ability to carry the load even if he doesn't have the numbers to show for it.
