From increasing property taxes to demanding a cut of the PST from the province, five mayoral candidates pulled no punches at an afternoon debate. With only a few days left before Winnipeggers vote, mayoral candidates who are front-runners in the latest poll made their cases during a forum hosted by the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce on Friday. The debate centred around topics important to the chamber, like economic growth and employment. "We really want to hear more about the downtown," said Loren Remillard, president & CEO of the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce.
