Investors will be quite unhappy and perhaps even 'shell-shocked' with the returns of the first nine months of 2022 as markets collapsed. Representative of these returns was the -24.8% return of the Total U.S. Market. Global stock indexes had similar returns, while U.S. Bond returns were very negative.

We illustrate how these results affected investors by reviewing how four representative investors' portfolios of $100,000 performed. These are representative of many investors' portfolios because they span from aggressive to conservative.
