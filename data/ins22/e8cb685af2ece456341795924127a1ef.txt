CVE-2022-30190, also known as 'Follina', is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability that affects Microsoft Office, reported on May 27, 2022.
How can Follina vulnerability be exploited by attackers? The way it goes is as follows:

A Microsoft Office .DOC file crafted by an attacker is sent to a target.
The .DOC file references a HTTPS: link leading to an HTML file containing obfuscated JavaScript code.
The JavaScript code references another link with an identifier MS-MSDT: instead of the usual HTTPS: identifier.
