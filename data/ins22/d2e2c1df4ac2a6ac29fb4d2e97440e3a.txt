We've long known that going for walks and spending time in nature are both really good for our mental health. 
Well, a simple reframing of what you think about while you're on a walk can have its own unique and significant health and happiness boost. 
‘Awe walks' are all about shifting your focus outward instead of in. 
Psychotherapist Noel McDermott describes awe walks as ‘simple and accessible'.
An awe walk is the practise of consciously noticing the world around us and allowing ourselves to feel small in comparison to that world.
