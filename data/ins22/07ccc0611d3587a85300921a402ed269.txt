'Well, there might be somebody else I'd prefer more,' Pence said at a Georgetown University event late Wednesday when asked if he would support Trump if he runs in the next presidential election. 'What I can tell you is, I have every confidence that the Republican Party is going to sort out leadership,' Pence continued.
