Japan's prime minister Fumio Kishida has ordered an investigation into the Unification Church in a move which could strip the group of its 'religious corporation' status.

Mr Kishida said he has asked the education ministry to investigate the Unification Church's problematic 'spiritual sales' tactics.

This is the first time the government will exercise its authority to investigate a religious group based on the country's Religious Corporation Law, reported The Japan Times.

'We will deal with the religious group deemed to be problematic in a strict manner, including under the Religious Corporation Law,' the prime minister said.
