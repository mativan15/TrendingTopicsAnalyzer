Dundee United boss Liam Fox says his side's failure to pose enough threat to Kilmarnock despite enjoying control in the second half cost them the League Cup quarter-final.Kyle Lafferty's penalty gave the Ayrshire side an early lead but Glenn Middleton equalised minutes later at Rugby Park.Tony Watt then missed a good chance and Danny Armstrong headed in a second-half winner.Fox added: 'Fair play to Kilmarnock for getting a second goal to win the game, but it's disappointing for us.'We got back level but then didn't really kick on.
