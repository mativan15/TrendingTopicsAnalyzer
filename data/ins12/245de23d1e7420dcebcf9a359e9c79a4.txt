Harry Kane's goal against Everton on Saturday kept the Tottenham forward on course for an historic double.Kane needs just nine more goals to surpass Jimmy Greaves's all-time record of 266 for Spurs and, with the World Cup looming, he is just two shy of Wayne Rooney's record England haul. All being well, Kane will surely celebrate becoming the top scorer for club and country in the same season, possibly even in the same month.Against Manchester United tonight, Kane is vying for a far less meaningful milestone, but one which nonetheless reflects his consistency: if he scores, he will become the first Spurs player to find the net in six consecutive Premier League games, despite the sense that he is still working his way through the gears this season.
