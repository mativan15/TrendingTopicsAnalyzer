In 2019, two of her fellow students died after a gunman opened fire on the school's quad. She and her sister survived. 'Almost 2,000 kids die a year from gun violence. Is that not enough for you? Do you have no sympathy, no empathy, no care for others?' Madison Roeschke said, also speaking directly to the NRA.
