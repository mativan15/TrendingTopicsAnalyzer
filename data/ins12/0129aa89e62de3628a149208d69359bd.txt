An East Walnut Hills restaurant has closed its doors after just more than three years in business.

The owners of Branch at 1535 Madison Road in East Walnut Hills announced on Facebook Oct. 14 the restaurant had permanently closed.

"Though we are sad to say goodbye we are also filled with immense gratitude," the Facebook post read. "We thank all the teammates, guests and community members who supported us. We wish you all nothing but the best."

The owners of the Littlefield restaurant and neighboring bar Second Place in Northside opened Branch in the former Central Trust Bank in East Walnut Hills, as well as a sister bar called Night Drop in the bank's basement, in December 2018.
