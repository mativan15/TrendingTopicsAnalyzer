In this year's American League Championship Series, the Yankees are trying to turn the tide against an Astros club that has had their number in the postseason. 
Going back to 2015, when Houston snapped a nine-season playoff drought, it has defeated New York in a postseason series three straight times, if you include the 2015 AL Wild Card Game. Another victory this time around would push that streak into truly rare territory.
Since the Divisional Era began in 1969, when the playoffs expanded beyond the World Series, there have been 17 instances of one team winning at least three consecutive postseason series matchups against another team (including Wild Card Games), according to the Elias Sports Bureau.
