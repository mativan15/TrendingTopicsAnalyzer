BEIJING — China, the world's second-largest economy, announced without explanation on Monday that it was delaying indefinitely the release of economic data that had been scheduled for Tuesday morning, including closely watched numbers for economic growth from July through September, which had been expected to show continued lackluster performance.

The delay by China's National Bureau of Statistics comes as the country's ruling elite has gathered in Beijing for a weeklong, twice-a-decade national congress of the Communist Party.
