How many times a week do you find a cool visual artist on Instagram, 'save' their work in the app, and move along to never revisit them again? Le PÈRE, a burgeoning menswear label out of Brooklyn, is looking to change that.Dreamt up by a team of seasoned music and fashion executives, most of whom have chosen to remain anonymous, Le PÈRE was founded to 'integrate the world of visual art through clothes, providing consumers a unique perspective and offering every season.' In simple terms, the label has set out to cultivate a community of creators and shopper-collectors by hosting a crop of collaborators each season, including emerging and established artists, designers, and illustrators, among others.
