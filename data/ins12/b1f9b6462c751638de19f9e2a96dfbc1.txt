Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday accused the Congress of 'making fun of tribal culture for political gain' and said that when the time came, the tribals 'always settled the scores'. 
Speaking at Gunsada village of Songadh taluka in the tribal-dominated district of Tapi in South Gujarat on Thursday, where he inaugurated and dedicated projects worth Rs 2,192 crore, Modi said, 'These Congress governments were never concerned about your bright future, their mind was only on the elections… make false promises before the elections, then forget about it.
