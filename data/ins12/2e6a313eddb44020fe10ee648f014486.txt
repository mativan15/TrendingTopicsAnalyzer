It is the end of electoral politics for BJP veteran and two-term former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal as he opted out of the November 12 state polls leaving his supporters stunned.The 78-year-old was lying low ever since he suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of protege-turned-foe Rajinder Singh Rana from the Sujanpur assembly segment in the 2017 elections.One reason for his stepping back may be him having crossed the age limit of 75 years fixed by the BJP for its leaders to retire from electoral politics.
