After six years of underwhelming offense, the Denver Broncos hired offensive-minded coach Nathaniel Hackett this offseason to turn things around.

Through his first six games in charge, Hackett has failed. Denver is averaging just 15.2 points per game, fewer than any other team in the NFL. Hackett was supposed to fix the offense but instead, the unit looks even worse than it did before the coach arrived.

So, what do the Broncos do now?

Hackett is unlikely to be fired this week. But if the team loses to the New York Jets at home and then to the Jacksonville Jaguars in London, Denver would then be 2-6 going into a Week 9 bye.
