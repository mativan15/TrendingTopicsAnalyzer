You remember Plenty of Fish? You don't? That's okay. In a world of infinite Tinders and Hinges, Plenty of Fish has definitely slipped to the end of the list of go-to dating apps. In a bid to reinvent themselves, the company is looking to rebrand their efforts at playing Cupid by launching an in-app game tomorrow.According to a report from Fast Company, Plenty of Fish will be featuring a new game called Cue'd Up in their app in an attempt to get people meeting before actually matching. Cue'd Up will see a maximum of six users answering various prompts across four rounds, before voting on who has the best answers.
