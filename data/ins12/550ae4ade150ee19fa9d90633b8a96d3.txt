(Bloomberg) -- Directors are stepping down from the boards of five public technology companies after the US Justice Department raised antitrust concerns about individuals advising competing businesses -- the opening salvo in an economy-wide push likely to hit private equity and other financial investment firms.   The action announced Wednesday marks the DOJ's first foray in an initiative to enforce a rarely invoked 1914 law against so-called interlocking directorates, where individuals or entities sit on the board of directors for two companies that directly compete with one another.
