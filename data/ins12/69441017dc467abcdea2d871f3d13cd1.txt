Newcastle transfer target Sven Botman is clear that he wants to leave French side Lille before he has to return to the club for pre-season training. And the defender has revealed that talks are underway with potential suitors. The Magpies could face a tug-of-war with AC Milan to sign the star when the transfer window opens next Friday.Botman joined Lille from Ajax in the summer of 2020 despite never making a first-team appearance for the Dutch club. And the centre-back was soon handed a key role at the heart of the Lille defence as his team stunned Paris Saint-Germain to win the Ligue 1 title at the end of his first season in France.
