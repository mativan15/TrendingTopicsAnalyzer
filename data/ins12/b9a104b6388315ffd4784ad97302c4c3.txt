Giorgia Meloni, the right-wing Italian politician whose Brothers of Italy party won a plurality of the vote in national elections last month, announced Friday she had built a ruling coalition and would formally assume power.
Meloni, 45, delivered the news to Italian President Sergio Mattarella Friday, and made no public comment.
'Giorgia Meloni has accepted the mandate and has presented her list of ministers,' presidential official Ugo Zampetti told reporters following the meeting.
Meloni is expected to be sworn in as Prime minister on Saturday.
