Nagpur: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday called for an amicable resolution to the Gyanvapi mosque-Kashi Vishwanath temple dispute, suggested that the Hindu and Muslim sides should sit across the table to settle the matter amicably, and stressed that there will be no agitation over the issue once the court delivers its verdict — no matter which way it goes.Bhagwat also cautioned Hindu groups against raising fresh disputes over religious places every other day. Why look for Shivlings in every mosque, he asked, in a strong reference to fresh claims in recent weeks about evidence of Hindu idols in monuments ranging from the Qutub Minar to the Ajmer Dargah to the Taj Mahal.
