A Punjab BJP leader Friday moved the Supreme Court for a CBI investigation into the killing of singer Sidhu Moosewala, citing suspected involvement of interstate and international gangsters in the crime. The plea filed by Jagjit Singh contended the state administration had not only "miserably failed" in preventing the crime but also the gang wars that have created "a storm of fear and terror" in Punjab. "The way the cold-blooded killing was done in broad daylight is indicative of the fact that the state machinery in the state of Punjab has miserably failed in its duty not only to prevent the crime but also to effectively curb the menace of gang wars.
