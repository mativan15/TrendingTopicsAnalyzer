Asia In Brief Chinese president Xi Jinping has opened the 20th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party with a call for the nation he leads to win the race for development of 'core technologies' and to become self-reliant in strategic tech.
The speech marked a shift in president Xi's language since his remarks at the same event five years earlier, when he spoke of markets driving innovation. In his Sunday speech he spoke of innovation being focused on national strategic requirements – therefore led by the State - and linked the development and implementation of information technology to national security.
