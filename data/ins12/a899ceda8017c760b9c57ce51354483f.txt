World No.1 Iga Swiatek has emerged red hot from a rain delay to beat American Jessica Pegula 4-6 6-2 6-2 and reach the San Diego Open final.

Swiatek awaits either American Danielle Collins or Croatia's Donna Vekic for the title on Sunday.

The reigning US Open champion from Poland sprinted out to a 4-2 lead in the first set before Pegula roared back, reeling off four straight games and capturing the first set on Swiatek's 11th forehand error of the frame.

Rain postponed the start of the second set by more than an hour and the break appeared to boost Swiatek, who was sharper in the second set, breaking Pegula with a forehand winner on the line to level the contest at a set apiece.
