[Photo/Agencies] New priorities hailed as 'a move in the right direction' to improve govt balance Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has reversed most of the tax cuts in the minibudget announced by the government last month in a bid to rebuild investor confidence. On Monday, Hunt, who replaced Kwasi Kwarteng on Friday after the former chancellor's mini-budget was poorly received by financial markets and caused a surge in government borrowing costs, said a planned 1 percentage point cut in income tax due in April will now not happen and that the rate would remain the same "indefinitely until economic circumstances allow for it to be cut".
