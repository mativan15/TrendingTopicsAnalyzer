Tex-Mex restaurant coming to Oak Lawn

A restaurant that features Tex-Mex cuisine is expected to fill the space formerly occupied by the Gaslight Bar and Grill in Oak Lawn.

Gaslight closed recently after neighbors complained of rowdy behavior by patrons leaving at closing time.

Oak Lawn Mayor Terry Vorderer, who is also the village liquor commissioner, called for the suspension of Gaslight's business license after a fatal, four-vehicle crash near 110th and Cicero Aug. 21. Two individuals who reportedly had left the bar caused the crash that killed two people, police said.
