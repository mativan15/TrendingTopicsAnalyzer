Two Washington heavyweights are set to campaign with North Carolina Democratic Senate hopeful Cheri Beasley, lending the former state Supreme Court justice a bit of star power in the closing weeks of her campaign.

Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) will make three stops with Beasley on Wednesday, while Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), the highest-ranking Black member of Congress, will join them for their second event of the day, Beasley's campaign announced.

The race between Beasley and Budd has been a dead heat for months, with polling averages showing the two candidates separated by only a couple percentage points.
