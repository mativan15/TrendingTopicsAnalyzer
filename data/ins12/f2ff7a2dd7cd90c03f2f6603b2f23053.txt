Former President Donald Trump claimed that nine documents, including clemency requests and packages on immigration policies, seized from Mar-a-Lago are his personal property, according to new court filings addressing the special master reviewing the materials.
The Justice Department filed a letter on Thursday, describing disputes over ownership and executive privilege claims involving a batch of 15 records that have undergone early review, according to The New York Times. 
The seized materials, including classified information, were discovered at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in August as part of the FBI's search.
