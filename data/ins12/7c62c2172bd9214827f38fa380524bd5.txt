(This story originally appeared in on Jun 02, 2022)The Associated Journals Ltd, publisher of the National Herald newspaper, had become almost defunct by 2008 when its owners, Congress party, decided to cease the printing and publishing business and started exploring commercial options by renting out AJL's properties situated at prime locations in Delhi, Mumbai, Panchkula, Lucknow and Patna. These properties were acquired over the years with the help of Congress governments in the states in which these cities are located at paltry sums for the specific purpose of printing and publishing newspapers.
