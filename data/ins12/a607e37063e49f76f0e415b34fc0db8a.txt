Sydney's The Star casino has been fined a whopping $100m following a damning inquiry into its 'confronting' and 'shocking' conduct.

Adam Bell SC last month handed down a report that exposed alleged money laundering, organised crime links and fraud at The Star, with the NSW independent Casino Commission (NICC) subsequently finding it unit to hold a casino licence within the state.



The $100m fine was issued by the NICC on Monday, the maximum penalty that can be given following tough casino regulation reforms that were introduced by the state government earlier this year.
