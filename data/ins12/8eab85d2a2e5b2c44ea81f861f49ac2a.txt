LONDON (AP) — Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson -- ousted by ethics scandals just three months ago -- jockeyed to make a comeback Friday as one of several contenders seeking to replace Liz Truss, whose rapid downfall threw the country's leadership into disarray at a time of severe economic challenges.
The governing Conservative Party has ordered a lightning-fast race that aims to finalize nominations Monday and install a new prime minister within a week. 
Johnson has not declared he is running, but a political ally who spoke with him told Sky News he is 'up for it' and bookmakers have made him one of the favorites to win the contest — a reflection of the disarray in the party as it picks its third prime minister this year.
