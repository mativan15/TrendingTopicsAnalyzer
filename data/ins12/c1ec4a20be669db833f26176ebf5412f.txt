Florida right guard O'Cyrus Torrence and JACK linebacker Brenton Cox Jr. are among the 90 players who landed on the Rotary Lombardi Award watchlist Monday when the committee released its midseason update.

According to the award's website, the accolade 'goes annually to the college football lineman — offense or defense — who, in addition to outstanding performance and ability, best exemplifies the character and discipline of Vince Lombardi.' A subcommittee of the Rotary Lombardi Award committee compiles the watchlist and includes SID submissions.
