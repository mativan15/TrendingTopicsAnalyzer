About 18 months after taking over JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (JB) from the promoters for ₹3,100 crore, private equity major KKR, through a new leadership team, has brought in a marked improvement in its performance, functioning and ranking in the pharma industry, a top executive said. 'We had a good asset in hand when we bought the company,' JB's CEO Nikhil Chopra said in an interview. 'We have strengthened our processes and systems and are now driving better governance. Today there is better discipline in optimisation of resources, how to get the best out of the team, how to get into the most progressive category of business,' he added.
