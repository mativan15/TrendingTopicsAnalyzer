Points machine Tommy Makinson insists England will not get carried away following their impressive start to the World Cup.

The opening fixture could hardly have gone better for Shaun Wane's men as they demolished a talented Samoa team billed as pre-match favourites 60-6 at Newcastle's St James' Park.

With further group games to come against France and minnows Greece, the win virtually assures England of a place in the knockout stages and, if they were able to finish top, they would most likely avoid another dangerous Pacific Island nation, Tonga, in the quarter-finals.
