AsiaVision Doximity, Inc.(NYSE:DOCS) took the market by storm on the IPO day in June 2021, when the stock became uber-popular and was bid up more than 100% in one day. At the time, the market participants couldn't stop themself from buying anything remotely growing and Doximity was actually quite unique as it was also very profitable as well. Like pretty much anything else these days, the stock was not able to hold those highs for long and is now sitting even below the IPO price, down around 75% from all-time highs.
