After my schooling at a CBSE school, I decided to follow my passion and build a career in Quantitative Financing. I developed a liking for Finance after attending a conference at which an investment banker spoke. I enjoyed Economics and wanted to study Accounting, which is why I chose BSc. Money, Banking and Finance at the University of Birmingham Dubai. While my application process was relatively easy since I received the Vice Chancellor's Scholarship, it is advisable to get in touch with the student services as early as possible.
