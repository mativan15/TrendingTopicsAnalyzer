Infamous fast-fashion giant Shein is back in the spotlight, after a new investigation found its factory workers are paid as little as 4 cents per garment while working 18-hour shifts.

The new documentary by the UK's Channel 4, ‘Untold: Inside the Shein Machine', takes viewers behind the scenes at some of the Chinese factories churning out the e-tailers clothes.

While shocking, the hidden camera findings will come as no surprise to those familiar with the company's human rights and environmental record.
