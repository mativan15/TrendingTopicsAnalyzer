Stocks worldwide have taken a beating this year, and major indexes remain deep in negative territory. As investors weigh whether to sell or stay invested, CNBC Pro screened almost 1,500 large and mid-cap global stocks and found a number of major companies with sell or underweight ratings. Seven of the stocks — all part of the MSCI World Index — have analysts' price targets below their current share price, according to FactSet data. Equity analysts at investment banks and research firms rate stocks as sell or underweight if they believe the shares will perform poorly over the next 12 months.
