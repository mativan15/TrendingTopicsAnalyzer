Published: 09:02 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 09:02 EDT, 2 June 2022 Joe Cole has backed West Ham forward Jarrod Bowen to flourish in an England shirt. The 25-year-old has shone for David Moyes' Hammers this season and would have been called up by the Three Lions in March was it not for a foot injury. Bowen scored 18 goals in all competitions and provided 13 more during a memorable campaign that is set for an unforgettable conclusion, having been included in the England squad for the first time. Ex-West Ham star Cole is excited to see his debut in the upcoming Nations League fixtures and believes the former Hull man has the attributes to succeed at international level.
