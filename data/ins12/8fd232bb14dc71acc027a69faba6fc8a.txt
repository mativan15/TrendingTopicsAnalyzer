Even if much of the discourse about Aptos this week has ranged from snide remarks to outright condemnation, the newest cryptocurrency on the market is gaining a lot of attention, generating considerable volume in its first few days of trading.

As of Friday afternoon, APT, the native coin of the Aptos blockchain, has done at least $1.3 billion in volume since Wednesday, its first full day of trading, according to CoinGecko. It's an interesting counterpoint to all of the derision that the project took on Crypto Twitter, which is the closest thing the industry has to a town square.
