On Aug 10, a white paper titled "The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era" also asserted that the CPC will unswervingly promote the complete reunification of the motherland and that the process of complete reunification was unstoppable, demonstrating the determination of the Party, the Chinese government and the Chinese people to defend the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
