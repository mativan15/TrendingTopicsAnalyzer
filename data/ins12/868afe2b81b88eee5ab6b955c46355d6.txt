Long term investing works well, but it doesn't always work for each individual stock. We don't wish catastrophic capital loss on anyone. Spare a thought for those who held CareRx Corporation (TSE:CRRX) for five whole years - as the share price tanked 81%. And we doubt long term believers are the only worried holders, since the stock price has declined 46% over the last twelve months. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 24% in the last 90 days. While a drop like that is definitely a body blow, money isn't as important as health and happiness.
