It's just a few weeks into third-quarter earnings season, but so far, it hasn't been nearly as bad as Wall Street feared. In fact, the number of companies that have met or beat earnings expectations is only lagging previous seasons by a few percentage points – basically, results are holding up. Through Thursday morning, 75% of S & P 500 companies that had reported earnings had exceeded expectations, according to data from The Earnings Scout. That's not too far off the trend over the last three years, where about 80% beat expectations, according to Nick Raich from The Earnings Scout.
