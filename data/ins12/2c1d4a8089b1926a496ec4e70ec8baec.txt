1. Montrose (6-2) at Mesa Ridge (6-2) — C.A. Foster Stadium, Thursday at 7 p.m.

Sophomore quarterback Bryce Riehl and company are set for their toughest test since facing Palmer Ridge.

Senior Carver Cheeks set the program's career receiving touchdowns record last week and will look to help Riehl against a Montrose defense that has allowed just 12 points in the last two weeks, combined.

2. Falcon (2-6) at Air Academy (5-3) — Air Academy High School, Friday at 7 p.m.

Air Academy senior Sam Beers leads the state in rushing and will face a stout Falcon defense line in hopes of adding to his lead.
