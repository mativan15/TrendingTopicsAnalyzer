The Ethiopian federal government on Tuesday said it has taken control of three towns in the northern Tigray region. "The ENDF [Ethiopian National Defence Force] has taken control of towns of Shire, Alamata and Korem without fighting in urban areas," a government statement posted to Twitter said. The Tigrayan forces meanwhile confirmed losing control of the key and populous town of Shire to the federal forces. Tigrayan authorities are now urging citizens in the region to fight back.  The federal government had on Monday said it wanted to take control of airports and other federal facilities in Tigray, claiming it is necessary to seize key infrastructure in the north to protect airspace and distribute humanitarian aid.
