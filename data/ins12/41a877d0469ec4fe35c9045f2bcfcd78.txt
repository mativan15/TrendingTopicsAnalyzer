Oct. 18—Kennesaw State announced the hiring of two new members to its baseball staff this week.

Former Owls outfielder Terence Norman will be the team's director of baseball operations, and Brad Tyler has joined the team as an assistant coach on Ryan Coe's staff.

"Really excited to welcome Brad and Terence to the KSU baseball staff," Coe said in a release, adding that "both of these guys will play a part in the growth and development of our baseball team."

Norman not only spent time playing at Kennesaw State, but he also played his high school baseball around the corner at Kennesaw Mountain.
