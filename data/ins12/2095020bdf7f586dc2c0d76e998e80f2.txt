Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's friends in London are whispering that the former royals have been complaining they were snubbed and mistreated at Queen Elizabeth's funeral.

They both whined that the family wasn't as welcoming as they should have been.

Harry is now in L.A. rewriting the last chapter of his autobiography to include the palace intrigue around their trip to England for the funeral of his grandmother.

Insiders say that Penguin Random House paid more than $15 million for his story and they want it to contain scandalous, headline-grabbing news.
