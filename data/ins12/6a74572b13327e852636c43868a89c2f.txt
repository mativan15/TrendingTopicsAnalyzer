Texting is a very popular way to communicate with people on wireless phones. But, for first lady Jill Biden and her husband, the president, the activity is often known as 'fexting.'
Jill Biden told Harper's Bazaar magazine recently that when Joe Biden was vice president, the couple would settle their arguments over text so their security guards would not have to hear them fight. As a result, fighting and texting became fexting.
But, now Joe Biden is president. And that made fexting a little different, Jill Biden learned.
