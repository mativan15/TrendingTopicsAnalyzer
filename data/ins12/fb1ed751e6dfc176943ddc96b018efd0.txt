Way back in 2010, Marc Lore struck a more than half-a-billion dollar deal to sell Quidsi — the company behind Diapers.com and Soap.com — to Amazon. The blow-out acquisition helped turn Amazon into 'the everything store,' but twelve years later, Lore described the sale as 'upsetting.'
'We sold out,' said Lore — who co-founded both Quidsi.com and Jet.com — at Disrupt 2022.
'With Walmart, we were happy to sell; we saw that as a way to accelerate our vision,' said the billionaire of the 2016 sale of Jet.
