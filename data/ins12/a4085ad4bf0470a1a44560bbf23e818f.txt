Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver and return specialist Jamal Agnew suffered a 'strain in his knee' and is day-to-day, coach Doug Pederson told reporters Monday.
Agnew, 27, signed with the Jaguars on a three-year, $14.25 million deal in 2021 after recording five return touchdowns in four seasons with the Detroit Lions. In his first season with Jacksonville, Agnew had a kick return for a touchdown and returned a missed field goal for a touchdown.

In addition to his contributions on special teams, Agnew has also transitioned from defensive back to wide receiver and has made an impact on offense.
