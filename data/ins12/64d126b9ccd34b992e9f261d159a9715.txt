Gabby Logan and Dermot O'Leary have joked that she was given her MBE in 2020 for ‘services to breastfeeding' after giving advice to both Queen Elizabeth II and Camilla, Queen Consort.
The presenter and former gymnast recalled the separate conversations she had had with the two Royals over the years while on This Morning on Monday, who were both fascinated with how she had managed to breastfeed twins at the same time.
