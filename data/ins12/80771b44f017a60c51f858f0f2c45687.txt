MILITANT rail unions will be banned from bringing the UK to a standstill under tough new minimum service laws introduced this week.
Limits could see rail operators forced to run a 40 per cent service even during militant walk outs.

The new laws will be laid this week in Parliament, and will match similar regs that are in place for transport networks across Western Europe including France and Spain.
It will mean transport services – including rail, tubes and buses – cannot be completely shut down when unions walkout.
