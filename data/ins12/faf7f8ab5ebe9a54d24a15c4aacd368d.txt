Treasury bills are right up there in the competition for the dullest of asset classes. But right now, some investors might think dull is good, especially when it yields close to 4%. Just like their longer duration brethren, the yields on short-term Treasury bills have been ripping higher. The yield on the 3-month Treasury bill, for example, stood at 3.99% Thursday, the highest since 2007. It had crossed above 1% in May for the first time since the pandemic broke out in March, 2020. Even before the pandemic, the yield on the 3-month bill was less than 2%.
