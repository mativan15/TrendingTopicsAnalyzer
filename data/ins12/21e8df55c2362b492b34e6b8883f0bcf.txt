6.14amThe northern Victorian town of Kerang has been cut off from surrounding areas due to floodwaters. Evacuation warnings are also in place for swathes of Echuca (also in the state's north). The Murray River, which separates Echuca from the NSW town of Moama, is expected to peak tomorrow. Authorities are worried the river could surpass levels not seen since 1993 when it reached 95 metres above sea level. In NSW, the Murrumbidgee River is flooding at Narrandera (northwest of Wagga Wagga). Major flooding is expected downstream at Hay over the weekend.
