Western Conference

1. Golden State: If anybody can overcome the drama caused by Draymond Green's punch of Jordan Poole, it's Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and coach Steve Kerr.

2. L.A. Clippers: They may not finish as the No. 2 seed in the regular season with the injury history of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, but they are deep and can play any style.

3. Denver: Fans might have forgotten how good this team can be when Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. are healthy around two-time MVP Nikola Jokic.
