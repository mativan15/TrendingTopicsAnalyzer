Agencies"The Watcher," a new Netflix series, is based on a true-life stalking incident. This psychological thriller/drama is based on a couple and their kids, whose home became an unsafe place as they started getting threatening letters from unknown people. The family does not plan to watch the series. The family watched the trailer and were reminded of their traumatic past. The Broaddus family was never interested in making the most traumatic part of their lives into an opportunity to entertain other people.
