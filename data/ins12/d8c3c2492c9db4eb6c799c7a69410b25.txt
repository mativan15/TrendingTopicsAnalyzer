NSE Indices, a subsidiary of the National Stock Exchange, has proposed to exclude or include a company from or into the indices closer to the event. The plan, if approved, may avert sharp swings in shares prices of companies that are in the process of merger or demerger on account of forced selling and purchases by passive funds that track these indices. The move comes ahead of the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger. NSE Indices has sought market participants' feedback on the ‘treatment of merger and demerger' in the Nifty indices by November 2.
