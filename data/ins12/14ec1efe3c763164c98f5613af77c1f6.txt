About 3300 Bromley households living with a stench from Christchurch's fire-damaged wastewater plant are eligible for a $200 payment. Those wanting the money have to wait a few days because Prezzy card stocks are low. There have been reports of people stealing bills from letterboxes to illegitimately claim the money. Residents must now provide ID to get the money. People are reportedly stealing bills from east Christchurch letterboxes to illegitimately obtain $200 payments meant for a community struggling to live with a pungent stench.
