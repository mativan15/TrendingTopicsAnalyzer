SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's former defense minister and coast guard chief were arrested Saturday over their alleged involvement in covering up facts and distorting the circumstances surrounding North Korea's killing of a South Korean fisheries official in 2020 near the rivals' tense sea border.

The arrests came as the government of conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol expands investigations into the 2020 killing and another border incident the year before that prompted criticism that Seoul's previous liberal administration improperly appeased the North to improve ties.
