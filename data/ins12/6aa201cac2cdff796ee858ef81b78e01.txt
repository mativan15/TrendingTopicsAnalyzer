A survey of small business owners shows more than half of small businesses have unfilled job openings.
 
The NFIB's monthly jobs report found that the labor shortage continues to be a challenge for small businesses, with 51% reporting job openings they could not fill during May, up four points from April and matching a 48-year record high set in September. Twenty-three percent of owners reported labor quality was their top business problem, second to inflation. Twelve percent of owners cited labor costs as their top business problem.
