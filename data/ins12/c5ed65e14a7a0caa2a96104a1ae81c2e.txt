Rishi Sunak got a string of endorsements from MPs early on Friday to be Britain's next Prime Minister.

However, the ex-Chancellor was still believed to be trailing former Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the number of MPs who have signalled who they are backing.

As the Tory party was engulfed again in a race to choose a new leader, Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt had also gained some support. But Mr Sunak was seeing the most new MPs backing him early on Friday, which may be a sign that his campaign is more advanced than his rivals.
