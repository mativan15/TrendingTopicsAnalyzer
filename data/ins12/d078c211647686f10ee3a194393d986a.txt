The Princely House of Liechtenstein is one of the oldest Austrian noble houses in Europe, with a long and rich history dating back to the 12th century. The name Liechtenstein was first mentioned in about 1136. The uninterrupted family line began with Heinrich I von Liechtenstein (who died in 1265/66). Liechtenstein Castle, the ancestral estate of the Princes of Liechtenstein, still stands in Maria Enzersdorf in Lower Austria on the outskirts of the Vienna Woods. It was mentioned in a document in 1330 as 'ein Haus ze Liechtenstain'.
