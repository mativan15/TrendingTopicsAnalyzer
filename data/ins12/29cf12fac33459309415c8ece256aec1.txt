HoYoverse, the company behind Genshin Impact, Tears of Themis, and others, has released a new animated Genshin Impact trailer called "Scenery and Sentiment: Mondstadt Edition" that showcases Genshin Impact's first region. In it, notable NPCs from Mondstadt are shown briefly throughout, living their lives in and around the windswept town. HoYoverse shared that this trailer was produced by Danish animation studio, Sun Creature Studio, clearly noting it's different from their animated series project with Ufotable.
