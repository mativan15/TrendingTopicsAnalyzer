SAN FRANCISCO — The Warriors will have to lean more on their reserves early on this season as the starters continue to grind their way back to their regular workload.
On the eve of the season opener, which will also be ring night for the reigning champions, coach Steve Kerr said the team's conditioning is still not up to par with where it needs to be heading into the regular season.
'I don't think we're ready to have our top five or six guys play 30-plus minutes a night,' Kerr told reporters after practice Monday.
