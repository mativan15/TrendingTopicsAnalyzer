IRVINE —

President Biden and Rep. Katie Porter sought to focus voters' attention on Democrats' work to lower the cost of prescription drugs during an event in Orange County on Friday afternoon. With inflation likely to be Democrats' biggest liability in next month's midterm elections, Biden and Porter (D-Irvine) eagerly emphasized what their party had already done to try to reduce consumer costs.

The Inflation Reduction Act, a domestic spending package Biden signed into law in August, expands access to healthcare under the Affordable Care Act, allows Medicare to negotiate with drug companies, lowers the cost of insulin and imposes a $2,000 annual cap on seniors' out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs.
