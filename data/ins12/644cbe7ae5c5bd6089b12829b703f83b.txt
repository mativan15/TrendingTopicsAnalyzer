An additional $7.5 million has been announced for the Creative Saskatchewan Feature Film and Television Production Grant Program, the provincial government said in a news release. That brings total funds available to $17.5 million for 2022-23. The 2022-23 provincial budget included an increase of $8 million in funding and immediately attracted more attention to Saskatchewan as potential location for film and television projects. "The response we've seen to the initial $10 million has been amazing with 13 projects receiving support through the Creative Saskatchewan Feature Film and Television Grant Program," Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Laura Ross said in a release.
