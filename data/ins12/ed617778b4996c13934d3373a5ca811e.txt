Rolling Stone‘s interview series King for a Day features long-form conversations between senior writer Andy Greene and singers who had the difficult job of fronting major rock bands after the departure of an iconic vocalist. Some of them stayed in their bands for years, while others lasted just a few months. In the end, however, they all found out that replacement singers can themselves be replaced. This edition features former Furthur singer John Kadlecik. In the years following Jerry Garcia's death, the surviving members of the Grateful Dead have worked with many incredible musicians who attempted to fill the enormous gap he left behind — including Trey Anastasio, John Mayer, Warren Haynes, Jimmy Herring, and Steve Kimock.
