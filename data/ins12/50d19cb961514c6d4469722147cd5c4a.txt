Liz Truss is in the 'last chance saloon' and will probably have to stand down 'quite soon', a Tory MP has said.

Steve Double, who represents Newquay, made the comments in an interview this morning, becoming the sixth Conservative MP to publicly call for the prime minister to quit.

'I think her position is becoming increasingly untenable,' he told Times Radio.

'I think it's becoming abundantly clear when you look at the loss of confidence in her as prime minister from the general public, and increasingly I think the loss of confidence in her from the parliamentary party, that we are going to get to the point where she really does have to consider her position and for the good of the country, step aside, and I think we will probably come to that place quite soon.
