phuttaphat tipsana/iStock via Getty Images RBC Capital Markets analyst Ashish Sabadra has downgraded shares of Equifax (NYSE:EFX) to Sector Perform from Outperform as mortgage, foreign exchange and interest-rate headwinds are set to keep weighing on revenue growth next year. Equifax (EFX) stock slipped 0.8% in Friday premarket trading, after sliding 6.2% in the prior session, when the company cut year guidance as the housing cooldown hurt its Mortgage Solutions revenue. "In addition, mix shift and investments partially offset by cloud savings could weigh on margins, while higher interest expense could weigh on EPS growth," Sabadra wrote in a recent note to clients.
