LONDON — Rishi Sunak's campaign had a simple slogan when he ran for prime minister of Britain earlier this year: 'Ready for Rishi.'The answer was: No, sorry.Sunak competed against Liz Truss to lead Britain's Conservative Party after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his scandal-induced resignation in July. Now Sunak will have another chance at winning the top job, with Truss's own resignation after just six weeks in power. This time, he's the favorite — at least, according to bookies. No matter that the front-runner has not yet even formally declared that he will run for party leader.
