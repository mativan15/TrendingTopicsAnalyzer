The sizzling pandemic-fueled Hamptons real estate market may be starting to cool, but in its wake is a renovation frenzy now upending the East End. 'What's going on in East Hampton is a nightmare,' said one resident who is worried about having a not-so-peaceful summer. 'The [new] Tesla parking lot is a complete eyesore, huge new houses take up entire lots, there are dirt piles and trucks everywhere. I miss the quaint days when the only thing stressing me out was a landscaper's trailer parked on the edge of someone's grass,' they added.
