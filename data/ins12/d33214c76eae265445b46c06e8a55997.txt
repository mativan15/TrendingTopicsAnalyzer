California may lose its long-held crown this year as the No. 1 state for initial public offerings.

The Golden State has been the top producer of companies going public in IPOs every year since 2003. But so far this year, Massachusetts is in the lead, if only by a hair, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Ten Bay State companies have gone public in IPOs thus far this year, compared to nine California ones. More impressively, those Massachusetts companies have raised $1.2 billion in their offerings — more than six times that of their California counterparts.
