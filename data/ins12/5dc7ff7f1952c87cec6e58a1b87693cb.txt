ANITwo people have been arrested in Punjab's Bathinda after posters of a beauty contest surfaced in the city promising the winner a a chance to marry a Canadian NRI groom. The posters were found pasted on walls at several places in Bathinda earlier this week saying that a competition of "beautiful women" of "general category" will be organised at a local hotel on October 23.

The posters said the winner will be offered a chance to get married to an NRI from Canada, prompting the police to act against the organisers under relevant sections of the IPC and the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986.
