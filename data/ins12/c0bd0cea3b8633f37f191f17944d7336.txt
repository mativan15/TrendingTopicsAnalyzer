A UK sperm donor who says he's fathered 15 children did not explain to at least some of the mothers he has fragile X syndrome, an incurable genetic disease causing developmental delays and intellectual disability, according to court documents.  The 37-year-old man, James MacDougall, advertised himself as a private sperm donor to lesbian couples on Facebook. His condition would likely bar him from donating through a regulated bank. Now, MacDougall's application to a family court in Derby, UK, to spend time with some of his children — despite his original agreements of no contact — have been denied.
