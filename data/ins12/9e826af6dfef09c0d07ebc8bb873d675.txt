For the first time in three tries, Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady knows what it feels like to win 'The Match.'

This year's celebrity golf match featured Brady teaming up with Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who nailed his birdie putt on the 12th hole to beat the tandem of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen.

Filled with plenty of good-natured trash talk, the event raised money for various charitable organizations, giving these NFL MVP winners an opportunity to earn some bragging rights while supporting worthy causes.
