Ryan Wohl: Washington 38, Arizona 28
The University of Arizona was embarrassed last week during family weekend at Arizona Stadium against the University of Oregon. I believe this was quarterback Jayden de Laura's worst game at Arizona after only completing 24 of 42 passes with two turnovers. Arizona's defense has been very bad, particularly while defending the rush. They have allowed over 300 yards rushing in two out of their last three games.  If de Laura can play mistake free football and convert in the red zone, this game could be close at the end.
