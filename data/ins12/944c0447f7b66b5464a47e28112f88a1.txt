When Notre Dame hired Marcus Freeman to replace Brian Kelly there was an instant burst of energy fired through the program as well as the fan base that hadn't been felt in quite some time.  Despite all that excitement, Freeman has had his struggles on the job.
Notre Dame is just 3-3 halfway through this 2022 season which saw them ranked fifth nationally to start.  Sure, that was beyond Freeman's control as this team had more flaws than we probably wanted to admit in August and wasn't a realistic College Football Playoff contender, but 3-3 with losses to Marshall and Stanford, both of which haven't beaten any other FBS opponents besides Notre Dame, wasn't supposed to be in the cards either.
