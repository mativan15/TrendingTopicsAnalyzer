Our story on overcrowded housing involved dozens of interviews and visits to tightly packed apartments where COVID-19 ran rampant. We pored over historical books, scholarly journals, oral histories, census and public health data, archival city records and newspaper clippings.

In addition to the people struggling with overcrowding who are documented in the story, we want to give credit to the historians and researchers who were gracious enough to share their time and expertise.

For an overall look at overcrowded housing, we conducted several interviews with Dowell Myers, a professor of policy, planning and demography at USC and one of the preeminent experts on this topic.
