They say swimming and eating don't go. But that's not always the case. In Grovetown, a tight-knit community north of Blenheim, the school community is planning to use their old – and new – family recipes to get their children back in the water. Grovetown School has produced a cook book to help raise the $33,000 it needs to fix its quake-damaged, and leaking, pool. School principal Eve Sutherland, who started at the school a year ago, said they had to completely stop using the pool, which had been patched up several times since the 2016 earthquake.
