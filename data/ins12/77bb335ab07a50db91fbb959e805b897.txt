Twitter shareholders are suing Elon Musk and Twitter itself as they claim the billionaire manipulated the company's stock price downward in his $44 billion (€40 billion) takeover bid for the social media platform.The investors said the Tesla CEO saved himself $156 million (€145 million) by failing to disclose that he had purchased more than 5 per cent of Twitter by March 14. They asked to be certified as a class and to be awarded an unspecified amount of punitive and compensatory damages.They also named Twitter as a defendant, arguing the company had an obligation to investigate Musk's conduct, though they are not seeking damages from the firm.
