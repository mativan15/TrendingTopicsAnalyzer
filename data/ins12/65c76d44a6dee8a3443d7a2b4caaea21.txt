What qualifies you to hold this position? I'm a Bloomington resident for 22 years, with two college degrees in Social Work & Education. Prior to my 5 years as an elected Bloomington School Board member, I served as a leader in significant ways. Those who've seen my influential leadership in the community asked me to run, knowing that I research the issues and will advocate for all.

What would your top priorities be if elected? I will fight crime by upholding the rule of law and not allowing reduced charges and bail on repeat violent criminals by judges and county attorneys.
