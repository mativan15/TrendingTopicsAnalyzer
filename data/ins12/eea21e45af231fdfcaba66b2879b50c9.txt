Kelly Ripa called out Kathie Lee Gifford for commenting negatively about her new book when the former Live! host never actually read it. In fact, Ripa thinks Gifford wouldn't actually have a problem with what she said about Regis Philbin.

"I take his side... in most of the chapter," Ripa declared on Tuesday's episode of Dear Media's Not Skinny But Not Fat podcast.

Last week, Gifford said she's "not gonna read" Ripa's book Live Wire because of anecdotes the television personality made about Philbin.
