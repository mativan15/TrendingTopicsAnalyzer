Tennis motormouth Nick Kyrgios has pulled out of a potential boxing match with "dead broke" nemesis Bernard Tomic. A war of words between the two spanning years has reached its peak in recent weeks, with world number 417 Tomic first offering to take on Kyrgios in a $1 million tennis match to settle their feud.When Kyrgios showed little interest in this, Tomic then suggested a winner-takes-all boxing match with the same amount of money on the line.Yet Kyrgios isn't keen on that prospect either and claims to have "bigger fish to fry" than the man he has described as "the most hated athlete in Australia".
