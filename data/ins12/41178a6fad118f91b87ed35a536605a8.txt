MEMPHIS — Quentin Grimes' foot will keep him out of the opener.

While Obi Toppin practiced fully and is on track for Wednesday against the Grizzlies, Grimes was downgraded to out because of an injury the Knicks downplayed for weeks.

Although Tom Thibodeau denied a setback, the timeline of Grimes' recovery suggests something went wrong. He missed the first three preseason games with a 'sore left foot,' according to the Knicks, but returned to full practice by last week and logged 16 minutes in Friday's preseason finale.
