The Green Bay Packers have signed wide receiver Kawaan Baker to the practice squad, according to Matt Schneidman of The Athletic.
Baker was a seventh-round pick by the New Orleans Saints in 2021. He was waived on Monday after serving a six-game suspension for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances. Baker was reportedly having a solid training camp before the suspension and totaled four receptions for 44 yards in three preseason games.

As a rookie, Baker spent most of last season on the Saints practice squad but did play in two games.
