The Longhorns will continue their 2022 season on Saturday against the Iowa State Cyclones. Here is how to watch and listen.

The Texas Longhorns return home to continue Big 12 action when they host Iowa State at 11 a.m. Saturday at Darrell K. Royal Memorial Stadium in Austin, Texas.

The Longhorns (4-2, 2-1 in Big 12) are coming off an incredible 49-0 win over the Oklahoma Sooners in their annual rivalry game in Dallas. It was one of the most lopsided games in the rivalry's history. The Longhorns also ended OU's 167-game streak of scoring a touchdown, which was the longest active streak in the FBS.
