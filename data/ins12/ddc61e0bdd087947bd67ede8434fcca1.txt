Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next three days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date.
