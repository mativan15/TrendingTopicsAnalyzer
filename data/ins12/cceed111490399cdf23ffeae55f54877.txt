By Chris Wack American Rebel Holdings Inc. shares bounced back from Wednesday's 52-week low after the company said it expects to see third-quarter pro-forma gross revenue of $5 million, ahead of analysts' views. The stock, up 31% at 36 cents at 12:05 p.m. ET, hit its 52-week low of 23 cents Wednesday, and is down 94% year to date. The maker of safes and personal-defense products said revenue for third quarter, including only the revenue earned by Champion Safe Co. entities after the closing of its acquisition on July 29, would be nearly $4 million.
