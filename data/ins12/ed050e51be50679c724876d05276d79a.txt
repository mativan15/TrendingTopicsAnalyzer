How do you improve on one of the finest survival horror games ever made? That's the question facing the team at Capcom, many of whom worked on the original Resident Evil 4, as they tackle the remake for the PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC,"After [17 years], we too have gained a lot of knowledge about making games. We're now able to make games that are enjoyed on both a deeper and a broader level even when it comes to elements like controls and storytelling. We thought that adding this knowledge to Resident Evil 4 would make it an even more enjoyable title," says Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, who was the lead designer of the original game's cinematics and is now a producer of the remake.
