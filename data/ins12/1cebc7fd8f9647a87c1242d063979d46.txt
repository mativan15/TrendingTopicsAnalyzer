Minnesota fishing license sales have picked up after lagging in the season's early going, but the Department of Natural Resources continues to mark a downturn in participation when compared to the COVID-19 years of 2020 and 2021. DNR Fish and Wildlife Director Dave Olfelt said in an interview this week that undesirable weather, including floods, have been the primary turnoff. But it's also clear that Minnesota's collective impulse to fish over the past two years has faded as travel and leisure choices have multiplied, returning closer to normal, he said.
