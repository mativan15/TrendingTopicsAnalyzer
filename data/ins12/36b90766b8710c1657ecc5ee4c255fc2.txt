We have all seen how this sort of thing plays out. Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Diontae Johnson is far from the first player to sit out voluntary workouts in hopes of leveraging a new contract. But in the case of Johnson, he really does have nothing to gain and everything to lose.
Steelers writer Mark Kaboly has already put it out there that Johnson is unhappy that he doesn't have a contract extension yet. Johnson is heading into the final year of his rookie contract and doesn't want to go into the 2022 regular season without that financial security.
