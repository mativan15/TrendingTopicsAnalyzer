The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority says it doesn't have enough available trains to continue current rail service, bring back Yellow Line service and also launch new Silver Line service in time for Thanksgiving.

What's the holdup? According to Metro's CEO and general manager, Metro is awaiting two key approvals from the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission: the safety certification report of the Silver Line extension and a data-based report on Metro's 'Return to Service' plan for its 7000-series railcars, most of which are still out of commission after last October's derailment.
