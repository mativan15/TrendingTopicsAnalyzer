zoranm Morgan Stanley upgraded Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) to an Equalweight rating after having the household products stock slotted at Underweight. Analyst Dara Mohsenian and team like CLX as a positive earnings trade with clear EPS upside. The view is that Q1 gross margins may beat as the drag from higher input costs is more than offset by positive pricing. Clorox (CLX) is due to report earnings on November 1. The firm also sees underlying U.S. scanner data and retailer inventory cuts as both coming in better than CLX guidance and consensus expectations.
