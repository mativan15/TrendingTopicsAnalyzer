India is pushing for a valuation of around $7.7 billion for state-owned IDBI Bank Ltd. in what could be the biggest sale of the government's stake in a lender in decades, according to a person familiar with the matter. The government earlier this month invited bidders for a 60.72% stake in the Mumbai-listed lender. The valuation target means the administration is seeking a premium of roughly 33%, based on IDBI Bank's market value of about $5.8 billion as of Thursday close.

Shares of IDBI Bank rose as much as 3% on Friday after the Bloomberg News report.
