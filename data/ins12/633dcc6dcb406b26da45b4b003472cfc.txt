Businesses in Canada may be eligible to claim hundreds of dollars in credit card processing fees following a multimillion-dollar class action settlement with Visa and Mastercard. Merchants can now apply for rebates on so-called swipe fees charged on credit card transactions dating back two decades, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) said Monday. The settlement comes as the pandemic quickened a shift towards digital payments as more consumers shopped online. "During COVID, cash disappeared and everyone started paying with plastic," said Corinne Pohlmann, senior vice-president of national affairs at CFIB.
