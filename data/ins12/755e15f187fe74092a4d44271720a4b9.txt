The proposed settlement of more than $1 billion as compensation for the 98 people who died in a Florida condominium collapse is far from the largest in U.S. history. Even adding in the $96 million proposed for property owners in the Champlain Towers South disaster wouldn't bring it close to the biggest such legal deals. A judge gave initial approval to the deal on Saturday. Final approval is expected in the coming weeks for the settlements, which came out of lawsuits filed after the 12-story beachfront building tumbled down last June in Surfside.
