U.S. greenhouse gas industrial emissions rose during the first year of the Biden administration after declining for more than a decade, reflecting the economic rebound from the COVID-19 shutdown.

The Environmental Protection Agency released Monday the 2021 data from its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which showed that emissions from large industrial sources increased by 4.1% over 2020.

'As the United States makes strides to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address the climate crisis, good data are more important than ever,' said Joseph Goffman, EPA Office of Air and Radiation principal deputy assistant administrator.
