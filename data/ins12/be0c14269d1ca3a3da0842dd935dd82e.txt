The Chiefs will have a bit more cap space to work with over the rest of the 2022 season.

Field Yates of ESPN reports that the team has restructured tight end Travis Kelce‘s deal. Kelce converted base salary into a signing bonus in a move that has freed up $3.455 million in cap space for the AFC West club.

That money could be used for a trade deadline acquisition or free agent who the team believes can help their push for the postseason.
