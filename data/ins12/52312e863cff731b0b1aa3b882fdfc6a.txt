SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — After 54 holes of stroke play the field of 30 teams at the 2022 NCAA Div. I Men's Golf Championship is now down to 15 following the first cut on Sunday evening.

Oklahoma leads the way as the lone team under par at 1 under, four shots clear of in-state rivals Oklahoma State and six clear of third-place Vanderbilt. Seven of the teams to play in the morning wave on Sunday took advantage of the early conditions to solidify their spot inside the cut, leaving the rest of the field to duke it out for the final eight spots.
