INDIANAPOLIS, May 26 (Reuters) - For a long time motor racers stuck to their lanes, but increasingly drivers like Jimmie Johnson are heading in new directions in search of racing thrills.A seven-time NASCAR Cup champion, Johnson put down a well-beaten path to the stock car series winner's circle, but on Sunday he will take on the Brickyard's notorious oval for the first time in a bid to join AJ Foyt and Mario Andretti as the only drivers to win both the Indy and Daytona 500s.The pull of new adventures can bring purpose to accomplished drivers like the 46-year-old Johnson who is not viewing the Indy 500 as a one-off but a launch pad to a second career.
