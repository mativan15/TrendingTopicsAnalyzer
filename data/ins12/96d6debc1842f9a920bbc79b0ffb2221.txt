A $4.3 million confession of judgment signed by suspended and accused South Carolina attorney Richard 'Alex' Murdaugh may help fund a future charitable foundation to benefit Hampton County families in need.

Murdaugh has been indicted in a slew of criminal charges and sued in civil court in relation to an insurance fraud scheme involving his late housekeeper, Gloria Satterfield, who died in 2018 after an incident at his Colleton County estate, Moselle. During a December 2021 bond hearing following his arrest on that matter, among others, Murdaugh agreed to the judgment to benefit those particular victims.
