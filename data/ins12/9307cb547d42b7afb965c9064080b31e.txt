Auckland mayoral candidate Craig Lord believes the city's transport agency is deliberately creating congestion, as a means of getting people out of their cars. Lord told an online business audience he had a 'certified letter where the boss of AT [Auckland Transport] has said that at a meeting'. However when asked to supply the letter, which Lord became increasingly uncertain about when quizzed by media, he fell short of backing up his claim. Stuff asked Lord whether the letter was by AT's chief executive or about him.
