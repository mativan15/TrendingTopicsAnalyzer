Byju's has closed a financing round of $250 million from its existing investors, including Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), which led the round with over $100-150 million, people aware of the details told ET. It includes sale of secondary shares by existing investors of the edtech firm, they said.The primary fundraise was executed at its previous valuation of $22 billion while the secondary stake sale took place at a discounted price, said sources in the know. The deal, however, involves special liquidation preferences that have been handed out to these investors, making it different from a pure-play equity funding round.
