Despite Final Fantasy XVI being less than a year away, we've had surprisingly little news about it from Square Enix. Normally this would be cause for concern, but every time a trailer drops the game looks extremely impressive and this time is no different. This trailer is called 'Ambition' and shows us the five main factions that will come to blows during the story. It also gives us an estimated release date, although it's frustratingly vague.
We have the Grand Duchy of Rosaria, which seems to be your traditional fantasy kingdom, very traditional where the sun is always shining.
