Kia's Ceed has been with us for 13 years now, and to celebrate its third generation the company has refreshed its XCeed variant, which is a slightly jacked up version of the hatchback.To be honest, the changes are minor. It gets LED front lights, and a new grill and front bumper, plus a new rear diffuser and rear lights, but at a casual glance you probably wouldn't even notice it had changed.What is new is a plug-in hybrid version with a 1.6-litre petrol engine and a battery pack which together give it 139bhp.
