A mother of a  Jeffrey Dahmer  victim has slammed people dressing as the serial killer for Halloween. Some fans of the Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story  on Netflix are seemingly forgetting the terrifying true story behind the chart-topping programme and using Jeffrey as inspiration for their Halloween costumes. Online stores are reportedly seeing a surge in sales of Jeffrey-inspired outfits ahead of the spooky celebrations at the end of this month. Dahmer  horrifyingly murdered 17 young men and was sentenced to life in prison in 1992, but just two years later he was beaten to death in prison in 1994.
