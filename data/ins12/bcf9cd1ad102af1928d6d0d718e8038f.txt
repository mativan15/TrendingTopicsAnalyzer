Last month, we were able to sample the Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV, and found it didn't stray far from the formula Mercedes laid out with its EQS Sedan. It's still quite luxurious, comfortable, quiet and full of technology, but it's a little bigger and more capable. Also, being an SUV, we suspect it'll be quite a bit more popular than its sedan counterpart. Now, the German luxury brand is following that with the 2024 Mercedes-Benz EQE SUV, which is the next logical and predictable step in the rollout of the EQ lineup.
