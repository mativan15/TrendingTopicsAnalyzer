Go marvel! Situated above the Elizabeth Line, a stone's throw from Tottenham Court Road station, and looking on to Charing Cross Road and a new piazza that affords a joyous cut-through into Soho, @sohoplace is a West End theatre – the first of scale in 50 years – fit for the 21st century.
Sleek and glass-fronted, with swanky digital signage, it's as deluxe as a five-star hotel within, its decorative hallmark a twinkling line in astrological references. The amphitheatre at Epidaurus was a key inspiration for theatre-owner Nica Burns, working with architect Simon Allford.
