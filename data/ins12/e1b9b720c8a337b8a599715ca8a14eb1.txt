For many veterans, it can be tough to navigate life after the military.

Last year, Channel 9 talked to a veteran from Tega Cay who became a world record holder after climbing Denali. Now, one year later, he's started a small business with his wife.

Inside of Avalanche Coffee Company, Benjamin Breckheimer and his wife Mallory are brewing a new adventure.

'Now we're really busy, way busier than we were before,' they said.

Last Memorial Day, Benjamin set off to become a world record holder as the first Purple Heart veteran to reach all seven summits of the world -- the tallest peaks on each of the seven continents.
