May 29—MONROE TOWNSHIP — The first concert at Black Rock Adventure Park and Campground was held Saturday as organizers got their feet wet before another four concerts scheduled for Sunday.

Security was in place, dozens of Port-a-Potties lined the area and the tunes were blaring from Alice Sin as the Memorial Day weekend event got rolling late Saturday afternoon.

Melissa Light, co-owner of the park, said things were going well except the rain that fell Friday, and early Saturday, created some parking challenges.
