October 16, 2022 10:52 PM Eastern Daylight Time HONG KONG--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Over 3,200 tonnes of food are being dumped into landfills every day in Hong Kong, while one-fifth of Hongkongers live in poverty and face food insecurity. Local food bank Feeding Hong Kong invites the public to donate food to 13 business centre locations of Compass Offices in October to support the underprivileged and to echo the cause of World Food Day to mitigate food insecurity.



Food weighing more than 220 double-decker buses is being dumped into landfills daily, while so many are unable to get enough nutritious food.
