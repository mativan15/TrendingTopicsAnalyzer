Published: 08:44 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 08:54 EDT, 18 October 2022 Money expert Martin Lewis suggested hard-pressed Britons may have to ration energy after Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced that the planned two-year energy price freeze will end in six months. Analytics firms have predicted that annual energy bills could soar to over £5,000 and remain high for a 'sustained period' following yesterday's news that the £2,500 Energy Price Guarantee will cease at the end of April. As households and businesses come under mounting financial pressure, Mr Lewis called for more support for squeezed middle earners.
