There were times Max Presnell and Ken Callander - two doyens of Australian turf writing - were threatened with being warned off Royal Randwick because they had written articles seen as too critical of the old Australian Jockey Club.'Now they've rolled out the red carpet and named a race after us,' Presnell said.Ken Callander and Max Presnell have had a $1 million race named in their honour.The inaugural Callander-Presnell will be run at Randwick on Saturday, with the $1 million purse fitting for two mates who have seen their share of fast and slow horses and reported on countless quirky tales from the track, many of which were then re-told after deadline over a cold beer or eight at the Doncaster Hotel or the old Rusty Shovel at Kensington RSL.
