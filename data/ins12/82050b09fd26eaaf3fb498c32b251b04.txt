Kris Jenner has revealed she is planning to leave a very special gift for her children when she dies – necklaces made from her ashes.
The momager, 66, will no doubt be leaving her kids a pretty sizeable inheritance and business legacy too of course, but they'll likely get to keep a piece of her with them in the form of jewellery made from her remains, too.
Kris, who underwent hip replacement surgery on Thursday's episode of The Kardashians, revealed that her daughter Kim Kardashian had asked to keep the parts of bone that were removed by the surgeons.
