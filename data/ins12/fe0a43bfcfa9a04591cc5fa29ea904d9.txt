Paramount Global (PARA 4.66%) (PARA.A 3.90%), once an afterthought in the streaming market, received attention lately when it attracted investment from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Its streaming platform, Paramount+, uses a content library that could make it competitive.
Nonetheless, it falls well short of Netflix's (NFLX 1.98%) subscriber base. Even though Netflix has struggled recently with user base growth, Paramount might face significant challenges in taking its crown.
