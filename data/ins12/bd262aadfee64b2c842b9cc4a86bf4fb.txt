The Houston Astros' 18-inning, 1-0 win over the Seattle Mariners in Game 3 of the ALDS on Saturday tied an MLB record for the longest playoff game in history, and it would have gone longer if not for a solo shot by rookie shortstop Jeremy Peña that proved to be the game-winner.

Three postseason games previously went 18 innings, one of which—a 7-6 victory over the Atlanta Braves in Game 4 of the 2005 NLDS—involved the Astros. The other two were Game 3 of the 2018 World Series (Los Angeles Dodgers 3, Boston Red Sox 2), and Game 2 of the 2014 NLDS (San Francisco Giants 2, Washington Nationals 1).
