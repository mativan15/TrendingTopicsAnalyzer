A $400 million statewide package to expand broadband access in Maryland includes $6 million for the University of Maryland Extension (UME) to lead projects bolstering digital literacy among those previously bypassed by the modern internet. UME will focus on the adoption of broadband, with $4 million available for training, competency and education initiatives, and $2 million more to help people sign up for access and acquire a device. After the COVID-19 pandemic forced work, school and other aspects of our lives to move online, Maryland legislators learned that 23% of the state's households lacked broadband internet service.
