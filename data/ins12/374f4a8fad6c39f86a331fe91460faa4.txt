"A book is being written about the Prime Minister's time in office," chided British Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer earlier this week. "Apparently it's going to be out by Christmas. Is that the release date or the title?"Starmer's jab at British Prime Minister Liz Truss was way off. He picked the wrong holiday.Truss didn't even make it to Halloween.After 44 days at Number 10 Downing Street, Truss's tenure is the shortest of any modern British leader. George Canning served for only four months in 1827.
