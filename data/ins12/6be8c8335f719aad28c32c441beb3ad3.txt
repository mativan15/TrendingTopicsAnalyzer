It was a week of consolidation, in fact, a positive consolidation where the markets oscillated in a broad range. The Nifty saw itself trading in a 511-point range as compared to the 690-point range in the week before this. In the last five sessions, the benchmark index stayed in a broad 15,700-16,400 trading range but ended near the upper edge while it consolidated. Apart from this, the markets have stayed in this range for three weeks in a row now, and it is making visible attempts to inch higher.
