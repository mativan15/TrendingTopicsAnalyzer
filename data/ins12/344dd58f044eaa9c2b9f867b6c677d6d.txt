MADRID (AP) — Radamel Falcao converted a penalty kick two minutes into stoppage time as Rayo Vallecano pulled off a 1-1 draw with Atlético Madrid to end the rival's three-game winning streak in the Spanish league on Tuesday.

Falcao, a former Atlético player, struck the top of the net at the Metropolitano Stadium after a handball by José María Giménez inside the area.

'It feels like a victory,' Falcao said. 'We never gave up and kept pushing until the end and got rewarded with the goal.'

Álvaro Morata had opened the scoring in the 20th for Atlético, which was looking to move closer to Barcelona and Real Madrid at the top of the standings.
