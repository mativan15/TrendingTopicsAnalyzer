The city of Sacramento is offering money to filmmakers who want to make their projects in Sacramento.

Starting this week, the city's film and media office is taking applications for its film incentive program, now in its second year.

The first grant round closes on Jan. 15. This year there will be two rounds that award $10,000 grants to a total of six projects that will be filmed in the Sacramento region, and $5,000 grants to two projects that will complete the majority of their post-production locally.
