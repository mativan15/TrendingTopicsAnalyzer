Jason Isaacs has paid a unique tribute to his Harry Potter co-star Robbie Coltrane following the star's death on Friday aged 72.
The Lucius Malfoy actor said he found it ‘unbelievable' that the beloved Scottish performer even knew his name after looking up to him when he was younger.
Taking to Instagram, he uploaded a photo of his two daughters smiling and posing next to a strikingly lifelike rubber prosthetic head of Coltrane's, fashioned to look like his character, Hogwarts groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid.
