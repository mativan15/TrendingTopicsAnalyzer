Floyd Mayweather, 45, is more active than most elite boxers.
The Hall of Famer stopped Japanese MMA fighter Mikuru Asakura in the second round on Sept. 25, his second exhibition of the year. And he's not still not finished in 2022.
He's scheduled to face YouTuber-turned-boxer Deji Olantunji – known as 'Deji' – on pay-per-view Nov. 13 from Coca-Cola Arena in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
Mayweather and Deji, the brother of celebrity boxer KSI, were in Las Vegas for a new conference on Thursday.



'I'm just glad that we're able to come together and put another great event together for the fans,' Mayweather said.
