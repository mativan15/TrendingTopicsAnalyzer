Jeff Carter also scored against his old team and Ryan Poehling added his first career goal in the third period as Pittsburgh improved to 3-0-1.

Cal Petersen stopped just six of the nine shots he faced in the first period before being pulled at the start of the second. Jonathan Quick made 22 saves over the final two periods but Los Angeles saw its three-game winning streak snapped. Carl Grundstrom's power-play goal with 2:12 remaining spoiled Jarry's bid for his 12th career shutout.

The Penguins are off to a quick start thanks to some early dominance at PPG Paints Arena.
