By Chris Heaton-harris For The Daily Mail Published: 19:59 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 20:05 EDT, 21 October 2022 I've been in politics for a long time. I served as a Member of the European Parliament for ten years and have been a MP since 2010, and in my 22 years of elected politics I have met some of the best in the business.In that crowded field there has been one standout star – Boris Johnson.Whether it's stranded on a zip wire, delivering Brexit, supporting our country through Covid or leading the international effort to support Ukraine, there is no politician more able to rise up to whatever challenge he faces.
