OTTAWA - Canada is imposing more restrictions on Iranian officials with a focus on entities Ottawa is linking to propaganda and torture.

The new sanctions target six people and four entities, including the Fars News Agency, which is believed to be affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Also sanctioned is Iran's Guardian Council, which blocks electoral candidates who don't align with the regime's ideology.

Among the entities barred from doing business with Canada is the Assembly of Experts and the Expediency Discernment Council, both of which uphold the regime's rules.
