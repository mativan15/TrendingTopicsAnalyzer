Dyson's Airwrap Complete Styler has been regularly selling out ever since it launched in 2018, and its popularity doesn't show any signs of waning. In fact, it's been nearly impossible to get your hands on one over the past six months. But today, you can find the Airwrap in stock on the brand's site—with a whole host of upgrades and new features. That's right, the next generation of the cult-favorite multi-styler has officially launched, and we have a feeling it'll sell out within minutes. You can find the new Dyson Airwrap Multi-Styler in stock on the brand's site today.
