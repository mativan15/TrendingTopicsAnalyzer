A day after around 77 trees and 57 branches were uprooted in a storm, New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) member Kuljeet Chahal recommended the formation of a ‘quick response team' to study the causes and provide solutions to such incidents in future.
Chahal discussed with chairman Bhupinder Singh Bhalla an action plan to compensate for the damages in the NDMC area. He also asked the NDMC chief to start a compensatory plantation drive by planting 10 trees in affected areas.
