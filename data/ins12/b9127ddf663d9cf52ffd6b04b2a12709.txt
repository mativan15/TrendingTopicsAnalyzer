Improved safety measures in online gambling in the UK have knocked betting company 888's revenue by 7% in the last three months, the company has revealed.

The Gambling Commission introduced a raft of new measures last summer, including the introduction of limits on spin speeds, and the permanent ban on features that speed up play or celebrate losses as wins.

As a result, the average spend per player for 888's UK online customers was down 14% year-on-year, it said.
