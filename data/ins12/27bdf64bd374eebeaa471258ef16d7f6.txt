LIV Golf recruit Sergio Garcia said his days on the European Tour could be over on Saturday after he was fined by the circuit for pulling out of a tournament.

The 2017 Masters champion and Ryder Cup stalwart said he felt "more welcomed and loved" on Saudi-funded LIV, where he has been one of the star attractions in its debut season.

Spain's Garcia, 42, was reportedly fined by the European Tour for failing to medically explain his withdrawal from last month's BMW PGA Championship after an opening round of 76.
