When Lew Finfer's daughter, Sophia, was 5, someone asked her if she knew what her father did for a living. 'He's a community agonizer,' she said.Nearly three decades later, her answer lives on as both a family joke and an apt description of Finfer's career as a community organizer. Because anyone who does it knows the job of organizing people around a common cause can also require a great deal of agonizing to make that happen.At the end of the year, Finfer, 72, is leaving his post as senior issues adviser at Massachusetts Communities Action Network — a group he led as director from 1985 to 2021.
