Tripura's royal scion Pradyot Kishore Debbarma on Thursday claimed that he is ready to die if that brings any good to the state's indigenous people. Pradyot is the head of the TIPRA Motha party that has been in power in Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) since last year. His statement came in the backdrop of a video floating around in which some alleged Bharatiya Janata Party members raised the slogan ‘Death to Pradyot' in Ampinagar of Gomati district, over 60 km from state capital Agartala.
