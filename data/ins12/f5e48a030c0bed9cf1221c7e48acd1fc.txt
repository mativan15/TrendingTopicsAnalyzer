It once looked as if Josh Allen (the pass rusher, not the quarterback) would be coming to the Giants. He never did. On Sunday, though, Allen (the pass rusher) will be coming for the Giants.
Entrusted with the task of stopping him: Evan Neal and Andrew Thomas, the two young offensive tackles. Allen, Neal and Thomas are all former first-round draft picks, taken within the top seven selections in their respective drafts. Add in the outside linebacker on the other side, Travon Walker (the No. 1 pick in 2021) and this should definitely be considered a high-class confrontation set to go down Sunday when the Giants face the Jaguars in Jacksonville.
