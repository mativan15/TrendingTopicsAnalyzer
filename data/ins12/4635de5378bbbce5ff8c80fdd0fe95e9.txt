The stage has been set for a grand push to Mission LiFE as Prime Minister Narendra Modi was joined by United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres at Gujarat's Kevadia for a mega event on Thursday. Considering this was the UNSG's first India visit during his second term, it attests to the mission's global appeal.
From now on, Mission LiFE will be India's signature initiative at the UN and other international platforms for showcasing climate action and early achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
