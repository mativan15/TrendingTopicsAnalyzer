The University Science Instrumentation Centre (USIC) located on the North Campus of Delhi University announced on May 1 a list of charges for laboratory instruments to be used by science PhD students. The students are now expected to bear expenses incurred while performing experiments as part of their research. The charges range from Rs 150 per sample for electron microscope scanning to Rs 500 per hour for modulated differential scanning.
The students were taken aback when they were handed the rate cards.
