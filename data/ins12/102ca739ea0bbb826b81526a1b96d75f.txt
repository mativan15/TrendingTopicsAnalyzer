Oregon State University has collected a generous gift from donors who hope to bolster the school's climate science, oceanography, sustainability and water resources research.

Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang gave the school $100 million that will go toward a $200 million research and education center. The complex, which will be called the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Collaborative Innovation Complex, will support research in artificial intelligence, materials science and robotics.

The gift arrives as business leaders, educators and lawmakers attempt to collect more investments, be it money or land or intellectual capital, for the state's semiconductor sector.
