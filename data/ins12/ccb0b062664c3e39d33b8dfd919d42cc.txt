MAINZ, Germany (AP) — Five different players scored for Mainz as it routed 10-man Cologne 5-0 to strengthen its bid for the European places in the Bundesliga on Friday.

Mainz achieved its biggest margin of victory for nearly three years and soared from 11th to third in the table.

Cologne dropped two places to ninth.

Cologne defender Luca Kilian hauled down Mainz forward Karim Onisiwo on the break to give away an 11th-minute penalty converted by Marcus Ingvartsen. Kilian soon fouled Onisiwo again to earn himself a second yellow card and his second sending-off in 10 league games this season.
