General Motors' family of full-electric pickup trucks has a new member with Thursday afternoon's announcement of the new 2024 GMC Sierra EV. The new Sierra EV joins the current GMC Hummer EV and upcoming Chevrolet Silverado EV models and is expected to hit the road next year starting with the well-appointed and premium-priced Denali Edition 1.As is the case with the combustion-powered Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado 1500, the Sierra EV shares its body with the battery-electric Silverado EV and, so, boasts a largely identical silhouette and flanks.
