Halloween events have proved to be monstrously popular at Orlando's theme parks, prompting fans to spend hundreds of dollars for tickets to be frightened and/or delighted.

That wasn't always the case. Walt Disney World's first haunted celebration at Magic Kingdom was actually before its second-ever Halloween in 1972, when it promoted free admission for paying park visitors to get into its Haunted Mansion attraction, no E ticket necessary. SeaWorld Orlando also had modest promotions its opening year in 1973, when it gave pumpkins to children in attendance.
