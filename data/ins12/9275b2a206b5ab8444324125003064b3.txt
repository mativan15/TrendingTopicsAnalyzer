The best smartwatches for cycling are becoming ever more sophisticated. Even the mid-range ones are starting to outperform some of the best cycling computers: not only do they have the same level of functionality and post-ride data analysis but because they're on your wrist they can be smarter, tracking what's going on with your body when you're off the bike as well as on it.

Because they're on your wrist they'll track pretty much any sport you do, whether that's running, swimming, hiking, rowing, skiing or even golfing! You don't need a bike mount (although that's an option with some) and don't need to worry about removing it from your bike when you stop.
