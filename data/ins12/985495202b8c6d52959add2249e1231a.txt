Zak Surety is back on tour after coming through Q School, but his battle with anxiety is as big a challenge as any opponent he will face on the professional circuit.
The 30-year-old won through the second event this season thanks to beating talented Belgian teenager Ben Mertens in the final round, making it the second time he has been through Q School to earn his place on tour.
The Basildon-based player admits that the spectre of the brutal tournament in Sheffield has been looming large in his mind ever since he came through it two years ago.
