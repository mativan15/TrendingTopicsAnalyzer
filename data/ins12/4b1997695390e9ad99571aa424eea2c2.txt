The Philadelphia 76ers are set on leaving the Wells Fargo Center, and team owners say they've had discussions about bringing the Flyers with them.

The Sixers have proposed the development of a $1.3 billion Center City arena at the current site of the Fashion District on Market Street, where they plan to move the team after its lease at the Wells Fargo Center expires in 2031.

New Sixers part-owner David Adelman said Friday that the group has entered into talks about their plans with the brass at Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA), which owns the Wells Fargo Center and the Flyers.
