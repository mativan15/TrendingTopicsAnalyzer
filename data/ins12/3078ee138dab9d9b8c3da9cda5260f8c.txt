At the time Rachel and her husband were already empty nesters, but the whole family became involved in the mother and son challenge. Louis's three siblings found it 'hilarious', while his father – who works in healthcare – spent hours training his wife and son. 'He was really dedicated to the cause from the outset,' says Rachel. 'He'd fire questions at us and we'd practice quizzing. Which isn't actually that unusual for a family dinner at my house.'
Throughout the process, Rachel had expected Louis to be the one to make it onto the team while she'd 'fall at the first hurdle', but in the end, they both made it through to the televised match, which will be shown on BBC Two, Monday 17 October.
