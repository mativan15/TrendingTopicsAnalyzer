The High Court of Karnataka has adjourned to June 27 the hearing of a petition challenging the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe into former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi video leak extortion case. After the sexual assault case against Jarkiholi, the former minister filed a counter- complaint against the alleged victim and others alleging extortion. He had claimed a fake CD was made to blackmail him. The alleged victim in the issue had filed the petition before the High Court challenging the SIT probe based on Jarkiholi's complaint.
