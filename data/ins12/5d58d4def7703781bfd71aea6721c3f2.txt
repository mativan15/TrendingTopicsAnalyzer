Late Thursday, the once-mighty cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which reported a 4,900% increase in profits in 2021, announced that it was pausing hiring 'for the foreseeable future' because of the current market conditions. And while pausing hiring may be one thing, the company then decided to be the biggest of assholes, saying that it would rescind job offers from people who had already accepted them but had not yet started to work.L.J. Brock, Coinbase's chief people officer, explained in a blog post that 'a number' of affected individuals would be informed via email that they no longer had a job waiting for them.
