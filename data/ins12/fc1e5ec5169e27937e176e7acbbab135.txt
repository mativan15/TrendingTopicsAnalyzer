Six years after the end of Key & Peele and two years since the release of their movie Keanu, comedic duo Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele got back together in a studio for Wendell & Wild, the stop-motion animated movie from The Nightmare Before Christmas director Henry Selick.

They saw each other for about 4 hours that first session as they began work recording the voices for the titular brother demons, Wendell (Key) and Wild (Peele), who trick an Afro-punk teen orphan, Kat (Lyric Ross), to summon them up to the land of the living.
