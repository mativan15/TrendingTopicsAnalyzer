Gov. Ron DeSantis and his allies are issuing edicts and passing laws to prohibit schools from teaching whatever might make a student feel 'discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin.' This includes teaching about social justice and fostering social-emotional skills.

This is absurd. It is impossible to teach about American history and culture without teaching about social justice. Without social justice movements, the American revolution never would have happened.
