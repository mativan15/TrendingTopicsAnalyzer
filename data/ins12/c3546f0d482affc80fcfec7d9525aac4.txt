Student borrowers have enjoyed a pause on their federal student loan payments since March 2020.

The federal government released a preliminary application form for its mass student debt cancellation plan late Friday night.

Borrowers can submit their applications, but they won't be processed until later this month. The application is available here, though the agency said it would pause the site periodically for maintenance.

'This testing period will allow the Department to monitor site performance through real-world use, test the site ahead of the official application launch, refine processes, and uncover any possible bugs prior to official launch,' an Education Department spokesperson said.
