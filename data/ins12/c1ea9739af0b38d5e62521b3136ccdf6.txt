Two fast-growing private jet operators placed orders with Textron Aviation yesterday in Orlando, Florida. The separate announcements by FlyExclusive and Fly Alliance took place during the National Business Aviation Association's Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition being held here. They came within hours of French billionaire Bernard Arnault saying he sold a jet he owned and will now rent private airplanes, specifically so his movements can't be tracked on social media platforms like Twitter.
