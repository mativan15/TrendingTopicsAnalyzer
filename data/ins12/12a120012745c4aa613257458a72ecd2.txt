The Hurricanes are back at Hard Rock Stadium, where the home crowd for Miami's 12:30 p.m. kickoff Saturday against Duke will want to enjoy a game without having it go down to the last few minutes — that is, if the nine-point-favorite Canes are ahead at that point.

The Blue Devils (4-3, 1-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) have lost each of their past two games by three points, including last week's 38-35 heartbreaker in which North Carolina scored with 16 seconds left on a touchdown that was reviewed at length because the receiver appeared to step out of bounds before the catch.
