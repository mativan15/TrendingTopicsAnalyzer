AgenciesThere has been speculation about Lionel Messi returning to Barcelona as he comes to the final year of his contract at Paris Saint-Germain Football Club (PSG). Ronald Araujo has sent a transfer message to Barcelona and said he would sign Messi if he were the sporting director at Barcelona. Araujo was a Barcelona player who saw Messi leave the club. He hopes the Argentine legend will return to Barcelona once his PSG contract expires. Barcelona faces Real Madrid on Sunday, and all eyes will be on El Clasico.
