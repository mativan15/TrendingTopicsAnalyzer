Big Story 
All arrangements are complete for voting day, according to Congress election chief Madhusudan Mistry. Meanwhile, starkly different emotions were on display in the campaign teams of Mallikarjun Kharge and Shashi Tharoor. On one side was supreme confidence and on the other, cautious optimism. The party is set to vote today to elect its next president — its first non-Gandhi chief in close to 25 years. 
The CBI has summoned Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia to join its investigation into the AAP government's  now-scrapped excise policy at 11 am Monday.
