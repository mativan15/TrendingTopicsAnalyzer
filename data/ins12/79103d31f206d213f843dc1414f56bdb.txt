Shares of Salesforce (CRM 4.27%) were up as much as 7.5% at the market open this morning after news that value-investment firm Starboard Value LP had acquired a stake in the company. As of 11:42 a.m. ET, the stock was holding a 3.4% gain on the day so far, outperforming the blue chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Data by YCharts.
Market sentiment has turned the corner after a brutal sell-off last week. But the Starboard news could be a strong signal to investors that Salesforce is starting to reach value territory after falling 40% year to date.
