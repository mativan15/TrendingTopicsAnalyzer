India's forex reserves spiked for the first time snapping nine consecutive shrinkages. The forex kitty increased by $4.2 billion to $597.5 billion for the week ended May 20, show latest data from the Reserve Bank of India, which is aiming to retain the $600 billion mark amid current global uncertainties. 'The central bank may have received dollars against its long forwards, which in turn aided the forex reserves to increase,' said Anindya Banerjee, currency analyst at Kotak Securities. There is no reason to believe that RBI has recently bought it from the spot market amid a falling rupee.
