Published: 02:10 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 02:10 EDT, 18 October 2022 Multicultural communities caught in Victoria's unfolding floods crisis are at risk of more harm from a shortfall in support, experts say. There have been reports of delayed assistance in Shepparton for multicultural groups, due to a lack of language translation services within Victoria's State Emergency Service. The Ethnic Communities' Council of Victoria is calling on the state government to advance its emergency management outcomes for marginalised groups, arguing they are disproportionately affected by emergencies and disasters.
