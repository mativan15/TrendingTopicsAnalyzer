A UK-based climate activist group's protest against government plans to issue new oil licenses has triggered commuter chaos for the second day in a row, reported local media Tuesday.
Protesters identifying with the Just Stop Oil coalition climbed the Queen Elizabeth II bridge in Dartford, following which the bridge was closed. The closure resulted in at least two hours of delay during Monday's rush hour, with nearly 10 km-long traffic jams on the bridge, said a report in the UK-based Guardian, citing the National Highways.
