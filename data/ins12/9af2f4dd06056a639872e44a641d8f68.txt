Newly promoted Nottingham Forest are considering a large bid for Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope, according to reports.

Pope, 30, suffered relegation with the Clarets last season but was highly regarded as one of the Premier League's best shot-stoppers during his time in the top flight.

He is keen to continue playing Premier League football next season and Burnley will listen to offers for the Englishman, but are thought to be demanding £40m for his services.

According to The Sun, Forest will attempt to sign Pope but they are not willing to pay that much, with a deal in the region of £10m set to be proposed to Burnley.
