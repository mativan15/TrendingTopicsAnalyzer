Long Shadows

By David Baldacci

Grand Central, 432 pages, $37

This is David Baldacci's 51st crime book overall, his seventh featuring Amos Decker, the FBI agent with the spookily phenomenal memory. Events find Decker in the bureau's very bad books. He dresses too casually for his spic-and-span bosses, doesn't mask his contempt for their by-the-book methods, is annoyingly successful for a guy who works investigative unorthodoxy for all its worth. In the new book, Decker is assigned to the murder of a Naples, Florida, judge (female) and her bodyguard (male).
