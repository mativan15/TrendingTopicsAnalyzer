A High Court has released a ruling which says outgoing speaker Trevor Mallard was 'unreasonable' and 'irrational' for trespassing former deputy minister Winston Peters from Parliament, just hours before he is due to make his valedictory speech. Incoming speaker Adrian Rurawhe apologised on his second day in the job in August, when he admitted that the exercise of power to issue Peters a warning under section 4 of the Trespass Act 1980 was 'unreasonable and irrational'. But the High Court released its ruling on Thursday, before Mallard was due to address MPs after a decades-long stint in Parliament which started as an MP in 1984.
