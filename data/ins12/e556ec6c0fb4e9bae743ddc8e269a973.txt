Tracy Slocum can't disclose whether her Latham business Pretty Rugged got a deal on "Shark Tank" before the show airs on ABC, but there a few things we already know about what we'll see and what the stakes are for entrepreneurs who get on the national TV program.

The episode will air locally on WTEN-Channel 10 at 8 p.m. on Oct. 21.

Publicity information released by ABC identifies the four regular "Sharks" who will be on the panel: Mark Cuban, Robert Herjavec, Kevin O'Leary and Lori Greiner.

There's also a guest "Shark" — Emma Grede.
