Callon (CPE) shares fell 8.0% Thursday, even as energy commodity prices rose; shares in other energy producers fell less than 1.0% on average.
Ahead of the market open Thursday, a block of 6.5m shares traded (~10% of shares outstanding) at a 7.1% discount to Wednesday's close.
The block traded via Credit Suisse; however, details of the buyer and seller are not known.
Callon (CPE) could also face a windfall tax headwind, as the White House looks into recently proposed legislation on the matter.
