Ever wondered how to get a leg-up in your career with zero connections in your field?

That's the problem Ten Thousand Coffees (10KC), a Canadian-founded networking company, wants to solve. And the company has just received a major boost of $75 million from U.S. private equity firm, Five Elms Capital — the first institutional investment since the company's formation in 2014 — to expand its operations and reach.

'This is a critical move to expand our business and ensure the democratization process when it comes to new hires and promotions,' said Dave Wilkin, CEO and co-founder of 10KC.
