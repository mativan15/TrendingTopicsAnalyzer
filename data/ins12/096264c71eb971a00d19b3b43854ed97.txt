Most of the reported losses ($575M) involved bogus crypto investment scams, the FTC said, adding that one out of every four dollars lost to fraud was paid in crypto. The next largest losses reported by consumers were on so-called "romance scams," which involve a love interest who tries to tempt someone into investing in a hidden crypto scam, the government agency noted.
