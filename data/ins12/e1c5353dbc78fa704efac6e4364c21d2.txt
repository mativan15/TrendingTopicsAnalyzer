Maharashtra government's town planning authority, the City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO), has transferred around 2,244 acres of land under mangroves to the forest department of the state government. Out of the total land parcels, nearly 690 acres of land is in the possession of CIDCO, and it has given no objection to the balance of 1,554 acres in the CIDCO area under mangroves. The remaining land covered by mangroves is private, and hence, needs no objection. Maharashtra's minister of environment Aditya Thackeray, in the meeting held on April 18, gave instructions to CIDCO regarding the transfer of this land under the mangrove to the forest department.
