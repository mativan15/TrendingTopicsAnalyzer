LONDON — An unwanted invitation to a private trip to Gibraltar. An attempted kiss after a work-related dinner.

These were among the complaints that led to the resignation of a British lawmaker on Friday after a report from a parliamentary watchdog found him guilty of sexual misconduct toward a junior staff member.

The findings against the lawmaker, Christian Matheson, who represents Chester in northwest England for the opposition Labour Party, were the latest in a series of accusations of misogynistic behavior and sexual harassment that have dogged Britain's Parliament.
