SAN DIEGO (CNS) - A former San Diego resident who helped fund the travel of North Americans who fought overseas for ISIS was sentenced Monday to 20 years in federal prison. Abdullahi Ahmed Abdullahi, 37, pleaded guilty last year to federal charges stemming from his financial assistance of six Americans and Canadians who traveled to Syria to engage in "armed battles to gain control of the territories and civilian populations within Syria" on behalf of ISIS, according to prosecutors. All six of those individuals died, including Douglas McClain, another former San Diego resident who is believed to be the first American to die while fighting for ISIS.
