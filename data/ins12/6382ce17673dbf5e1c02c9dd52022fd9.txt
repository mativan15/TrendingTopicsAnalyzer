A crypto-currency exchange bought this year's Eurovision crystal mic trophy from Kalush Orchestra, the Ukrainian rap-folk band that won the competition, to help it raise funds for their country's fight against the Russian military.

Estonian crypto exchange WhiteBit, which is ranked 19 out of 624 on trust score by industry tracker CoinGecko, bought the trophy for $900,000 in an auction held on Instagram over the weekend. Oleh Psiuk, Kalush Orchestra's lead singer, also sold his signature pink hat for 11 million hryvnia ($374,000).
