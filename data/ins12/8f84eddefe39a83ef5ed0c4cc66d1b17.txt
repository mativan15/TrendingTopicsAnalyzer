One year after the on-set death of Halyna Hutchins, Alec Baldwin's Western movie Rust is set to be completed in the near future.

Cinematographer Hutchins, 42, was shot and killed Oct. 21, 2021, after a prop gun held by Baldwin that turned out to contain live rounds discharged. Director Joel Souza was also wounded in the incident, and Baldwin maintains that he did not pull the trigger.
