The return of DE Jadeveon Clowney to the Cleveland Browns was a huge signing both literally and figuratively. The 6'5″ long-armed defender is a great fit opposite (or beside) fellow edge rusher Myles Garrett.
Without Clowney, the Browns would be scrapping together a defensive end rotation with just Chase Winovich, Curtis Weaver and rookies Alex Wright and Isaiah Thomas.
Instead, Cleveland slots Winovich in as their primary pass rush substitute and gives the other three a chance to carve out a role for themselves without as much at stake.
