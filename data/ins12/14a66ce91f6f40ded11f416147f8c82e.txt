Enbridge Inc. bolstered by acquisition of pipeline companies

Enbridge Inc.'s stock continues to hold strong amid an energy crisis in Europe that's pushing oil and gas prices through the roof.

The multinational pipeline company, headquartered in Calgary, owns and operates pipelines throughout Canada and the U.S. transporting crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.

With projects secured under a $13 billion program focusing primarily on the expansion of gas pipelines as well as gas distribution storage and renewable power, Enbridge is expanding the scale of its energy portfolio, said Michael R.
