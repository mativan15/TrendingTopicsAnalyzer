The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and SHOWTIME launched a $250,000 fund to support eligible LGBTQ+ small businesses, called 'Queer to Stay.'

Businesses can apply and must show how they serve their local LGBTQ+ communities and how COVID-19 has impacted them.

'Queer to Stay' comes at the onset of Pride Month, which takes place in June.

Small businesses that serve the LGBTQ+ community are getting a financial boost as the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) launched its 'Queer to Stay' initiative for the third consecutive year, right in time for Pride Month.
