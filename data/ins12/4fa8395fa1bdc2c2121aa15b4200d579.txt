The FTSE 100 has performed better than most global stock markets this year, but it has still fallen sharply. Trading at just over 6,900, it is down almost 8% in 2022.

This has been a tough year. The global economy had barely started to recover from the pandemic, when Putin invaded Ukraine.

Energy prices have rocketed, while inflation is in double digits. The era of cheap money has hit an abrupt close, as stimulus goes into reverse. All the froth has gone out of stock markets, and house prices may soon start falling.
