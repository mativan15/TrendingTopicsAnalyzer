Ian Blackford says Tory prime ministers have ‘collectively got us into this mess'

Ian Blackford has called for a general election as he claimed that the financial competence of the UK Government has been "put to bed" after Kwasi Kwarteng was fired as chancellor.

The SNP party's Westminster leader said Tory prime ministers since 2010 have 'collectively got us into this mess'.

Prime Minister Liz Truss sacked Mr Kwarteng and replaced him with former secretary Jeremy Hunt.

Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland on Saturday, Mr Blackford branded the situation a 'shambles'.
