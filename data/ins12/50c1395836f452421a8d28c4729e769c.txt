Pakistan will manage to raise the roughly $34 billion it expects to need in external financing in the 2023 financial year, the finance minister said on Wednesday, after a credit rating agency this month downgraded it citing external vulnerability risks. Pakistan's economy, already in turmoil, has been badly hit by devastating floods this monsoon season which are estimated to have caused over $30 billions in losses. Moody's cut Pakistan's sovereign credit rating on Oct. 6 by one notch to Caa1 from B3, citing increased government liquidity and external vulnerability risks following the floods, in a move strongly contested by the Pakistani government.
