'Celebrity Jeopardy!' had a hilariously awkward moment when Marvel star Simu Liu poked fun at actor Ike Barinholtz's answer to a question about Filipinos.

Liu, 33, faced off against Barinholtz, 45, and comedian Iliza Shlesinger, 39, during the first-ever semifinals of 'Celebrity Jeopardy!' on Sunday.

During the show, the contestants were given the clue 'October is the history month for this Asian American ethnic group that includes Olivia Rodrigo and Jo Koy,' prompting Barinholtz to answer, 'What are Filipinos?'

Although show host Mayim Bialik awarded Barinholtz money for his question, Liu found an opportunity to tease the 'Suicide Squad" actor.
