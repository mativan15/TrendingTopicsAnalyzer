LEO PERCOVICH feels his caretaker spell in charge of Middlesbrough has helped put the club back on the right track – and is hoping for further progress when the Championship's bottom club, Huddersfield Town, visit the Riverside tomorrow afternoon.

Percovich, who is leading a temporary coaching team that now comprises Craig Liddle, Mark Tinkler and Grant Leadbitter, will take charge of his fifth game as interim boss tomorrow, with his record so far showing two wins and two defeats.
