'It's been a great journey,' KK said with a smile when we sat down for an interview in 2016 at the Hindustan Times Mumbai office. The singer had completed two decades in the Hindi film industry. Edited excerpts from the interview: You've sang a lot for films. What's your career plan going forward? When you sing others musicians' tunes for 20 years, you tend to get lost as a musician. Now, I feel like exploring myself more as an independent musician. When you have done a lot of good work, there comes a point when you want to utilise the experience you have garnered to better yourself and your music.
