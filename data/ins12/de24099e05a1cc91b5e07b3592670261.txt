BERKELEY — A fresh game plan has emerged that would rescue a key section of the historic California Theater in Berkeley and build a brand-new residential tower and live-performance venue at that site, city documents show.
An updated proposal shows how a housing tower might look when it sprouts behind the existing facade and marquee of the 108-year-old movie complex and how the front of the cinema palace would be salvaged and retained.
More than 200 apartments are being eyed as part of the development, which would rise at 2113 Kittredge St.
