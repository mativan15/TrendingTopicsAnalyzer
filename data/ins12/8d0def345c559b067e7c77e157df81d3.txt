The Congress on Wednesday said the Enforcement Directorate (ED) summoned its president Sonia Gandhi and Lok Sabha MP Rahul Gandhi to appear before it on June 8 in connection with a money laundering case related to the National Herald newspaper. The Opposition party hit out at the BJP-led Central government, accusing it of indulging in cheap vendetta politics to divert attention from issues such as inflation, falling GDP growth, social unrest, and social divisiveness in the country.
The Congress said the summons was received 'just a few days ago' and Sonia would '100 per cent' appear before the ED.
