Concept of VR government service at GITEXGITEX 2022 was the biggest it has ever been — in fact it was the biggest tech event the world had ever seen. There were '4,500 companies and 100,000-plus attendees from 170 countries, spanning 26 halls and two million sq. ft., matching the scale of 33 football fields.' This took comfort shoes to a whole new level — understandably sneakers were the fashion choice of the majority of the attendees. The event was packed with talks in every hall and vendors showcased the latest in all things cybersecurity, metaverse, AI, cloud computing, materials science, fintech and the much talked about Web 3.
