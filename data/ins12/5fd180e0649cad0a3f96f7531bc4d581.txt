AgenciesRepresentative ImageMumbai Police on Friday detained eight Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) workers who were allegedly distributing party chief Raj Thackeray's letter over loudspeaker row in the Chembur area here. In the letter, Raj Thackeray urged people to report to the local police if permissible decibel limits for loudspeakers are violated in the city. The controversy started after Thackeray on April 12 gave an ultimatum to the Maharashtra government to remove loudspeakers from mosques by May 3, failing which, he warned, MNS workers will play Hanuman Chalisa on loudspeakers.
