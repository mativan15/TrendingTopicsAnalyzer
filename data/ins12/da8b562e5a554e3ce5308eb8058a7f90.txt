This State is now one of the most coffee-obsessed in Europe — more than three-quarters of Irish consumers drink coffee each day, according to industry research. If a construction worker wielding a breakfast roll personified a certain view of the economy in the Celtic Tiger boom, then an office or tech worker clutching a flat white may be a more accurate view of the economy in 2022.If politicians ever wanted to discommode Irish consumers, they need only mess with their daily cuppa. The planned 20 cent 'latte levy' on all single use takeaway coffee cups, as part of a drive to force people to use their own 'keep cups' instead, will put Government environmental policy quite literally into the hands of the majority of Irish consumers.
