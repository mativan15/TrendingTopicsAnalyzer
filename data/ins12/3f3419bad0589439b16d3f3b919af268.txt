Paris-based Prime Entertainment Group has confirmed sales for two programs from its catalog of Hollywood- and celeb-centered titles.

Hollywood on Set (52 x 26 min.), which takes viewers behind the scenes of some of Tinseltown's biggest blockbusters, has been sold to NBCUniversal's film-centered specialty channel Studio Universal for Africa, with a premiere set for early 2023.

'It is a true pleasure to reinforce our presence in Africa and to see our cinema-related series do so well on major channels such as Studio Universal,' said Alexandra Marguerite, head of sales for Prime Entertainment Group.
