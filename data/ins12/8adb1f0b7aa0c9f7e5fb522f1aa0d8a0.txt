A pair of key Patriots players still have a chance to play on Sunday.

A day prior to their Week 6 matchup against the Browns, the Patriots ruled out a pair of key players who were listed as questionable for Sunday's game, but they didn't rule out two of their most important players, either.

Starting corner Jonathan Jones (ankle) and wide receiver Nelson Agholor (hamstring) were both ruled out for Sunday's game.

Starting quarterback Mac Jones and running back Damien Harris weren't, though. In fact, Jones made the trip to Cleveland as the Patriots are indicating that he could still play, Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer reported.
