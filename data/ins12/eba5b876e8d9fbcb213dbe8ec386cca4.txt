'Perth has experienced a smaller cycle in the post-pandemic period than much of the rest of the country.'However, it is still experiencing growth, by contrast to the large cities on the east coast.'Regardless, like the rest of the country, Perth has seen a slowdown in growth in 2022 as expectations for interest rates have increased significantly.'Ryan said he expected the Perth market to experience a period of modest growth due to increasing inflation and further rate rises.'There is some divergence between financial markets, which are pricing in further hikes of more than 2 percentage points in 2022, and major bank forecasters, who believe rates will be closer to 1 percentage points higher at the end of the year,' he said.
