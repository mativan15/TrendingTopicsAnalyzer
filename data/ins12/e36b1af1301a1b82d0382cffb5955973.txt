A Dayton-region manufacturing giant has expanded its executive leadership team this week. The new additions to the employee-owned company come during a period of continued growth.

Henny Penny has announced the appointment of Suresh Iyer as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Laurie Neff as Chief Customer Experience Officer (CXO).

In the past year, the booming Eaton-based company has welcomed a chief people officer, announced a satellite office location in downtown Dayton, and grown its workforce by nearly 20%.
