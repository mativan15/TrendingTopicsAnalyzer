US stocks bounced on Monday morning ahead of more corporate earnings reports, potentially ushering in volatility as investors look to how companies have weathered a tough macro climate this quarter.The upswing followed an earnings beat from Bank of America, whose net revenue rose 8% while other top banks, like Morgan Stanley, posted mixed results on Friday. Investors will also be looking for earnings reports from tech titans like Tesla and Netflix this week.Experts remain wary though of the current macro backdrop, with voices like Ed Yardeni, Scott Minerd, and Cathie Wood warning that something will soon "break" in markets as the financial system shows more signs of strain.
