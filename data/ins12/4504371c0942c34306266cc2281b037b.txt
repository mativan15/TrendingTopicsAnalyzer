It looks like Green Cross Health Limited (NZSE:GXH) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Green Cross Health investors that purchase the stock on or after the 9th of June will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of June.
