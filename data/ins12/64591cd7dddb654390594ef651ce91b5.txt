(Reuters) -U.S. stock futures fell on Wednesday as a surge in Treasury yields to multi-year highs amid rising interest rates dented gains powered by streaming giant Netflix after it reversed customer losses.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note climbed to its highest levels since late 2008 as a selloff in U.S. government bonds resumed, adding another hurdle for stock markets attempting to break out of months of declines.

Wall Street's three main indexes have notched two straight session of gains on the back of solid quarterly results from big U.
