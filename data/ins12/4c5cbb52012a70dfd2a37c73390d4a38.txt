The Supreme Court has ordered governments of Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Uttarakhand and their respective police forces to take suo motu action against hate speeches, disregarding the religion of the offenders. A two-judge bench of justices KM Joseph and Hrishikesh Roy on Friday also said that, in future, state authorities and police have to take suo motu action if someone makes a hate speech, and without waiting for a complaint to be filed. Inaction by the state or its police in cases of hate speeches would be viewed as contempt of court, the bench said.
