The Boston Celtics and forward Grant Williams are at an impasse amid rookie-scale contract extension negotiations with Monday's deadline rapidly looming, league sources told HoopsHype.

A deal in the $14-15 million annual range would likely be enough for Williams to agree to an extension, league sources told HoopsHype. However, it's unlikely the Celtics are willing to reach that figure in negotiations with the clock ticking.

Williams, who appeared in a career-high 77 games and shot 41.1 percent from three-point range last season, is primed for a big role with the Celtics this season and could bet on himself to earn more money in free agency.
