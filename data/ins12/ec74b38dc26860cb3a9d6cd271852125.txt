Michael Irvin remembers the his parting shot from his interview with ESPN suits like it was yesterday.
It was early 2003. Irvin had been starring on Fox Sports Net's 'Best Damn Sports Show Period' for several years — which is where he first worked with Stephen A. Smith — and while he was having a blast, it was a daily show. He wanted to transition to a weekend NFL studio show to open up more opportunities for movies or other business and entertainment options. 
'‘Best Damn Sports Show' was a great show at the time,' Irvin, who spoke to The Post on behalf of TradeZing — a live-streaming, Web3 and social platform geared at millennial and Gen Z traders — said.
