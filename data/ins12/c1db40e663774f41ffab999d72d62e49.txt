Hot on the heels of the Windows 11 2022 Update (22H2), Microsoft is now providing its first new group of additional features to the operating system. This includes a tabbed File Explorer, an overflow area of the Taskbar, Suggested Actions, and more — and you can download them today.

Remember, Microsoft tipped its hand in September, announcing the new Windows 11 'experiences' would be made available this month. If you're in no hurry quite yet, they'll be pushed to your PC beginning of November. The company also said that the first feature update for Windows 10, the very limited Windows 10 2022 Update, will also be released today as well.
