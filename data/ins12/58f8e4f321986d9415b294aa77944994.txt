Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak last week announced that the energy bills rebate has been doubled from £200 and that Britons will no longer need to pay it back. Eight million households on means tested benefits will receive £650, which they also won't have to pay back, as the government attempts to help cash-strapped Brits with the rising cost of living.But it has emerged that some groups, including vulnerable members of society, won't receive the £400 discount at all.Renters who pay "all-in" also won't qualify for the rebate, according to the government.
