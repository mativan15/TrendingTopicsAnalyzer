Most airlines have their own distinctive look, apparent in their plane livery, their flight attendant uniforms and their marketing, but how many offer their own smell? Guests at Singapore Airlines' refurbished lounges at Changi Airport can experience a feast for all senses, including smell, following a S$50 million (NZ$56 million), three-year upgrade that's just been completed. Passengers arriving at the SilverKris lounge at Changi's Terminal 3 will be met by a giant 12-metre, 8K Sony screen depicting a moving display of the airlines' batik motif, while the carrier's signature scent, "Batik Flora", fills the air and the relaxing sounds of instrumental tracks by composer Rohan De Livera play in the background (also heard on board during boarding and disembarkation).
