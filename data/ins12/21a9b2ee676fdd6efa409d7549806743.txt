Hold on to your hats! 'Twister' is finally getting a sequel.
A follow-up to the 1996 storm-chasing blockbuster, which will be titled 'Twisters,' is in the works, according to Deadline.
Steven Spielberg reportedly 'flipped' for the script, written by 'The Revenant' screenwriter Mark L. Smith.
The original film starred Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton, who died in 2017. The movie followed Hunt's Dr. Jo Harding and a group of fellow weather-watchers as they tested Dorothy, a tornado data-gathering device conceptualized by her ex, Bill (played by Paxton).
