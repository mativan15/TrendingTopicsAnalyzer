PITTSBURGH –After pleading guilty to charges of sex trafficking earlier this year, a man from Pittsburgh will face 15 years in prison for his crimes.

The U.S. Department of Justice announced on Thursday that they have sentenced Anthony Juskowich, 23, to 15 years in federal prison for coercing and forcing his victim into prostitution around the Pittsburgh area. Federal prosecutors report that his operation took place across Moon Township, where he was linked to over two dozen hotel reservations.

According to court documents, Juskowich's operation began when he groomed a woman from Alabama in December 2019.
