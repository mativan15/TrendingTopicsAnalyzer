A Chicago entrepreneur has big expansion plans for his South Side coffee business that include opening a downtown location and building a manufacturing facility in the Back of the Yards neighborhood.

Jesse Iniguez, 41, and his business partner, Mayra Hernandez, started Back of the Yards Coffee Co. in 2016.

Last year the company grossed $300,000 in revenues, its most to date.

'Had it not been for Covid, I'm sure our revenues would have been higher,' Iniguez said. 'But none of our 10 employees were laid off or missed a paycheck, and I am proud of that.
