Oct. 19—Route 9 in Durham was closed to traffic Tuesday evening after a culvert over Dyer Brook washed out and collapsed.

The closure, which went into effect at 7 p.m., will remain for two weeks to allow the Maine Department of Transportation time to install a new, larger culvert.

Paul Merrill, spokesman for the MDOT, said the culvert failed around 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, most likely because of the heavy rain that saturated the ground the previous night. No injuries were reported.

The closed section of Route 9 connects Durham with Lisbon Falls and is located off heavily used Route 136.
