On the morning of Saturday, Oct. 15, Mehdi Hashemi Rafsanjani drove up the mountain road to the grim prison in northern Tehran where he is serving a 10 year sentence for financial corruption. He was returning after a brief furlough.

Swarms of anti-riot security forces, holding batons and guns, had taken position in the leafy area outside Evin Prison, a feared institution that has been a watchword for the torment and execution of those who have crossed the Islamic Republic's rulers.

Mr. Hashemi Rafsanjani, the son of a former president, was stunned when prison authorities told him to return home until further notice, according to family members.
