Bringing home a six-figure salary is a mark of financial success for many people, and it's more common depending on where you live. For example, as many as 1 in 3 women in San Jose, California, brings home at least $100,000 a year, according to a new report from GoodHire, an HR platform. The analysis draws data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Department of Commerce to find out where there are higher shares of high earners across the country. It makes sense that the highest concentration of six-figure earners live in expensive cities around the Bay Area and on the East Coast.
