If you are The Great Khali, a former wrestling world champion, and you open a restaurant, it is perhaps only fitting that diners should be treated to fighting bouts between courses.Khali, 50, entered into a new career when he opened a roadside restaurant next to the wrestling academy he runs in Karnal, Haryana in India. It holds a wrestling ring and serves enormous portions of food, from the outsized chapatis, dishes cooked in a giant tandoor (clay oven) and platters of pulao to the pail-sized lassi (a yoghurt-based drink).
