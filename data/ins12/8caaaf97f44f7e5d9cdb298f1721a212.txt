Spain's Health Ministry is trying its best to isolate people showing symptoms of monkeypox. The Health Minister, Carolina Darius, claims to be ordering vaccines from the EU as part of the joint strategy to buy vaccines as a group. The strain, the minister claimed, has its roots in West Africa. However, in the meantime, medical centres and hospitals are stocking up on smallpox vaccines as the disease is very similar. Spain's tally has risen to 84, with many still under surveillance. A hundred-odd people are being kept on the watch, and it is feared that cases may increase.
