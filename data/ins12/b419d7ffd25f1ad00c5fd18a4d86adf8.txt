Homebuyers looking for less expensive cities are relocating in record numbers, a recent report said. A record 33.9% of Redfin users considered moving to another metro in July and August, according to the company's migration report. That's an increase from 32.6% in the second quarter of this year and the highest level since it began tracking migration in 2017. Most of that relocation activity was driven by homebuyers who lived in coastal areas with expensive job centers and wanted to move to a more affordable location.
