Faced with years of declining enrollments and financial strain, American colleges and universities are increasingly embracing innovations in technology, career-based curricula, and business partnerships, according to a new survey commissioned by Jenzabar, the higher education software and services company. The survey, Innovating to Create a More Flexible Path for Higher Education, is based on responses by 145 higher education administrations - most of whom were in campus leadership positions such as president, vice-president or dean - to an online survey administered in August and September, 2022.
