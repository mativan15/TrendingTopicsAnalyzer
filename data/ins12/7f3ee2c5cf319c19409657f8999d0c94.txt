Chase is the latest big bank giving customers access to direct deposits up to two business days early.

This applies to customers of Chase Secure Banking, a checking account with a $4.95 monthly service fee.

The early access includes payroll, tax refunds, government benefits and pensions. Customers can sign up for direct deposit alerts to be notified when their money is available. Those who have already signed up for these alerts will be notified via text, email or push notifications when funds have been credited to their account.
