HONG KONG—Hong Kong's chief executive announced incentives to lure talent and companies to the city, seeking to reverse an outflow driven by years of stringent pandemic controls and political upheaval that have hurt its reputation as a global business capital.

John Lee , who took the city's top office in July, unveiled plans to give two-year visas to high earners and graduates from the world's top 100 universities, tax breaks to some foreign property buyers who go on to become permanent residents and benefits to companies.
