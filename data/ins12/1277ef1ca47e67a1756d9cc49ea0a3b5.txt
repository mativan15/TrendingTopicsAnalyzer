The city of Ottawa's Transportation Committee has approved a realignment of the planned route for Stage 3 of LRT to Barrhaven to avoid displacing hundreds of residents. The original route, approved by council in November 2020, would have required demolition of 120 homes in the Manor Village and Cheryl Gardens neighbourhoods. The city would have been required to acquire the land prior to tearing the homes down and displacing the people living there. Many of the people who live in those neighbourhoods are long-time tenants and feared having to relocate to homes with much higher rental prices.
