Disturbing surveillance footage that captured a well-dressed man knocking on doors with a machete has left a Florida neighbourhood on edge.

A resident in the Broward County suburb of Lauderhill provided footage to WSVN showing the bald, clean shaven man dressed in a collared shirt, tie and dress pants approach his front door at 5.30am on Monday morning.

The unidentified man raps on the door with the handle of the machete, before walking off – one of several times he was captured approaching homes in the neighbourhood, around 10 miles (16km) west of Fort Lauderdale.
