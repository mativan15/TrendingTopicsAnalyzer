Hi guys, just posting this to keep the tradition! Hope you are doing good.

As I always do, this is my update of the stats here in Venezuela (Venezuelan living here).

Nothing excitng this week, 1 BTC less than last week. So monthly average is around 120 BTC.

These stats are only for LocalBitcoin (because they make them public), other exchanges are Binance, Airtm and Reserve. Binance is king with P2P even with Bolivares!

One BTC trades at 167,000 Bs. (Bolivares), remember that since 2007, 14 zeroes have been removed from the currency by law.
