By Anthony O. Goriainoff Revolution Bars Group PLC said Tuesday its performance in the final quarter of fiscal 2022 was softer because of reduced consumer confidence, and that it swung to a pretax profit for the year as total sales rose. The U.K. bar operator said for the year ended July 2 pretax profit was 2.1 million British pounds ($2.4 million) compared with a pretax loss of GBP26.3 million for fiscal 2021. Total sales were GBP140.8 million, up from GBP39.4 million the year before. Revenue rose to GBP140.
