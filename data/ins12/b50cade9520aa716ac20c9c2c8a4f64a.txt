The "Know Your Army" National Consumer Survey, fielded March 7-15, 2022, across a representative sample of 3,000 U.S. adults aged 18-76, found that 73 percent of Gen Z claims to be familiar with the Army – the highest of any generation – but the data breakdown tells a different story about their limited understanding of the Army and its ability to deliver on their needs.

Gen Z Misperceptions of Army Service:
