From abrogation of Article 370 to the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always accomplished the impossible, Union home minister Amit Shah said on Saturday as he exhorted people to re-elect Bharatiya Janata Party in Himachal Pradesh. Elections to the 68-seat Himachal Pradesh assembly will be held on November 12 and the votes will be counted on December 8.'Be it construction of Ram Mandir or the abrogation of Article 370, the Modi government made possible what had earlier seemed impossible,' Shah said during an election rally in Sirmaur.
