In their native Iran, they are known as Shahed, or witness. Their Russian operators know them as the innocuous sounding Geranium Two.In Ukraine, where the so-called kamikaze drones are becoming an ever-increasing threat, they are known as balalaika, after the delta-shaped Russian musical instrument they resemble, or, more simply, mopeds, for the buzzing sound they make as they loiter overhead.Waves of the Iranian-made drones struck Kyiv early this morning, their largest mass deployment against the capital, having previously menaced the city of Kharkiv, close to the front line.
