There once was a British prime minister who was renowned as the greatest campaigner of his age. He was charismatic, visionary and popular with the public.He was also amoral and immoral, a lothario who recklessly pursued women, often the wives of colleagues, as he pursued policies that were not thought through.'I can understand that the enthusiasm he has so often created is due to his dynamic temperament in a lazy sleepy world: to his jolly-good-fellowship, and high spirits,' wrote a contemporary, Helena Swanwick.
