OTTAWA - The government is still struggling to get key supports like the Canada Child Benefit into the hands of hard-to-reach groups like those living on First Nations, and isn't doing enough to make sure the money goes where it's needed, the auditor general reported Tuesday.The auditor looked at efforts to increase uptake of the child benefit, Guaranteed Income Supplement, Canada Workers Benefit and Canada Learning Bond and found the government falls short of making sure vulnerable people have access.
