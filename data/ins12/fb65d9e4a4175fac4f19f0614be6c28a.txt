Kelsey O'Hagan first heard about the Gerber Photo Search from a nurse at a doctor's appointment for her now-12-month-old son, Everett.

'She said, ‘Oh my God, you have to submit him; he's so cute, he's got such a good personality, and you could win $25,000,'' said O'Hagan, a 30-year-old stay-at-home mother from Methuen, Massachusetts. As part of the application process to be the baby food company's new 'spokesbaby,' she sent in a photo and a video of Everett, taken in April.

'I knew he wasn't going to win — not because I don't believe in him, but I just had a gut feeling that it was impossible,' she said.
