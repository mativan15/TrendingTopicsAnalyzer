The owners of the iconic Capital Iron business in Greater Victoria announced Friday that its stores will be closing Dec. 17, after being in operation since 1934. The closure affects the long-time downtown Victoria location on Store Street and the location in Langford on Langford Parkway. On Monday morning, Capital Iron owner Mike Black told Victoria radio station CFAX 1070 that the decision to close the business was difficult. He cited changes in the retail industry, the increased popularity of online shopping, supply chain issues, staff shortages and inflation as the reasons for the closure.
