Some experts are worried Alberta parents aren't getting the message that, for the first time, teenagers will be eligible for COVID-19 bivalent boosters next week.Last week, the provincial government announced that Pfizer's bivalent shot would be available to everyone 12 and up starting on Monday.Health Canada authorized this vaccine, which targets the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, earlier this month.Moderna's bivalent booster, targeting the original and Omicron BA.1 variants, was already available to Albertans 18 and up, making this the first time 12- to 17-year-olds will have access to a vaccine formulated to fight the predominant strains.
