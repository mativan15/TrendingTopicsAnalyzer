Dutch paints and coatings maker Akzo Nobel on Thursday warned of a continuing impact in its fourth quarter from high raw materials costs and too much stock as it suspended its 2023 profit guidance.The Amsterdam-based group, which makes the Dulux and Flexa paints and supplies sectors ranging from aerospace to yachts, said it expects a core profit below 150 million euros ($146.73 million) for the fourth quarter after posting 201 million in the third quarter and 209 million euros in the fourth quarter last year.
