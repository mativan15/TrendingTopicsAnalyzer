Two Ontario residents are warning others to double check their Interac e-transfers recipients before they send the transfers after they lost money making the same mistake. While Interac says the vast majority of e-transfers are sent without any issues, if you send an e-transfer to the wrong person, it can be difficult to get the money back. 'This is not a case of a fraudster, this is not a scammer, this is just me making a mistake,' Kestrel Gibson of Toronto told CTV News Toronto.. Gibson meant to transfer $3,000 from one of her accounts to another account, but she accidentally sent it to her old phone number, a number that now belongs to someone else.
