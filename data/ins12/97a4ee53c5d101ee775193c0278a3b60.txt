SAN FRANCISCO, May 26, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Zerion, the leading DeFi and NFT portfolio manager, is launching the first generative NFT linked directly to users' on-chain activity. As users explore Web3, this Dynamic NFT Avatar – or DNA for short – will evolve with them based on their actions and the assets they own. 
"With our DNA NFT, users can express their web3 identities based on the tokens they own, networks they trade on, and communities they belong to," said Evgeny Yurtaev, CEO and co-founder at Zerion.
