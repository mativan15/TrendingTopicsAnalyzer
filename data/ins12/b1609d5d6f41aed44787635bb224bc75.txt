LPETTET/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images STORE Capital (NYSE:STOR) is trading cheaply - again. As has become common for this net lease REIT ('NNN REIT'), market volatility has presented an attractive entry point for dividend investors. The stock is offering a generous 5.6% dividend yield that is backed by consistently growing cash flows. STOR has been increasing the credit quality of its portfolio, but that improvement has not led to improvements in its stock price. I can see the stock re-valuing toward a lower yield - the stock presents a compelling opportunity today.
