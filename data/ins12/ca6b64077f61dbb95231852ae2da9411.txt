MILAN (Reuters) - Outgoing Italian Finance Minister Daniele Franco gave his blessing to the appointment of Giancarlo Giorgetti as his successor, saying in a newspaper interview on Friday they shared the same ideas of what Italy needed and would certainly do well.

Giorgetti, the outgoing industry minister in Mario Draghi's government and the deputy leader of the right-wing League party, looks well placed to become economy minister in a new government led by rightist leader Giorgia Meloni.

Giorgetti is considered one of the League's most moderate and pro-European figures.
