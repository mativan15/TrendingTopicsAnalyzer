Rishi Sunak has been warned that proposals for an online sales levy amount to a 'shopping tax' that would deepen the cost-of-living crisis and 'hurt, not help, the high street'.
In a joint letter to the Chancellor, 11 prominent firms and industry groups, including Currys, Asos and Made.com say they are 'deeply concerned' that the plans for online sales tax 'would hit millions of households that are already struggling to cope with the highest inflation for 40 years and soaring bills'.
The companies' intervention follows the close of a three-month consultation on the measure, which the Treasury has said could be used to overcome an 'imbalance' between tax levied on retailers online and those in high streets, by funding business rates cuts.
