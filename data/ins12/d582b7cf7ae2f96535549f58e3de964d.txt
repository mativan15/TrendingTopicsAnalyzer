THE UNITED States Agency for
International Development (USAID) and its Philippine partners recently gathered
more than 750 representatives from government, the private sector, and civil
society to highlight the role of local governments in ensuring internet access
for marginalized and remote communities across the country. USAID's Better Access and
Connectivity (BEACON) and Cities for Enhanced Governance and Engagement
(CHANGE) projects, in collaboration with the Department of Information and
Communications Technology (DICT), the Department of the Interior and Local
Government, and the League of Cities of the Philippines, organized the
'Improving Broadband Internet Connectivity in Cities and LGUs' conference where
participants were able to share best practices in addressing internet
connectivity issues and strengthening policies on ICT governance, financing,
and investment.
