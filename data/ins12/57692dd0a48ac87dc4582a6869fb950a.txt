Oprah Winfrey, one of the country's most influential celebrities, is using her star power to help Stacey Abrams raise money in her quest to become Georgia governor.

Winfrey sent an email Wednesday announcing her support for Abrams, and inviting recipients to a webcast sit-down with her and Abrams on Thursday. She asks them to send $5 apiece to help in Abrams' rematch against Republican Governor Brian Kemp.
