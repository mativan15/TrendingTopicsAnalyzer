The Justice Department said it was recommending the most severe sentence allowed under guidelines for the two counts of contempt.

Bannon, a prominent right-wing media personality who is credited with helping Trump win the presidency in 2016, was found guilty in July for refusing to testify and hand over documents to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.

"To this day, he continues to unlawfully withhold documents and testimony that stand to help the Committee's authorized investigation to get to the bottom of what led to January 6 and ascertain what steps must be taken to ensure that it never happens again," the government said in the filing.
