BMW expects the US to be the largest market for its XM model.
 








BMW XM closely resembles the Concept XM that was unveiled in November 2021.
 

BMW thinks the existing owners of other luxury SUVs like the Lamborghini Urus, Bentley Bentayga, Land Rover Range Rover and Mercedes-Benz G-Class will be the ones who would buy the BMW XM, the successor of the legendary BMW M1. These words of optimism come from BMW M bosses, the CEO Frank Van Meel and the Vice President of Customer, Brand and Sales Timo Resch.
