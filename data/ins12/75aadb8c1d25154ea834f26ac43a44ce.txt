SILIGURI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday claimed that it was not her but the CPM which drove away Tata Motors from Singur .Addressing a 'Bijaya Samillani' or post-Durga Puja meeting in Siliguri, Banerjee said she only returned the land to the people that was forcibly acquired by the former Left Front government for the Tata Motors' Nano factory in Singur in Hooghly district."There are people who are spreading canards that have driven away the Tatas from West Bengal. I did not force them away, but it was the CPM which drove them away," she said at the government function, adding that she thought of not making any political statement at the programme.
