It certainly might concern Karora Resources Inc. (TSE:KRR) shareholders to see the share price down 30% in just 30 days. But that doesn't undermine the fantastic longer term performance (measured over five years). To be precise, the stock price is 416% higher than it was five years ago, a wonderful performance by any measure. So we don't think the recent decline in the share price means its story is a sad one. But the real question is whether the business fundamentals can improve over the long term.
