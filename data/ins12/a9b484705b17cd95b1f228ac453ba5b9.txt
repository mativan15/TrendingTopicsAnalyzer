Code has become Shanea Leven 's mission. Specifically, making code repositories easier to understand and helping developers ship updates faster with fewer mistakes. Leven got her first computer when she was 12 and started programming Excel macros, but she didn't always dream of working in tech. She tried law and also considered investment banking but instead studied computer science at the University of Maryland. As a kid, Leven also wanted to be president of the United States.

'My mom and my grandmother are both my heroes,' Leven said.
