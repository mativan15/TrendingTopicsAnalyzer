Coach Jonathan Trott Captain Mohammad Nabi T20WC best Super 10s (2016)Afghanistan have won 10 of their 20 games in the last year, notably losing a five-match series 3-2 in Ireland in August – albeit while experimenting with their batting order. In last year's World Cup they comfortably beat the two qualifiers in the Super 12 group, Namibia and Scotland, but lost their three other games and their reliance on spin means that surfaces in Australia are likely to suit them less. Unpromisingly, the only other automatic qualifier for this year's Super 12s that they have ever beaten in this format is Bangladesh.
