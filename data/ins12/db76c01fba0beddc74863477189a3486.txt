India's capital market regulator approved the government's proposal to convert dues of over $1.92 billion by telecom operator Vodafone Idea to equity, news agency Reuters quotes two senior government officials as saying on Thursday. The central government last year had approved a rescue package for debt-strapped telecom companies that allowed them to convert interest on deferred adjusted gross revenue owed to the government into equity. Analysts saw this package as a bailout for Vodafone Idea, which was on the verge of bankruptcy.
