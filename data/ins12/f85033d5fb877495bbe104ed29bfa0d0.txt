Interesting finding this week is which are the best investment over a long term period of 20 years. And Reits came on top based on below chart.Since this is US focus, SG Reit likely performs better after Forex based on historical exchange rate below.The other context to consider is that Homes may not be that bad for Singapore due to lower tax rate and Asian Market in general favors properties.Even Gold and Oil have better returns. So why do we still need to invest in S&P 500 for long term ? You tell me ? Maybe we need 100 years track record however past performance is still never implied future returns will be.
