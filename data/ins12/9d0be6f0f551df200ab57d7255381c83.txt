The Prime Minister has been under mounting pressure from Conservative MPs following the publication of Sue Gray's report into partygate last month. Mr Johnson saw off a potential challenge from his detractors back in January after rebels failed to submit enough letters to 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady.However, the Prime Minister, along with wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, has since received a fixed penalty notice during the Metropolitan Police's 'Operation Hillman' investigation.
