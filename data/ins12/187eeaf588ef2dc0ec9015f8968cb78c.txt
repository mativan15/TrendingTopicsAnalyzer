CloudVisual Long-term investors in Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG) have suffered over the past decade. The stock of the leading offshore drilling operator posted a 10Y total return CAGR of -22.7%, as it demonstrated its value-destruction capability for investors.

Hence, it offered astute investors who capitalized on the market's extreme pessimism to ride the recovery through its March 2022 highs.
