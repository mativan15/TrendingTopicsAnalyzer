JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Shaquill Griffin won't enjoy rewatching Jacksonville's fifth consecutive loss at Indianapolis. The veteran cornerback was picked on repeatedly by the Colts and beaten by a rookie receiver for the winning touchdown in a 34-27 loss Sunday. It was Griffin's worst performance in two years with the Jaguars and should be a clear sign that general manager Trent Baalke needs to start looking to upgrade the all-important coverage position. Griffin is the team's highest-paid player, making $11.
