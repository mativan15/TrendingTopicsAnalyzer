SOUTHERN PINES — Life-size photos and posters of Karrie Webb dotted the landscape at the Pine Needles Lodge and Golf Club this week along with those of other former champions of the U.S. Women's Open Championship.

Next July, when the event moves to Pebble Beach, Minjee Lee's likeness will be included with those champion displays.

The 26-year-old earned her championship portrait Sunday with a dominant performance in the final round of the 77th edition of the Women's Open at Pine Needles.

Lee used a 4-hole birdie run in Round 3 to take a 3-stroke lead into Sunday, and increased that advantage to as much as 5 strokes over runner-up Mina Harigae before settling for a 4-stroke triumph.
