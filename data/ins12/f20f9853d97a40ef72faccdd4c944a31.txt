Snap's bad year continues. Snap on Thursday reported revenue of US$1.13 billion for the three months ending in September, a slight 6 per cent increase from the year prior and less than Wall Street had expected, as the company confronts tightening advertiser budgets in an uncertain economy. In a letter to investors, Snapchat's parent company said its revenue growth was slowed by several factors, including growing competition and jitters from the advertisers who make up its core business. "We are finding that our advertising partners across many industries are decreasing their marketing budgets, especially in the face of operating environment headwinds, inflation-driven cost pressures, and rising costs," the company said in the letter.
