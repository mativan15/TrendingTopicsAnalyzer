REUTERS/Matthew ChildsOct 21 (Reuters) - Holiday Inn owner IHG (IHG.L) said on Friday its third-quarter hotel room revenue jumped from year-ago numbers and has also exceeded pre-pandemic levels, buoyed by higher room prices and solid summer demand for travel.Hotel operators are benefiting as people spend more on travel and book longer hotel stays, lifting occupancy rates and prices, although they are facing risks from stubborn inflation and a cost-of-living crisis that cast a cloud over winter demand.
