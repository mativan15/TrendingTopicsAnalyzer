Amazon is offering a new and more orderly way for shoppers to buy a PS5. You can request an invitation right here on the console's product page (it's to the right, where a 'buy' button would normally be located), and the company says that if you're chosen, you'll receive an e-mail with a link to purchase one within 72 hours. What's more, you don't need to be a Prime subscriber to request an invite.
So far, this invite-based system seems to be in place only for the more costly $499.
