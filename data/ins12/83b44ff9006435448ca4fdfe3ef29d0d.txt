Sixteen Just Stop Oil protestors have been arrested after blocking the road outside Holborn Underground station in a stand against government policies. In the latest demonstration in a week of action, supporters blocked the junction of High Holborn and Kingsway, by sitting down and demanding an end to new oil and gas. The 22 activists sat down at 10.50am on Friday , with five of the group glueing themselves onto tarmac. Others chanted and held banners. The Metropolitan Police responded within minutes to unglue the protestors stuck to the floor and said the 16 were arrested on suspicion of willful obstruction.
