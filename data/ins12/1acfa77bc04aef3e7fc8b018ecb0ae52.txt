Stock-market investors have been adjusting to the jump in interest rates amid high inflation, but they have yet to cope with profit headwinds faced by the S&P 500, according to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.'While a rate peak may solidify estimates for the equity risk premium and valuation multiples, equity investors still face the bear market's second act — the earnings outlook,' said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in a note Monday.  'They have been slow to recognize that pricing power and operating margins, which hit all-time highs in the past two years, are unsustainable,' she said.
