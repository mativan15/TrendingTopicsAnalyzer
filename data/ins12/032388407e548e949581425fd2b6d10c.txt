Embattled prime minister Liz Truss declared during another torrid session of Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday that she is 'a fighter, not a quitter' as calls for her resignation continue, provoking ironic jeers from the Commons benches.'I have been very clear that I am sorry, and I have made mistakes,' she told Parliament. 'I am somebody who's prepared to front up. I'm prepared to take the tough decisions.'Having to make this fateful pronouncement tends to bode very ill indeed for any politician, as it is a fairly frank admission that their situation has become perilous and necessitated a shift towards the defensive.
