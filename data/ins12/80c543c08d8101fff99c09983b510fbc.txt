Liz Truss has resigned as UK prime minister after a mere 45 days in office, making her the shortest-serving leader in British history.

The Conservative politician had been elected on 6 September in a leadership race following the resignation of her predecessor, Boris Johnson.

Truss's short-lived government was marked by cabinet reshuffles and highly unpopular economic proposals, which upset markets and caused the British pound to plummet.

Following her resignation, here are some reactions from leaders across Europe.
