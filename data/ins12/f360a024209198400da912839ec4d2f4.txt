LONDON (AP) — China's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday its diplomatic missions abroad have the right to 'take necessary measures' to maintain security after British police opened an investigation into the assault of a Hong Kong protester who alleged he was dragged into the Chinese Consulate in Manchester and beaten up during a demonstration.

Police in the English city of Manchester said a peaceful protest outside the Chinese Consulate on Sunday turned into a 'hostile' situation when unidentified men came out of the building, dragged one of the protesters into the consulate grounds and assaulted him.
