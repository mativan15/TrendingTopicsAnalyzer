David McNew/Getty Images News Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) approaches an eight-year high, +1.6% to nearly $100 in Friday's trading after crude oil prices extend their gains and J.P. Morgan reiterated an Overweight rating and $108 price target on the stock, saying the company's "re-rating story still has legs." Exxon (XOM) shares have more upside following the "de-rating" that took place in the 2020 downturn, as investors are not fully accounting for its diversified portfolio, a much-improved balance sheet, a recently tripled commitment to stock buybacks, and its restraint on capital spending, JPM's Phil Gresh said, according to Karishma Vanjani at Barron's.
