Jun. 2—SALISBURY — Salisbury police confirmed Wednesday the department is investigating the recent death of a 4-year-old border collie who died last week after spending four days at local dog kennel business Nose to Nub Dog Massage.

"This is like a nightmare," Brittany Martin of Amesbury said Wednesday regarding the death of Mikah.

Martin described Mikah as a lovable, mellow and well-tempered dog who loved to play catch with a tennis ball. She and her husband, Jake, had just purchased a home with an acre of land specifically for Mikah to have plenty of space to roam and play.
