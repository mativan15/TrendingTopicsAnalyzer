American Idol alum David Archuleta, who came in second to David Cook on the seventh season of the show, is very grateful for where he is more than a year after coming out.

"I feel like it's a miracle that I've gotten to this place where I am accepting myself," he told Out in an interview published this week. "I didn't think I ever could. I thought the only way that I could accept myself was if this part of me was gone and to get rid of it and praying that this part would no longer be associated with who I am.
