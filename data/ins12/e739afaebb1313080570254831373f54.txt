On Feb. 24, as Russian troops poured into Ukraine on Day 1 of the invasion, an employee for a yacht management company sent an email to the captain of the Amadea, a $325 million superyacht: 'Importance: High.'

The family of a Russian oligarch under sanctions had spent much of January and February cruising from island to island in the Caribbean and had some questions and concerns. When would be a good time to visit New Zealand? Bali? Could the yacht get a special boat to pull water skiers? And would the staff of the Amadea please stop folding napkins in triangles? 'Guests don't like it,' wrote the employee, Victoria Pastukhova, a 'client coordinator' for the company, Imperial Yachts.
