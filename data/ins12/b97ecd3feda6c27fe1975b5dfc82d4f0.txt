Oct. 20—JEFFERSONVILLE — A self-described centrist who fears the middle is being eliminated from politics, former Democratic state representative Steve Stemler still believes a person with a desire to help can make a tangible difference.

The president and owner of Stemler Corp. and a member of multiple boards, Stemler wasn't exactly searching for ways to keep himself occupied when the phone rang about a month ago. He was somewhat surprised to be speaking with an official in Gov. Eric Holcomb's administration.
