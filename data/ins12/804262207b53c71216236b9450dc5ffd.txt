Hitting out at Opposition parties, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said some political parties believe that their ideology is incomplete if they didn't 'abuse' Gujarat and asked people of Gujarat to be warned against those trying to spread despair in the state.
Addressing a public meeting in Junagadh after launching projects worth Rs 4,155 crore in Junagadh, Gir Somnath and Porbandar districts, Modi said even though Gujarat is providing employment to people from across the country, some political parties continue to 'abuse' and 'defame' the state.
