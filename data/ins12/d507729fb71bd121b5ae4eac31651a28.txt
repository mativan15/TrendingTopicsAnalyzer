Occidental Petroleum Corporation OXY, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, has been a substantial beneficiary from the energy surge over the past year. The company sports a ‘B' rating for our Zacks Growth Style Score, indicating a strong likelihood that the stock continues to propel higher on the heels of strong earnings and sales growth.

Occidental Petroleum is vastly outperforming the market this year and looks to build on the recent momentum. After becoming extremely undervalued back when the coronavirus outbreak initially struck, the stock has surged more than 700% since the pandemic-induced market plunge back in March of 2020 and continues to make a series of new 52-week highs.
