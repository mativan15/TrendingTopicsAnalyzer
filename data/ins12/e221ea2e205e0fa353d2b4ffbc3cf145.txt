The Spain international, who made his 500th club appearance on Sunday against Newcastle United, is in the final 12 months of his contract at Old Trafford.
As is the case with most of their players, United have the option to extend de Gea's deal by another 12 months. De Gea remains the firm first choice goalkeeper at the club with Dean Henderson shipped out on loan to Nottingham Forest in the summer.
