Chandigarh : Two days after Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit sought the removal of Satbir Singh Gosal as the vice-chancellor (V-C) of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), terming his appointment 'totally illegal', chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Thursday wrote back to him, saying the norms and procedures were followed in his selection. In a communication to the governor, the CM wrote that Gosal's appointment was done as per the laid norms of the Haryana and Punjab Agricultural University Act, 1970, by the university's board.
