Hi, most of you don't have to deal with this, but some of you might find this useful.

This method requires root.

Keep in mind this is for stock Android 11 and up. Most Android skins (OneUI, MIUI, etc.) can bypass it with no problem.

Anyways, let's get into the tutorial.

Turn off your wifi. Download and install Termux from here (taken from this webiste). After installed, open Termux. Type su and allow root access. Type vi /data/misc/apexdata/com.android.wifi/WifiConfigStore.xml . Hold the arrow down button, untill you see your wifi SSID (name).
