The Strictly Come Dancing mole has defended leaking the result of the dance-off online every week, insisting he is "providing a service" to fans of the show.

Though the elimination show of the BBC dance contest airs on a Sunday evening, it is filmed 'as live' straight after the Saturday episode.

And since 2012 superfan Dave Thorp has been leaking the result of the dance-off on a Saturday evening on his website Strictly Spoiler, with links on social media.
