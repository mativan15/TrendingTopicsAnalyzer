The Wrap Trevor Noah had a pretty good reaction to a campaign ad ran by right wing Louisiana U.S. Senator John Kennedy, and honestly it's a show we'd probably watch: CSI: Crack Smoking Investigators.An ad Kennedy is currently running in his home state leans hard on his love and support for cops and his opposition to something no one has done — defund the police. And at the end of the clip, Kennedy says 'if you hate cops just because they're cops, the next time you get in trouble, call a crackhead.
