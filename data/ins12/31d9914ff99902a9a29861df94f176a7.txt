A former governor and former Argus Leader editor are part of the class of 10 inductees into the South Dakota Hall of Fame.

Former Gov. Dennis Daugaard and Randell Beck have been honored for their professional and political contributions to the state, according to an announcement from the Hall of Fame.

Former governor Dennis Daugaard laughs at a joke T. Denny Sanford made about Sanford's $55 million donation to Children's Home Society Tuesday, Jan. 8, in Sioux Falls. Sanford said Daugaard picked his pocket.
