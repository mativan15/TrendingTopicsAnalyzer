Auckland-based bra company Rose & Thorne says women are sold on its online bra fittings, which it launched after the first Covid lockdown when in-person fittings weren't possible. Managing director Sue Dunmore​ said many women were not aware their bra was the wrong size for their body shape. 'In about 90% of cases, I will take them down a bra size and put them up several cup sizes – because inherently a woman knows the bra doesn't fit, but she thinks she has put on weight,' she said. When the business began 11 years ago, its best-selling size was 14B.
