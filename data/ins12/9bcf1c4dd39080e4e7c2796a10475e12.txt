Former Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone has denied being arrested in Brazil for allegedly trying to take a gun on board a private flight bound for Switzerland on Wednesday.Though the Sao Paulo state public security office said to Reuters that an unnamed businessman had been arrested at Viracopos International Airport in Campinas 50 miles from Sao Paulo, the 91-year-old stated "I was never arrested" to the same outlet and described his brush with the law as a "silly, tiny little incident"."I haven't had any publicity lately and I thought I ought to do something to get some," Ecclestone joked, while confirming that he had indeed paid a fine of 6,060 Brazilian reais ($1,260) in bail as originally reported before being allowed to continue his trip.
