The new owners of Slim's Country Market, Jessica and Kent Allen, pose in front of their business along with their son, Arrow.

Slim's Country Market has been an iconic business along U.S. Highway 69 near Story City for decades. The fruit and vegetable store got its start in 1943 and draws people from across the state for its fresh produce, flowers and Iowa-made products.

This season, Slim's opened under new ownership as Kent and Jessica Allen of Ames took over the shop.

Kent Allen has a long history of working with produce at Hy-Vee for 25 years — 20 years as the department manager.
