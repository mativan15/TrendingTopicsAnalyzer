Progressive Democrats are ripping the Federal Reserve over deepening concerns the central bank could drive the U.S. into recession amid sky-high inflation not seen in four decades.

Top liberal lawmakers are urging the Fed to stop hiking interest rates and slowing the U.S. economy, insisting that it'll do nothing to curb inflation while plunging millions into joblessness.

'I think they're hurting the situation,' Sen. Bernie Sanders, chair of the Senate Budget Committee, said Sunday on NBC's 'Meet the Press,' referring to the Fed's rate hike campaign.
