It's been a constant problem for the 49ers under Kyle Shanahan, and it's one that's rearing its ugly head again in 2022.
The 49ers continue to have a turnover problem.
San Francisco committed three more on Sunday in its 28-14 loss in Atlanta, sending them back to .500 after two promising wins.
The first turnover of the day proved particularly costly, as Jeff Wilson's fumble was returned for a touchdown by the Falcons. It put the 49ers in an early 14-point hole, and forced them to start working through the air.
