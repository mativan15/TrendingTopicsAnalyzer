NEW YORK -- The Yankees have no plans to dislodge Josh Donaldson from third base during this American League Championship Series, manager Aaron Boone said on Friday.
Donaldson's performance has been a focal point early in the ALCS, as the veteran has struck out in five of six at-bats against Houston pitching. He certainly hasn't been alone in struggling to make contact; the Yankees have fanned 30 times across the first two games, both Houston victories.
'As we struggle for offense, period, it's interesting that everyone jumps on him,' Boone said.
