A senior Chinese diplomat in the UK has admitted to pulling a protester's hair in a scuffle that is threatening to worsen relations between the countries.

In two interviews, Zheng Xiyuan, the Chinese consul-general in Manchester, acknowledged his involvement in the Sunday clash and sought to justify his actions by blaming demonstrators for erecting placards that ridiculed Chinese President Xi Jinping.

'I don't attack anybody. I am there peacefully,' the diplomat said in an interview with Sky News on Wednesday.
