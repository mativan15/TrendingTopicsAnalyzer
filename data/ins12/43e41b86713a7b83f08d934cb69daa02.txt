With the objective of giving a boost to the domestic manufacturing segment and create jobs, the government is considering proposals to extend Rs 35,000 crore PLI scheme to different sectors. These sectors include leather, bicycle, some vaccine materials, and certain telecom products, reported PTI citing an official. PLI (production linked incentive) benefits are also being considered for toys, some chemicals and shipping containers. "The proposals are at discussion stage. Inter-ministerial talks are going on to extend PLI benefits to all these different sectors as there has been demand from industry and certain departments," PTI quoted the official as saying.
