Warning: spoilers ahead for House of the Dragon episode 9.
House of the Dragon episode 9 marks a huge shift in the story of the Game of Thrones prequel, as the death of King Viserys I Targaryen (Paddy Considine) sparks a new level of deceit in King's Landing.
After the king's death, Queen Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) sets the plan in motion to ensure her son Prince Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) is crowned king, despite the late monarch's eldest child Princess Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy) having been publicly named his heir years before.
