Arizona will serve as a national test case when voters are asked to approve a ballot measure that backers say is intended to protect consumers from bankruptcy and poverty because of medical debt.

A "yes" vote on Arizona Proposition 209 — the Predatory Debt Collection Act — on Nov. 8 would reduce maximum interest rates on medical debt for state residents and increase the value of assets protected from debt collectors.

If successful, it also could serve as a template for ballot measures in other states.
