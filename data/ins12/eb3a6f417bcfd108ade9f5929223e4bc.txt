Saturday marked the end of an era for the Saleh family and Edmonton's Strathearn community as Ralph's Handi Mart closed its doors. For more than 35 years, the family business sold everything you expected a convenience store to have and more, including chicken that was famous city-wide. But it was the community connections that set the store apart. Hussein Saleh opened the store, and over the years, his wife, children, and extended family all would take turns helping out by working at the community's beloved convenience store.
