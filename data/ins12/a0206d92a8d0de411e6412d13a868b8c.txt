Boris Johnson is expected to run for the Tory leadership, as per media reports. The former prime minister resigned only six weeks ago and is listening to thoughts on the issue, according to reports. He believes it is in the national interest that he should contest re-election. However, some MPs have expressed doubts about Johnson's leadership campaign's viability. Sir Robert Syms, a Conservative member of parliament, described his leadership bid as a "dream."

He stated that the nomination quota would be raised to reduce the number of candidates, and there would be intense pressure on the second candidate on the MPs' ballot to withdraw.
