If it snows in Southland this winter, the Government will still classify the region as being in a drought. That's because while it has rained in the province after months of hot weather, the Government expects the impacts of the dry summer will continue to be felt for many months. Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor declared a medium-scale adverse event classification for Southland and parts of Otago on March 31, after rainfall on the south coast was the lowest since records began 50 years ago and some rivers dried up to levels only seen about every 80 years.
