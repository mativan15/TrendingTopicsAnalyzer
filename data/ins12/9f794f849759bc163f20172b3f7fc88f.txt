The DIY chain Wickes has said its energy costs could rise by £7.5m next year and warned of growing uncertainty regarding consumer confidence.The home improvement retailer said that total sales grew by 2.6% in the third quarter, strengthening in September after wilting during the heatwaves in July and August.The company said the 'stabilisation' in sales – which were flat at its core DIY business but grew 12.2% across its 'do it for me' home installation service – meant that it expects to hit its full-year adjusted profits target of £72m-£82m.
