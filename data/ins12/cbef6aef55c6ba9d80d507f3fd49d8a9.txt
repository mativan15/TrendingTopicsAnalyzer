The Jacksonville Jaguars played well enough offensively to beat the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday, but the defense couldn't do nearly enough to slow Matt Ryan in a 34-27 loss. A week earlier, the roles were reversed as the Jaguars offense failed to do enough to capitalize on the defense's strong showing against the Houston Texans in a 13-6 loss.
Getting both sides of the ball to play well enough to win at the same time has been a challenge. And it's the biggest issue the Jaguars need to fix, according to coach Doug Pederson.
