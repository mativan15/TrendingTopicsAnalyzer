The Washington Commanders don't expect to have starting quarterback Carson Wentz for at least a month due to a broken ring finger he suffered during Thursday night's win over the Chicago Bears.

NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported that Wentz went to see a hand specialist in Los Angeles and is facing a recovery time anywhere from four to six weeks.

Through the first six weeks of the season, Wentz has thrown 10 touchdowns and six interceptions, and ranks 13th among NFL quarterbacks, averaging 248.
