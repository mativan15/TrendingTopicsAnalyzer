Was the writing on the wall for the quick spread of protests after the killing of Masha Amini? According to the Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA), political science researchers had already warned that such a situation was likely to break out earlier this year.

In a paper titled "Analysis of Social Guild Protests in Iran from the Perspective of Street Politics Theory," Khalilollah Sardarnia, a political science professor at Shiraz University, and Hengameh Alborzi, a PHD student at the university, argued that protests which swept Iran in 2017 were a "turning point" with economic and social change becoming the main drivers of protests and the behavior of protesters drastically changing.
