Almost 90 percent of Fiordland businesses say they don't have enough staff to operate at full steam and some are calling on the Government to rethink immigration settings. The business owners say government needs to make it easier for migrants to take up jobs in New Zealand if they have any hope of competing with other countries for labour to rebuild following the Covid-19 pandemic. They want the cost of visas to be lowered, for the process to be streamlined, and for visa holders to be allowed to stay in New Zealand longer.
