Ahead of the civic polls in June, the ruling BJP, Aam Aadmi Party and Congress are turning up the heat with rallies in Haryana. The polling in 28 municipal committees and 18 municipal councils of the state will be held on June 19. Addressing his party's first state-level rally here, Kejriwal sought people's support for his party in the municipal body polls next month. 
"We ended corruption in Delhi and Punjab and will end it in Haryana as well," said Kejriwal, seeking people's support for the 2024 state assembly polls.
