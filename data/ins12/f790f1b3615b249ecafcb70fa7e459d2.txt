Weeks after completing its eighth acquisition in about a year, a Raleigh-based service provider to medical technology companies has new leadership.

Veranex announced Thursday that Tom Daulton is the company's new CEO. David Dockhorn, who previously led the firm, is taking a newly created role as chief operating officer.

The company was established by former employees of PRA Health Sciences – which was acquired last year by Icon plc (Nasdaq: ICLR).

Prior to joining Veranex, Daulton was the chairman and CEO for National Dentex Labs, a full-service dental lab network, for seven years.
