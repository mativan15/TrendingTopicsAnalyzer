Former NFL quarterback Jay Cutler was celebrating after he laid eyes on the divorce settlement with his soon-to-be ex-wife, former reality star Kristin Cavallari. 
'When the settlement came through, I threw a party,' a laughing Cutler said during a conversation with Clay Travis on the latest episode of his 'Uncut with Jay Cutler' podcast.
Cutler, who spent most of his 12 NFL seasons with the Bears, said he and Cavallari, 35, 'made out OK' in the divorce after splitting in April 2020. Their divorce is not yet finalized, however.
