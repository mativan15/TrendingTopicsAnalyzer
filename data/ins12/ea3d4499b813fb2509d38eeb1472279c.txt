Propeller, a new climate-tech investor with a focus on the ocean, tells TechCrunch that it has hooked $100 million for its first seed fund.
Co-founded by former HubSpot CEO Brian Halligan, the venture firm said in a statement that it backs and incubates startups in areas like ocean carbon removal, algae packaging, offshore wind, desalination and shipping decarbonization. Halligan called such companies 'tomorrow's ‘narwhals'' in a statement. (Referring to $1 billion-plus ocean-tech startups.)
Narwhals look sort of like underwater unicorns, and they appear to be extremely vulnerable to climate change.
