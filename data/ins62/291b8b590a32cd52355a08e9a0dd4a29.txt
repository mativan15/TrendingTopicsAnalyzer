 TORONTO – The Toronto Maple Leafs recalled forwards Nick Robertson and Wayne Simmonds along with defenceman Victor Mete from the AHL's Toronto Marlies on Sunday.
Toronto was provided some cap space to make the moves after goaltender Matt Murray was placed on long-term injured reserve on Saturday.Murray, who was scheduled to start in Saturday's 3-2 win over the Ottawa Senators, is set to miss at least four weeks with an abductor injury. Erik Kallgren was recalled before the game to serve as a backup to Ilya Samsonov.
