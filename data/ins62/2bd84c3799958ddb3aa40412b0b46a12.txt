Barely days after the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government completed half of its five-year term, murmurs within the alliance over a change in the leadership have already reached the public domain. Nationalist Congress Party's (NCP) Lok Sabha MP Supriya Sule visited Tuljabhavani temple in Osmanabad on Monday to pray for good rain and to seek the blessings of the goddess to alleviate farmers' suffering. The priest, however, prayed for an NCP chief minister in the state after the assembly elections in 2024.
