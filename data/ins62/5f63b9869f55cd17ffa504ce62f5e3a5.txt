MILLIONS of UK homes are full of unwanted tech that could be turned into much-needed cash for Christmas.
If you hoard gadgets, now's the time to sell off those old mobiles and laptops.
An unused iPhone 13 Pro could earn you £622
The new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 could bag you £500 if you have one to sell
iPad Pro 5's will sell for around £907
There are on average 20 unused devices in every home, according to the Recycle Your Electricals Campaign. Together they're worth £5.6billion, which means every household could make around £200 by clearing out and cashing in.
