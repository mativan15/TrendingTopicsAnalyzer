The riches available from Uefa competitions to a relatively small elite stands to create a two-tier system, or further deepen those that already exist. A Uefa group stage Champions League payment of around €140 million would be roughly equivalent to a Premier League seventh place finish. The prospective jump in Europa League group stage payments would transform that competition from Thursday night irritation to something that would offer a club a serious domestic advantage. That is before the extra matchday ticketing income from those games is factored in.
