It's normal to be annoyed when stock you own has a declining share price. But often it is not a reflection of the fundamental business performance. The Pactiv Evergreen Inc. (NASDAQ:PTVE) is down 27% over a year, but the total shareholder return is -24% once you include the dividend. That's better than the market which declined 25% over the last year. Pactiv Evergreen may have better days ahead, of course; we've only looked at a one year period.

While the stock has risen 4.0% in the past week but long term shareholders are still in the red, let's see what the fundamentals can tell us.
