The Supreme Court declined Monday to hear a case that would have expanded the country's birthright citizenship policy to American Samoa.

The justices did not give reasons for refusing to hear the case, which touched on thorny issues of American territorial expansion around the turn of the 20th century.

A series of high court rulings known as the Insular Cases had concluded that some of the country's new additions were likely to become states and should be treated one way, while others were likely to remain as possessions.
