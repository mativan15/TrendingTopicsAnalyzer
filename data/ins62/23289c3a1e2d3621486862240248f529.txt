Oct. 14—The 47th state House District shrank from nine to eight towns with 2020 Census redistricting, but the sprawling district still more resembles a Senate district, stretching from Chaplin to the northern portion of Norwich.

Media coverage is sparse in the upper region, leaving four-term incumbent Republican Doug Dubitsky of Chaplin and Democratic opponent Dave Nowakowski of Lisbon, also endorsed by the Working Families Party, with the challenge of trying to get their message out to voters. The district includes Chaplin, Scotland, Canterbury, Sprague and portions of Lisbon, Plainfield, Brooklyn and Norwich.
