Since the first of the year, the S&P 500 is down more than 16%. Depending on how your retirement funds are invested, you might be seeing a drop of 10% or more in your balance. The big question is: Can you still retire a millionaire after this stock market sell-off?
The answer depends on multiple factors -- including how old you are, how you're invested, how you spend your income, when the market recovers, and so on. And while you can't predict the future precisely, you can evaluate whether you're still on track to save seven figures for retirement.
