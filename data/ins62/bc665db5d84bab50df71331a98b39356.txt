Now that British pest control giant Rentokil Initial has officially acquired Terminix in a $6.7 billion deal, the combined company's North American region is called Rentokil Terminix.

But as MBJ reported last week, not every Terminix executive is sticking around post-merger. Bob Riesbeck, EVP and CFO; David Dart, SVP and chief HR officer; Deidre Richardson, SVP and general counsel, and Dion Persson, SVP of strategy and mergers and acquisitions; will all leave the company on Oct. 27.

With them departing, however, other employees — from both the Rentokil and Terminix sides of the house — are set to step into larger leadership roles.
