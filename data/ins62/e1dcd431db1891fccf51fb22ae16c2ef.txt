The shares of C3.ai Inc (NYSE:AI) are down 8.9% at $16.90 at last check, despite the tech name's smaller-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter losses, which came alongside a revenue beat. What's hurting the equity instead is a dismal current-quarter and annual revenue forecast, which came well below analysts' estimates due to slower customer growth and weaker demand.

In turn, Piper Sandler downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "overweight," and slashed its price objective to $15 from $28. Another five analysts followed suit with price target cuts as well.
