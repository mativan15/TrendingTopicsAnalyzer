Tiger King star Doc Antle has been arrested by the FBI in South Carolina yesterday.
Antle, real name Mahamayavi Bhagavan Antle, was a key player in the Netflix series Tiger King and welcomed the cameras into his private zoo, Myrtle Beach Safari. 
According to TMZ, the 62-year-old was booked in Horry County, South Carolina, around 3.30pm local time on Friday.
The outlet claims: ‘Federal law enforcement sources close to the investigation tell us the charges have to do with money laundering,' adding that Antle is due to appear in court next week.
