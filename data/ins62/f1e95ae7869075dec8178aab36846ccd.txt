Last week, the number of employees who listed Apple as their employer on LinkedIn was slashed in half over a 24-hour period. Despite what it may look like, this wasn't the result of massive internal turmoil at Apple, but rather, a crackdown by LinkedIn on fake and bot accounts. Jay Pinho, a developer who tracks data on the professional networking site, was the first to spot plummeting employee numbers at Apple and Amazon. He shared his findings with Krebs on Security, a cybersecurity blog.On October 10, 576,562 LinkedIn accounts listed Apple as their current employer.
