Maya Jama appears to have shut down Ekin-Su Culculoglu's claim that she was ‘offered' the chance to host Love Island. 
It was announced last week that Maya, 28, will be replacing Laura Whitmore as host of the popular ITV2 dating show after speculation she was bosses' favourite pick. 
However, Ekin-Su, 28, later revealed that she had been approached by producers to take on the coveted role, but turned it down as she didn't feel ready having only just left the Love Island villa herself after winning the latest series with boyfriend Davide Sanclimenti.
