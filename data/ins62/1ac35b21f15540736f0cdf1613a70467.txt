Not winning a medal at the Commonwealth Games was by far the lowest point of my career.For weeks after Birmingham I was angry, I was essentially grieving. There was this sense of loss for the Games, loss for a medal that never happened, a loss for the time spent building to that moment.There's a post-Games blues feeling that you always get. But this was deeper. It was anger driven. I was making life awful for my coach. I was going into the gym and throwing weights around.I was angry at absolutely everything and everyone and it's those moments that are the most difficult.
