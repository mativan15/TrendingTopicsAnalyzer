traveler1116/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images CFRA analyst Alexander Yokum downgraded Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) stock to Hold from Buy on Thursday after the regional bank's Q3 results showed slower loan growth as the more tepid economy cools. "Loan growth was cut in half in the third quarter and settled in at just 2% as the strong growth from the previous two quarters dissipated," the analyst wrote in a note to clients. Fifth Third (FITB) stock has dropped 2.5% in Thursday morning trading.
