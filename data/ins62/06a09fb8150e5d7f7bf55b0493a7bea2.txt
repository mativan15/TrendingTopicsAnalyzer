On Thursday, UK prime minister Liz Truss bowed to mounting pressure and resigned as prime minister of the United Kingdom. Truss lasted just 44 days in the top job. Her first major act was the launch of her mini-budget in late September which promised billions of pounds of unfunded tax cuts as well as a cap on energy prices. Her plans sank sterling, pushing the British currency to record lows against the US dollar at one point. They also caused yields on UK gilts to soar and drove share prices across the London Stock Exchange lower.
