'XD,' or sometimes 'X,' are stock-symbol extensions that denote when a stock is ex-dividend. Ex-dividend means the seller of the stock already has received the current dividend, so none will be paid to the stock's buyer. The stock price typically falls, all else being equal, by the value of the dividend on the ex-dividend date.
 
XD is one of many ticker-symbol extensions. The extensions originated when shares traded on actual tape that streamed through brokerage offices and were listed in newspapers.
