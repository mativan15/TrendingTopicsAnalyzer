The streaming service once had a massive advantage over its rivals, but that is gone and the company keeps making the wrong moves.

The company was built on content. At first, that meant mailing you DVDs, which was more convenient than going to Blockbuster or your local video rental store. In addition, the company did not charge late frees, so if you kept "Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol" for a month, you did not face the shame and added cost of returning it to an actual person.
