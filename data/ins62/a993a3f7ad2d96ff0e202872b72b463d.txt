Little could separate Koepka from close friend and American compatriot Peter Uihlein all weekend and they matched each other birdie for birdie on the first two playoff holes. But Koepka eventually prevailed after Uihlein´s third shot from the sand went into the water while Koepka hit a textbook shot before making the putt to seal his first victory since February 2021.
