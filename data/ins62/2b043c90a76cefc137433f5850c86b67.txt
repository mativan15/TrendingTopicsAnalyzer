I am a complicated person, with simple pleasures. 
As a mum, writer and certified grief recovery specialist, I like to clear my mind and get some quiet time at the end of the day. Sometimes, that means watching a show on Netflix.   
Last week I sat down, snacks in hand, ready to unwind. But instead, I was wound right back up after I read the name, ‘DAHMER' and a preview began to play, trying to lure me in. 
I cringed at the cold dead look in the eyes of the actor playing the renowned serial killer and the word ‘MONSTER' under his name.
