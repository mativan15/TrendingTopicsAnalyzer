Frontier IP Group Plc (LON:FIPP) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 12% in the last quarter. Looking further back, the stock has generated good profits over five years. Its return of 87% has certainly bested the market return! Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 29% decline over the last twelve months.

Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
