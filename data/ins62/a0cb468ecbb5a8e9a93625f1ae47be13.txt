Does that make sense?
The Cardinals did not have a great overall defensive performance. They allowed a season-high 494 yards to the Saints. They allowed 34 points.
The Saints converted 6-of-13 third downs. They allowed nine plays of 15 yards or more and three plays of 40 yards or more.
Chris Olave had over 100 receiving yards.
They did not have a sack.
In previous games, the Cardinals had been fairly stingy but weren't making big plays.
On Thursday, it was the opposite.
