A series of virtual forums will be held this week to gather students' input on the design of upcoming cultural centers in Cole Field House. The spaces, announced by university President Darryll J. Pines last year and slated to open in Fall 2024, aim to foster a more inclusive campus where everyone feels safe, affirmed and that they belong. The new centers will serve as vibrant, centrally located hubs for five communities: Latinx, Asian Pacific Islander Desi American, Native American and Indigenous, multiracial and biracial, and students with disabilities.
