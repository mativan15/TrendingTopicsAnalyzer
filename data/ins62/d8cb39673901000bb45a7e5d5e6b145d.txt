Young ballet dancers learn moves for their audition Wednesday, Sept. 28, 2022 at Fox Hill Dance Academy. Children 6-17 in age auditioned to dance with professional dancers from around the world in the Dance With Us community engagement opportunity offered by the NUTCRACKER! Magical Christmas Ballet troupe. They hope get roles as mice, snowflakes, snow maidens, party guests or other dancer variations.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. On Michigan Road, anyway.

Young ballet dancers gathered on a September night in a small yellow house.
