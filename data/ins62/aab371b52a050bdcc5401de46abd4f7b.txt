"Stranger Things" star Caleb McLaughlin has been a household name ever since the show first premiered in 2016. But it wasn't until recently that the 20-year-old made his first big purchase with his Netflix earnings. McLaughlin tells CNBC Make It that for the first few years after the show was released, he was careful about not spending too much money. The actor, who earns a reported $250,000 per episode, credits his parents with teaching him fiscal responsibility and says they helped him to curb the impulse to spend money unnecessarily.
