Shia LaBeouf first rose to fame in the early 2000s, with roles on "Even Stevens" and in "Holes."

He then starred in numerous high-profile films like "Disturbia," "Transformers," and "Nymphomaniac."

But after singer FKA Twigs accused LaBeouf of domestic abuse in December, his career tanked.

Shia LaBeouf was born in Los Angeles in 1986.
