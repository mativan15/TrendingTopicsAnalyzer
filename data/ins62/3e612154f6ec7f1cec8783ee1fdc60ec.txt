benedek/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Toronto-Dominion (NYSE:TD) is one of the Big 5 Canadian banks, and has been an exceptional choice for dividend growth investors for several decades at this point. They serve more than 9.6 million clients worldwide, and have over $735 B of total investment. Recently, Toronto-Dominion reported Q2 2002 results, and delivered strong performance across their business segments. On top of that, they announced a deal to acquire Memphis-based First Horizon Bank, which I expect will add nice growth to their total assets.
