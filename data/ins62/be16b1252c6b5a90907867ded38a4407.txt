UVALDE, Texas - Those who spend their lives in this remote town in the rolling scrublands of South Texas say there is something here they could never find elsewhere.It is a togetherness, they say, born of innumerable ties of kinship and preserved through the easy rituals of rural life: baptisms and deer seasons, long lunches of carne guisada and summer evenings on the Frio River. Uvalde is a city of more than 15,000 where people still claim to know each other. But since Tuesday, when one of Uvalde's own killed 21 people - including 19 children - at Robb Elementary School, its residents have been forced to consider that they may not have known each other as well as they thought.
