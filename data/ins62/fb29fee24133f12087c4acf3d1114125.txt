Fast-growing insurance brokerage Inszone Insurance Services acquired independent insurance agencies in Colorado and Texas.

Rancho Cordova-based Inszone today announced the acquisition of Proctor Insurance in Houston, and at the end of last week, Inszone bought the insurance business of Precision Services Inc. in Colorado Springs.

Inszone has made multiple acquisitions over two years in both states as it's growing its business nationwide.

These two deals bring Inszone to 25 deals completed this year, and Inszone CEO Norm Hudson told the Business Journal he has a couple of larger deals pending in Southern California.
