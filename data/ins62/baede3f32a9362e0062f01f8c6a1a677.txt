India's financial crime-fighting agency wants to question the two most senior members of the Nehru-Gandhi family, who lead the main opposition Congress party, as it investigates a complaint of money laundering, says the party.
The summons by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is linked to a nine-year-old complaint by a legislator belonging to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) against Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul, the Congress said on Wednesday.
The legislator, Subramanian Swamy, had accused the Gandhis of forming a shell company and illegally gaining control of properties worth $300m.
