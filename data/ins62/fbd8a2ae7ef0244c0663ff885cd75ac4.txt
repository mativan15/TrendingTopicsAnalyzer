Shoppers are being pushed towards veganism as the cost of dairy and meat soars faster than plant-based alternatives.
The cost of dairy milk has risen by 26.7pc compared to this time last year, according to comparison site Trolley, while almond and oat milk have increased by 7.9pc and 8.2pc respectively. 
Meat prices have also risen faster than their plant-based counterparts, in some cases far beyond inflation. The cost of chicken breasts has jumped by 17.4pc, while Quorn chicken-style pieces rose by 10.
