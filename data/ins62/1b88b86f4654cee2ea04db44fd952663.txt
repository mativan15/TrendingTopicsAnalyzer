Carson Wentz is in jeopardy of missing the Commanders' Week 10 matchup in Philadelphia against the Eagles after breaking his ring finger against the Bears on Thursday night.

Wentz fractured a finger on his throwing hand and is in Los Angeles to a specialist, but Ian Rapoport reports that it'll be a four to six-week determination.

Washington hosts the Green Bay Packers on Oct. 23.

If Wentz can't play, Taylor Heinicke is expected to replace him.
