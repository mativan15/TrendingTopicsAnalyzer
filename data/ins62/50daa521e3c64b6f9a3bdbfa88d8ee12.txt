On more than one occasion in the past month, Kiwi ex-soldier Kane Te Tai has thought: 'If we're going to die, then we're going to die.' Since arriving at the frontline in Ukraine, the defence force veteran has worked alongside a humanitarian organisation to stop women and children being snatched by sex traffickers at the border; he's walked towards Russian bombs; taught locals how to deactivate mines; and extracted vulnerable people under heavy shellfire. 'If it's not dangerous, we don't want to stay,' he said.
