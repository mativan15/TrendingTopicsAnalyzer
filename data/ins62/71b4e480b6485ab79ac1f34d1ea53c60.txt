On Feb. 22, self-proclaimed Charlotte business consultant Wynn Charlebois received what he himself described as 'an extremely alarming' email from a California lawyer representing Nannocare Inc.

The heading in bold read, Re: Notice of Securities Fraud: Immediate Cease and Desist Order; Request for Damages.

'We will be immediately filing a lawsuit against you and WC Private LLC. … seeking an emergency injunction in federal court,' attorney Tal Kapelner wrote in the first line.

Kapelner added that Nannocare, a four-year-old manufacturer of organic sanitary pads, will be 'suing for, among other things: 1) Securities Fraud … 2) Identity Theft; 3) Lanham Act (trademark) violations; 4) Forgery, and will be seeking compensatory, special, punitive, and exemplary damages.
