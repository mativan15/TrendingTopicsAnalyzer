Variety - Film News Singapore Bans ‘#Lookatme'Singapore has banned the release of '#LookAtMe,' a feature film by local director Ken Kwek. The InfoComm Media Development Authority said that the film exceeds film classification guidelines because it denigrates a religious community. Supposedly based in true events, the film depicts a man who is offended by a pastor who preaches against homosexuality, but whose behavior contradicts his teachings. The protagonist's viral video about the aberrant priest lands him in jail, causing the man's gay identical twin to fight for justice.
