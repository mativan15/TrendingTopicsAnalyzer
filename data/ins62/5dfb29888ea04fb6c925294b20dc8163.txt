AgenciesYouTuber stars Jay Swingler and Cherdleys will fight in a crossover boxing event tonight. The fight is organised by Misfit Boxing, which is returning on DAZN. Jay Swingler vs Cherdleys will be the headliner for tonight's card. Swingler, a British YouTuber, will take on Cherdleys, an American actor and YouTuber, tonight. The British fighter lost his last bout to AnEsonGib in 2018, while Cherdleys will be stepping into the ring for the very first time. However, reports suggest that the latter had a long fighting background, which he has been shrouding in absurdist humour throughout the fight build-up.
