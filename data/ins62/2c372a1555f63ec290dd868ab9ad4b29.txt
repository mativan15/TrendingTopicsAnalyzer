Between September 15 and October 15, a total of 1,238 stubble fires have been reported across Punjab. 
A total of Rs 4.92 lakh has been imposed as penalty by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) in 190 cases as environmental compensation.
The high number of fires reported this early into the harvest season comes despite the state government distributing around 1.2 lakh stubble management machines under the Centre-sponsored Corp Residues Management (CRM) scheme. A massive awareness campaign has also been launched in Punjab at the village, district and state levels.
