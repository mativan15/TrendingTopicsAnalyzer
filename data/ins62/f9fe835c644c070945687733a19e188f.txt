 B.C. doesn't have the ‘rattiest' city in Canada, but it owns the dubious distinction of taking five of the top 10 spots on the list produced annually by Orkin Canada.
The pest controller ranks cities based on the number of commercial and residential rodent treatments for both rats and mice carried out from Aug. 1, 2021 through July 31, and on the heels of the pandemic it said pestsToronto is the rattiest in the country, but Vancouver is second, Burnaby is third, Kelowna fourth, Victoria seventh and Richmond eighth.
