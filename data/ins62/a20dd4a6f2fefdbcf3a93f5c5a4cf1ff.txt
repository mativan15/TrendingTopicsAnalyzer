Utari Octavianty is no stranger to imposter syndrome. The 28-year-old is the co-founder of Aruna, an Indonesian farm-to-table e-commerce start-up that gives fishermen direct access to global consumers, fetching fair prices for their catch. "When we talked to other [start-up] founders, they came from Harvard, Stanford, and suddenly there's us — from a local university in Indonesia," she told CNBC Make It. "But somehow that became the motivation, it's not the education that matters. It's how we create impact," she said.
