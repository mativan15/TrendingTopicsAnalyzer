WASHINGTON — T.J. Oshie had a goal and assist and the Washington Capitals beat the Montreal Canadiens 3-1 on Saturday night to avoid their first 0-3-0 start since the 2012-13 lockout season.

Conor Sheary and Anthony Mantha also scored for the Capitals.

Down 1-0 after Nick Suzuki's goal, the Capitals got a much-needed spark on special teams that led to three goals in the second period.

After failing to convert on its first nine power-play opportunities of the season, the Capitals made some adjustments to the top power-play unit, placing Dylan Strome on the half wall and replacing Evgeny Kuznetsov with Marcus Johansson.
