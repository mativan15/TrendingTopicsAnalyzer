That's because it is gearing up to report results from its phase 3 pivotal study known as VITAL. This late-stage study is using its cell therapy known as EB-101 for the treatment of patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). Results from this trial are expected any day now before the end of 2022, therefore, this provides traders/investors with a huge catalyst to look forward to.
