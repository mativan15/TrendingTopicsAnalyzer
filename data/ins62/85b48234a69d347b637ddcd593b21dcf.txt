By Reuters Published: 09:43 EDT, 3 June 2022 | Updated: 09:43 EDT, 3 June 2022 By Paul Arnold ZURICH, June 3 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse is likely to remain in the blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) when it is up for a review in early July, even after the crisis-ridden bank has lost about a third of its value since the last index revision a year ago. Its market value is now below that of the SGS testing group, seen as a potential candidate to drop out of the list of Switzerland's 20 largest and most liquid listed companies after more than 17 years in the index.
