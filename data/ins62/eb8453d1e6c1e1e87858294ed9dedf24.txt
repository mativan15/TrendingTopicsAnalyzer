By Australian Associated Press Published: 21:20 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 21:20 EDT, 17 October 2022 Victorian wildlife rescuers expect to find hundreds, if not thousands, of drowned animals when it is safe for them to go out to flood-ravaged areas. Wildlife Victoria has fielded more than 3100 calls from people in the past six days, with animals found distressed, injured, and orphaned because of the floods. Most calls have been about magpies, ringtail possums, eastern grey kangaroos, echidnas and wombats.
