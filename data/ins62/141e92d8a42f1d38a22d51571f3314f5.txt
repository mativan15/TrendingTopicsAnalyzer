Based on data compiled by Credible, mortgage refinance rates have risen for two key terms and remained unchanged for two other terms since Tuesday. Rates last updated on June 1, 2022. These rates are based on the assumptions shown here. Actual rates may vary. With 5,000 reviews, Credible maintains an "excellent" Trustpilot score.What this means: After falling yesterday, mortgage refinance rates are up for longer terms, with 30-year rates back over 5%. Meanwhile, 20-year rates are still under 5%, so homeowners looking to refinance may want to lock in a rate now before rates for this term bounce back up.
