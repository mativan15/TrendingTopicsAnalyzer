West Ham hope Kurt Zouma will be allowed to "learn from his mistake and move on" after the defender was sentenced to 180 hours of community service for abusing his cat.Zouma and his brother Yoan were sentenced at Thames Magistrates Court on Wednesday after both admitted to charges of animal abuse last week.Footage posted online in February showed the West Ham defender slapping, drop-kicking and throwing a pair of shoes at one of his bengal cats in front of his seven-year-old son, while Yoan could be heard laughing as he filmed the incident.
