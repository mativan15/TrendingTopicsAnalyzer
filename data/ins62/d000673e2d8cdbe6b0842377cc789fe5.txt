Google has launched a UK version of an app that lets users interact with the artificial-intelligence system one of its engineers has claimed is sentient.

It is a very limited trial, with just three scenarios to choose from.

And while Google wants feedback about how its Language Model for Dialogue Applications (Lamda) performs, the app users cannot teach it any new tricks.

The company has always maintained the technology, used to power chatbots, has no independent thoughts and feelings.
