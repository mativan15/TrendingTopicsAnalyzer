PHILADELPHIA – Rhys Hoskins raised his arms in triumph, and then spiked his bat in celebration – a raw, emotional moment destined for Philadelphia's rich sports history.Hoskins then trotted around the bases in front of a rabid crowd of 45,538 fans already in a tizzy over the Phillies' first home playoff game in 11 years. The whole thing felt like an out-of-body experience for the veteran slugger.'It's just the moment, man,' he said. 'I didn't know what I did until a couple innings later, really.' Hoskins burst out of his postseason malaise with a three-run homer and slammed his bat in celebration, and Bryce Harper hit a two-run shot that sent Philadelphia to a 9-1 win over the Atlanta Braves in Game 3 of their NL Division Series on Friday night.
