Investing.com-- Most Asian stock markets fell on Friday, and were set to end the week lower as hawkish signals from Federal Reserve officials drove up concerns that rising interest rates could cause a recession.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was the worst performer in the region this week, heading for a weekly loss of 2.4%. Technology stocks in the Hang Seng were hit especially hard by rising U.S. Treasury yields and renewed concerns over a U.S. blockade on semiconductor exports to China.
