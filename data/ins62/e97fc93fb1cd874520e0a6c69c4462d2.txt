Quinta Brunson, the creator and star of 'Abbott Elementary,' is shocked that fans of the show are asking her to write an episode about school shootings.Brunson, 32, took to Twitter on Wednesday — just one day after a gunman entered a Texas elementary school classroom and killed 19 children and two teachers — to question why viewers are reaching out to her — and not their elected officials — to address the mass shootings.'Wild how many people have asked for a school shooting episode of the show I write,' wrote Brunson in a series of tweets.
