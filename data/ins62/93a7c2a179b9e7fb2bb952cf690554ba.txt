A mayor and warden in Antigonish, N.S., have vowed to move forward with a vote on a plan that would see the Town of Antigonish dissolved and the Municipality of the County of Antigonish expanded to absorb it.If a majority of both councils votes for the new plan, the mayor and warden would go to the provincial government and request a special piece of legislation to merge the town and council.That would let them avoid following the Municipal Government Act, which would require a plebiscite and a review from the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board before a municipal merger.
