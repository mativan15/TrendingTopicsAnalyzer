Until now the shortest-serving PM was George Canning who died in August 1827. He spent only 119 days in office. Ms Truss succeeded Boris Johnson as PM after winning a clear victory over Rishi Sunak in a ballot of Conservative Party members. Two days later, Queen Elizabeth II died, the nation entered a period of mourning and normal politics was suspended. But at the end of the week which began with the late Queen's funeral, the seeds of Ms Truss's political demise had already been sown - in then Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget.
