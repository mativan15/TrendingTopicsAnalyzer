JasonDoiy/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images During the last 12 months I published two articles (see here and here) about Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and in both cases I was bullish about the stock and considered it already undervalued. Nevertheless, the stock continued to fall and following that advice until now would have resulted in a loss and an underperformance of the S&P 500 (SPY). Data by YCharts Right now, Intel is trading close to the cheapest level it has been trading for since 2017. And in such situations, one might be tempted to call Intel a bad investment as the stock price is declining further and further and often, we see analysts switching from "bullish" to "bearish" in such a scenario.
