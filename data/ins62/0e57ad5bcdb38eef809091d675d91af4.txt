Y Combinator, a seed stage venture firm that has invested in a whopping 118 startups since summer 2005, has to date only invested capital provided by its four founders: Paul Graham, Jessica Livingston, Trevor Blackwell and Robert Morris. Now they are raising $2 million in capital themselves, from Sequoia Capital and a number of prominent angel investors. Sequoia partner Greg McAdoo is leading the investment.
Sequoia and the angel investors (Ron Conway, Paul Buchheit and Aydin Senkut) aren't investing directly in Y Combinator.
