For most of the 2022 season the Detroit Lions have operated in the relative shadows of the NFL's broadcasting world. The Lions have zero primetime games, and most of the Detroit action has been relegated to the lesser-known broadcast teams of FOX Sports and CBS Sports.
That will change in Week 7, though perhaps not in a way Lions fans will appreciate. Sunday's game against the Cowboys in Dallas will be the featured early-window game on CBS. Which of course means the game draws the network's top broadcasting duo of Jim Nantz and Tony Romo.
