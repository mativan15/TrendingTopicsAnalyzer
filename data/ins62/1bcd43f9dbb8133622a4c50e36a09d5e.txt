Making technology more accessible for everyone is a 'core value' of Apple, the company has said, revealing that the pandemic accelerated some of the work the company has been doing in the area.Sarah Herrlinger, the tech giant's senior director of accessibility policy and initiatives, said that by making devices more accessible for those with disabilities, Apple was ultimately making better products.Last week, the iPhone maker unveiled a suite of new accessibility tools which are being rolled out later this year.
