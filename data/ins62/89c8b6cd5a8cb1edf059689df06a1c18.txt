Given how much he enjoys fantasy football, it shouldn't be surprising that Giants president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi had a lot of thoughts about the slap heard around the baseball world.
Zaidi spoke with Tom Tolbert and Adam Copeland on his regular 'Tolbert and Copes' show appearance on KNBR and said he was in a fantasy football league with Joc Pederson when both were with the Dodgers — which is why Zaidi wasn't shocked to hear about Pederson's actions in the group text.
'He definitely likes to poke the bear, whoever the bear is,' Zaidi said on KNBR.
