Gambling reform and privacy activists have condemned the introduction of facial recognition technology at pubs and clubs across New South Wales, which they say will only risk the privacy of everyone involved, and distract from more robust reforms.

On Wednesday, the Australian Hotels Association NSW and ClubsNSW announced that cameras will be installed in venues across the state from next year to identify gamblers who have registered with the state's multi-venue self-exclusion scheme. The technology is already being used in 100 venues across the state.
