North Carolina and Virginia are getting $58 million from the federal government to help build out anticipated high-speed passenger rail service between the states' capitals. The Federal Railroad Administration announced the grant - the largest of 46 awarded nationwide on Thursday - to begin engineering work on a rail corridor connecting Raleigh and Petersburg, Virginia. The high-speed rail will reach north to Richmond, media outlets reported. The two states have been planning since 1992 for such trains between the capitals, with a route set several years ago.
