Texas Tech golfer Sandy Scott watches his tee shot during Friday's first round of the NCAA championship tournament at Grayhawk Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona.

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Far along in the afternoon wave at Friday's first round of the NCAA championship golf tournament, all 30 teams were over par on a hot afternoon.

Even the best college teams in America couldn't change that. With the eighth-seeded team and the top college golfer in America this year, Texas Tech was not immune.

Tech's five players had only eight birdies among them, four by Ben Hogan Award winner Ludvig Aberg, on a 102-degree afternoon at Grayhawk Golf Club.
