BJP on Wednesday said Mallikarjun Kharge's election as Congress president will not help the moribund party. "Any party can elect their president and it is their internal matter. But Congress is an expired injection and whether you put the sticker of Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, Kharge, Tharoor or any other, it is not going to help the party," BJP general secretary Tarun Chug told ET. "Most of the senior leaders of the party have either left or are willing to leave the party. This is in no way going to affect the national polity of the country.
