Born October 16th, 1925Died October 11th, 2022Although she was born in London, and retained a classic English poise all her life, Angela Lansbury, who has died aged 96, was a Hollywood and Broadway star for more than seven decades, and one who was completely unclassifiable. On her film debut, she played Ingrid Bergman's cockney maid in George Cukor's Gaslight (1944) and was promptly nominated for an Oscar, though she was never to win one. She graduated to play Laurence Harvey's evil, possibly incestuous, mother – although she was only three years older than Harvey – in John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate (1962), and then a dotty amateur witch in Disney's follow-up to Mary Poppins, Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971).
