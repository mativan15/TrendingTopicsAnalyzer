Barely four months before Tripura goes to polls early next year, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury Friday kicked off the election campaign. While addressing a public meeting Yechury urged all secular forces to unite against hatred, violence and communal politics. He added that the country and democracy need to be saved.
Invoking mythological references to target the BJP, Yechury said just the twin brothers, Luv and Kush, had halted Ram's horse after the Ashwamedh yagna in Ramayana, the twin forces of farmers and workers would halt Prime Minister Modi's Ashwamedh yagna.
