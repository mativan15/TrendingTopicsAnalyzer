"Right now, the crypto world is in crisis, having lost trillions of dollars. We're in a bear market," Deepak Chopra recently told CNBC at Gary Vaynerchuk's "VeeCon" in Minneapolis. But the wellness icon says now is a time for investors to focus on the long-term opportunity in financial markets, including crypto. Earlier this year, Chopra's foundation partnered with crypto crowdfunding platform EarthFund to launch a collection of NFT tokens aimed at helping people achieve mental and emotional health.
