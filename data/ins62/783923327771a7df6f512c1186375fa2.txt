Perhaps the only person who gets more television time during Phillies home games than the players themselves is Dan Fitzpatrick, the Mid-Atlantic Region president of Citizens Bank. After all, ballpark naming rights have their privileges. When the Phillies are home, Fitzpatrick can be seen in the bank's seats behind home plate at Citizens Bank Park, entertaining clients while also quenching his own rabid fandom.

For Fitzpatrick, that fandom goes back to childhood. The Northeast Philadelphia native remembers hopping on the Frankford El for Connie Mack Stadium, the former home of the Phillies, at North 21st Street and West Lehigh Avenue as a young boy.
