Bitcoin offices in Istanbul, Turkey, on May 11, 2022.New York State Assemblymember Anna Kelles is tired of all the fear-mongering about the bill she wrote — and sponsored — to place a two-year moratorium on certain types of new cryptocurrency mines in the state. The fate of the measure, which passed the state senate in the wee hours of Friday morning, rests in the hands of Governor Kathy Hochul, who could sign it into law or veto it."It's important to understand that it's not a ban," Kelles said in a call with CNBC on Friday.
