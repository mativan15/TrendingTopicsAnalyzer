AgenciesSena MP Sanjay RautIn the money laundering case involving the Patra Chawl redevelopment in Mumbai, the Enforcement Directorate on Monday wrapped up its arguments over the bail request of Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut. After spending the day in judicial custody, Raut was brought before special judge MG Deshpande on Monday. His jail custody was extended until Tuesday, when his bail request will be further heard. The special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court granted Raut's bail request last month after he was detained in July for his alleged involvement in a money laundering case involving anomalies in the reconstruction of Patra Chawl in Goregaon, north of Mumbai.
