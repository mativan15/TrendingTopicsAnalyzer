The Ontario Securities Commission has found that five men committed insider trading, but two others did not, in a case involving multiple stock trades prior to two acquisitions by Amaya Gaming Group Inc. in 2014.In a 2-1 decision by an OSC hearing panel, newly appointed OSC chair Heather Zordel provided a dissenting opinion that argued all of the accused should be cleared and said OSC staff failed to prove that any insider trading occurred at all.The decision was released Friday by the Capital Markets Tribunal, a new adjudication arm of the OSC that launched earlier this year.
