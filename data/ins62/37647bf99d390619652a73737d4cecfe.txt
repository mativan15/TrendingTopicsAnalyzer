Oct. 19—Ahead of his team's first BCIAA semifinal appearance since 2008, Brandywine Heights coach Jason Miller had a simple message for his team.

"It's been 50 years since Brandywine has been in the next game — the county final," Miller said. "If you can't get excited about this game, you don't belong here."

The fifth-seeded Bullets rose to the occasion, defeating eighth-seeded Oley Valley 1-0 on Tuesday night at Mertztown to advance to the title game for the first time in 47 years.

"We played a great game," Miller said.
