The NBA Finals matchup is finally set.

The Boston Celtics pulled out a dramatic Game 7 road victory over the Miami Heat on Sunday night to capture the Eastern Conference crown and set up a Finals showdown with the Golden State Warriors.

While the Celtics-Heat series went the distance, the Warriors were resting at home after taking care of the Dallas Mavericks in five games in the Western Conference Finals.

On the heels of that strong showing against Dallas, the Warriors are the betting favorites in the NBA Finals over the Celtics.
