Every Super Bowl champion gets celebrated and remembered for its achievement.

But the 1972 Miami Dolphins are immortalized because they're the only team to have a perfect season — undefeated and untied for a full NFL regular season and postseason.

'We've been often imitated but never duplicated,' said guard Larry Little, one of four Hall of Famers who spoke to reporters via web conference on Tuesday ahead of the 1972 team being honored for its 50th anniversary during Sunday night's prime-time game between the current Dolphins and the Pittsburgh Steelers at Hard Rock Stadium.
