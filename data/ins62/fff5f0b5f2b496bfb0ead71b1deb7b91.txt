Gursagar Singh said inspiration for his retro arcade, Singh's Arcade, came after seeing the empty space on a walk. He said there aren't enough activities for young people in the suburbs. (Kwabena Oduro/CBC)Growing up in Montreal's West Island, Gursagar Singh always felt like something was missing. With very few activities for young people in Saint-Anne-de-Bellevue, Singh said he and his friends would kill time between classes at John Abbott College either loitering in hallways or outside on the sports field.
