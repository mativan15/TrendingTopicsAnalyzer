Prime Minister Liz Truss has apologised for threatening the United Kingdom's economic stability after she was forced to scrap her vast tax-cutting plans and embark on a programme of 'eye-watering' public spending cuts instead.
After weeks of blaming the markets and 'global headwinds' for investors dumping the pound and government bonds, Truss on Monday evening said she was sorry for going 'too far and too fast' with her radical economic plan to snap the UK out of years of stagnant growth.
Markets, which plunged after her September 23 'mini-budget', are still under strain even after Truss's finance minister Jeremy Hunt tore up her plans on Monday, and she is now fighting to survive, just six weeks after she became prime minister.
