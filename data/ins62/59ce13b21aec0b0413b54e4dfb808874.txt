Gaming's most unlikely mash-up, between the worlds of Super Mario and XCOM style strategy, works even better than before in this new sequel.
Mario + Rabbids Sparks Of Hope is a very strange game. Not only does it feature Mario dual-wielding a pair of guns and Princess Peach secreting a shotgun in her umbrella but the game itself is a turn-based strategy heavily inspired by XCOM. How director Davide Soliani talked Nintendo into making such a game we don't know (although we did try to ask him) but he's clearly onto something, as 10 million sales later the sequel to Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle is better than ever.
