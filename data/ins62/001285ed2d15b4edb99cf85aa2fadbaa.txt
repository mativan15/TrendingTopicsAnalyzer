The point of a bear market is to bring price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios back down to earth. Preferably into single digits. I like P/Es under ten because it means that the company at least has a chance to pay us back within a decade. Give me a P/E of eight, a business I'm comfortable with and I'll happily wait the eight years. Bonus points if I can get paid to wait, which is where dividend stocks come in. Thanks to this unfolding bear market, we finally have discounts in High Yieldland.
