Volha Maksimava/iStock via Getty Images Introduction I like Federal Agricultural Mortgage (NYSE:AGM) for its very low-risk portfolio. Operating with the full backing of the US government, this company enjoys very low-cost funding which it can apply to offer cheap loans to farmers. The risk tolerance level of AGM is pretty low and this has a direct impact on the non-performing loans: AGM rarely has to write down any of its loans outstanding and that makes this company relatively interesting. Data by YCharts The first quarter was quite satisfying for Federal Agricultural Mortgage AGM's business model is rather simple: it uses its low-cost sources of funding to underwrite loans to farmers.
