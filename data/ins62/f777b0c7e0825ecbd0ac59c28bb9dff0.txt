The owner of the Chinese restaurant whose deliveryman was killed in an alleged duck-sauce dispute says he is barely staying afloat, struggling to find delivery workers — and can't even go near duck sauce now.
'I don't want to touch it,' said Ken Yang, owner of Great Wall in Queens, to The Post on Sunday. 'I can't because it brings back bad memories.'
Yang visibly jumped back when a Post photographer asked the owner if he could pose for a photo holding a duck-sauce container.
Ken Yang, owner of Great Wall in Queens where slain delivery driver Zhiwen Yan worked, said business hasn't recovered since the shooting.
