Chris Carrawell didn't need a lot of time to recognize Paolo Banchero's talent.

Carrawell, an assistant coach at Duke since 2018 who played for the Blue Devils from 1996-2000, remembers seeing him briefly in the summer of 2019 while he was playing for the Seattle Rotary in the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League.

He knew Banchero was talented based on the highlights he saw and because Duke was recruiting him.

Once Banchero enrolled at Duke in the summer of 2021 and started practicing, Carrawell saw why Banchero was a consensus top-four prospect in his high school graduating class.
