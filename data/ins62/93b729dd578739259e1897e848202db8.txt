The much-publicised mohalla clinic project of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), which was launched in 2016, has hit a roadblock with the health department maintaining that there are no guidelines either from the central government or state for implementation of the project.The mohalla clinics in Pune were slated to be set up to provide primary health care to the poor and the needy at their doorstep. PMC had planned to set up at least 50 mohalla clinics during a span of one year on the lines of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) initiative which has been a resounding success in Delhi.
