Once Tre Brown returns to practice, he will likely be thrust into the competition against Mike Jackson, Sidney Jones, and Artie Burns at left cornerback, pushing to get back into the starting lineup after impressing in the Seattle Seahawks secondary as a rookie.

RENTON, Wash. - With rookies Tariq Woolen and Coby Bryant already shining and etching their names into franchise and NFL record books, more help may be on the way for the Seahawks secondary.

According to coach Pete Carroll, second-year cornerback Tre Brown continues to make great progress in his recovery from a patellar tendon injury in his knee.
