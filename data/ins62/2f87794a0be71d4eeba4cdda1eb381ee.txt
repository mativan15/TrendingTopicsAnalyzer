DEAR DEIDRE: EVEN though my business is going down and we're facing financial ruin, my wife won't work or cut back on spending.
Her selfishness is putting me under so much pressure, and I'm worried we'll end up bankrupt and homeless.
I've explained how tight things are and that we can't manage on my income alone but it's like talking to a brick wall
I'm 40 and she's 36. We have two children, aged ten and eight.
She went back to college during the pandemic to retrain but now she's decided she likes the student life.
