Home Depot Co-Founder Bernie Marcus says 40-year high levels of inflation would come down if the Biden administration makes it easier for oil companies to drill in the country.

"We have a president that just doesn't believe in that [oil drilling]," Marcus said on a new episode of Yahoo Finance Presents. "We are sitting on tons of oil and gas, and he doesn't allow us to drill. It's basically stupid. I can't come with another word. It's stupid. And we will continue to suffer this inflation. And our people will continue to struggle with high prices as long as he maintains this facade of climate control versus allowing us to do the things we should be doing,"

Marcus — a long-time Republican supporter — in many respects is toeing the popular party line on the president and oil drilling.
