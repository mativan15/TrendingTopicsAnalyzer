'What else is there to do without electricity in the house?' asked the resident of Beirut as she boiled some water to take a shower.

The 77-year-old Armenian Lebanese woman is afraid that she will fall down while she is carrying the hot water to the bathroom. 'Since the explosion in August 2020, my hip has not been the same, I barely leave the house,' she explained, referring to the Beirut Port explosion, which killed over 220 people and wounded 7,000, and also devastated the capital leaving some 300,000 people homeless.
