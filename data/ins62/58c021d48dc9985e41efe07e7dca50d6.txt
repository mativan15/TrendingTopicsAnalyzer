Bloober Team has gone into more detail on what to expect from the Silent Hill 2 remake, including hints at its revamped combat system.
Konami may have announced four new Silent Hill games and a movie on Wednesday night, but it didn't go into detail on any of them. However, since Silent Hill 2 remake is a console timed exclusive for PlayStation 5, Sony has helped reveal more on the game.
The new Resident Evil style over-the-shoulder camera was one of the few specific things announced last night (although already leaked in rumours) and Bloober Team director Mateusz Lenart has now confirmed that this will lead to them ‘rebuilding the combat system and certain set pieces.
