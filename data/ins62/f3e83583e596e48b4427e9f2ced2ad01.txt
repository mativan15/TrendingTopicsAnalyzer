Desperate Prime Minister Liz Truss didn't vote in the crunch fracking last night which saw MPs erupt in chaos amid angry scenes. Although the vote was about fracking, it was widely described as a confidence vote.A Conservative MP described the chaos in the House of Commons as "inexcusable" and an "absolute disgrace".Sir Charles Walker, the MP for Broxbourne since 2005, told the BBC: "To be perfectly honest, this whole affair is inexcusable."It is a pitiful reflection on the Conservative Parliamentary Party at every level and it reflects really badly obviously on the Government of the day.
