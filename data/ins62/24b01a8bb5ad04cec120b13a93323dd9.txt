Coutinho has not scored or bagged an assist in the 11 games he has played this season for Villa, who sit two spots above the Premier League relegation zone with nine points from 10 matches. "The age he is at and the talent, I very much have full confidence and belief in Phil," Gerrard told reporters on Wednesday, a day before his team's league trip to Fulham.
