When Abdurrahman Mahmud first moved to the U.S. in 2015, he had trouble finding a job that was on par with his level of education and work experience.

He said employers in Minnesota weren't familiar with the university in Ethiopia where he got his nursing degree nor with the humanitarian organizations for which he had worked. So he ended up taking entry-level jobs in packaging and assembly for the first couple of years he was in Minnesota.

"I was not unemployed," said Mahmud, who also goes by Abdu Rahman.
