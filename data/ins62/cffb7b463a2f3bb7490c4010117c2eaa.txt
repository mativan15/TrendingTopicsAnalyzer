Ben Lynch is signing up cafes, food trucks and farmers markets to his app-based payments system which he hopes will rapidly win market share from Visa, Mastercard and Eftpos. Users like cafes and their customers connect their bank transaction accounts to Dolla to make and accept payments more cheaply than through the Visa and Mastercard systems. Lynch reckons a busy cafe could save $20,000 or more a year, if all its customers paid by Dolla. As a marketing stunt to encourage cafes and their customers to start using Dolla, Lynch has announced October 28​ will be 'Dolla Day', on which Dolla payment-accepting cafes can sell coffees to Dolla users for $1.
