Republicans are putting Democratic officials on the spot by using their own words against them.

The Republican National Committee's 'RNCResearch' social media account has been circulating video clips of Biden administration officials, congressional Democrats and the party's candidates during less-than-shining moments in which they appear to be uninformed, unintelligible or far-left extremists.

The strategy has had enough of an impact that Democrats, including the White House, have felt obliged to respond to the tweets.
