Todd English is the latest celebrity chef to embrace cooking with cannabis.

The James Beard award-winning chef and restaurateur recently rolled out his cannabis-infused line of gourmet mac and cheese, the first product launch from his new packaged food brand, LastLeaf.

"We're getting a great response," English told ABC News Live.

The mac and cheese currently comes in two flavors, white cheddar with shells, and a classic cheddar with elbow macaroni.
