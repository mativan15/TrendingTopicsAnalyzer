Far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro and left-wing rival Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva traded jabs and insults as they squared off in their first head-to-head debate in the second and final round of Brazil's presidential election.
Lula attacked Bolsonaro as a 'little dictator' and the 'king of fake news,' while Bolsonaro accused Lula of lying, corruption and a 'disgraceful' record in a two-hour televised debate on Sunday night.
Voters go to the polls on October 30 to choose the man who will become Brazil's next president with 76-year-old Lula, the charismatic but tarnished former president, holding the lead over Bolsonaro.
