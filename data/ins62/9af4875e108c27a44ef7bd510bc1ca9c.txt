George Clooney and Julia Roberts say a certain three-letter word is the secret to their on-screen chemistry and off-screen camaraderie.
 
"The minute we met, we had fun," Clooney, 61, told PEOPLE Monday night at the premiere of their new film, Ticket to Paradise. "The beauty is, when you work with people who take their work seriously and don't take themselves seriously, and that's really fun."
 
"I thought, he's going to be a pal," Roberts, 54, recalled, about the first time she met the actor.
 
The longtime friends, who first teamed up in Ocean's Eleven and then again in Money Monster in 2016, play a divorced couple who reunite to thwart the impending marriage of their daughter, played by Kaitlyn Dever.
