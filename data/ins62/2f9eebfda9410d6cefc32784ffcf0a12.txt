The Ottawa Senators are urging fans to arrive early at the Canadian Tire Centre for Tuesday night's sold-out home opener. More than 19,000 fans will pack the arena for the game against the Boston Bruins, the biggest crowd the rink has seen in years. The team has opened up some standing room-only tickets, but seats are entirely sold out. 'It's been five years since we've had this level of crowd, possibly as many as six,' Anthony LeBlanc, the team's president of business operations, told CTV Morning Live on Tuesday.
