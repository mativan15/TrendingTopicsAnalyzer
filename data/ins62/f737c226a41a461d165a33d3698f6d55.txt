It's been almost four months since the layer-1 blockchain Solana announced its web3-focused smartphone Saga and as the phone is approaching its official release date, the plan has shifted.
'Our goal isn't to sell 10 million units,' Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana, said on stage at Disrupt 2022. 'We would be very happy with 25,000 to 50,000 units sold in the next year, that would be awesome.'
While it's not easy to launch a new phone successfully – as we've seen with countless other companies' efforts – Solana is looking to approach the launch differently, Yakovenko hinted.
