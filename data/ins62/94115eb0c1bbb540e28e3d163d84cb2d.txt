Unity... President of the European Council Charles Michel (Image: GETTY)Under the new deal - thrashed out in a series of heated Brussels debates over the last two days following weeks of talks - the European Union will immediately block more than two-thirds of Russian oil imports.This will rise to 90 per cent by the end of the year.The initial ban will affect only oil which arrives by sea, following opposition from Hungary, whose economy relies on the oil from Russia that comes via pipeline.So far, no sanctions on Russian gas exports to the EU have been put in place - although plans to open a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany have been frozen.
