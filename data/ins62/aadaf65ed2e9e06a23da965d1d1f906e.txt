The New Orleans Saints were an NFC powerhouse under Sean Payton under Drew Brees for over a decade, but have failed to recapture that level of success since their departure.

Since both of their retirement, the Saints have had a number of quarterbacks play meaningful snaps for the organization. They've tried to continue their commitment to winning, but it ultimately hasn't come to fruition.

They'll look to get back on track on the road against a struggling Cardinals team that is completely shell-shocked after only managing to score three offensive points against the Seattle Seahawks.
