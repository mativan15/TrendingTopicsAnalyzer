The New Brunswick government is spending more than $100 million to build hundreds of public housing units over the next four years. The department of social development currently owns and operates 808 public housing buildings, which contain almost 4,000 units. Forty new units each will be built in Saint John, Fredericton and Moncton, with 68 units in northern regions of the province and 192 units in areas of 'greatest need.' Immediate renovations will also be made to 110 vacant units. Most current units are about 50 years old and are in need of repairs and modernization.
