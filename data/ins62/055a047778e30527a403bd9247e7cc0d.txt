Graham Nash 'took full advantage' of the coronavirus pandemic.

The 80-year-old musician used his months in lockdown to throw himself into writing and recording a new solo album, as well as teaming up with his old Hollies bandmate Allan Clarke and he couldn't be happier with the work they've done.

He said: ''I took full advantage of the lockdown. What I've been doing is making music remotely.

'I am one track from finishing a new solo record, done remotely.
