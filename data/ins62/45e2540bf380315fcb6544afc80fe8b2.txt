The U.S. dollar is not just the currency of the United States; it's also, in many ways, the currency of the world. Around half of all global trade and finance is done using dollars. So when the U.S. Federal Reserve takes actions that affect the value of the dollar, it has spillover effects on countries around the world. In the 1970s, many countries in Latin America borrowed heavily in U.S. dollars. Then, in the 1980s, the Fed hiked interest rates to record-high levels, which helped strengthen the dollar and, in turn, made it increasingly difficult for countries to repay those debts.
