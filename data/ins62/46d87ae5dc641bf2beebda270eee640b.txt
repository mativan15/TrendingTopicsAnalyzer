Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said Thursday that the "Border Barrier Mission is working" after the state refused to remove double-stacked shipping containers along gaps in the southern border.  "Arizona is protecting its citizens," Ducey tweeted on Thursday afternoon. "Why the federal government won't is beyond belief." Ducey announced in August that Arizona had filled nearly 4,000 feet of gaps in the border with shipping containers that were welded shut and topped with 4 feet of razor wire.  Construction to place these shipping containers in gaps in the border wall began on Aug.
