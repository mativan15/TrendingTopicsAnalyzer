When investors think of stocks Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -1.07%) (BRK.B -1.27%) owns, they probably think of value-focused investing. For the most part, they'd be right. Berkshire's top holdings are Apple (39%, a value play in 2016 when he first bought the stock), Bank of America (11%), Chevron (8%), and American Express (7%). However, there's at least one stock in the Berkshire that doesn't fall under this umbrella and it excites me the most.
Snowflake (SNOW -6.09%) is a fast-growing tech company that Berkshire Hathaway purchased as pre-IPO shares.
