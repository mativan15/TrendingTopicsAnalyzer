 Load Error Days after the Internal Revenue Service announced big inflation-related bumps to tax brackets and standard deduction payouts for 2023, the tax agency is announcing sizeable increases in the amounts of money savers can put in retirement accounts. People can contribute up to $22,500 in 401(k) accounts and $6,500 in IRAs in 2023, the IRS said Friday. For 401(k)s, that's an almost 10% increase from 2022's contribution limit of $20,500. For IRAs, it's a more than 8% rise from 2022's limit of $6,000.
