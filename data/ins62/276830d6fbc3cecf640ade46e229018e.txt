By Logan DeLoyeOctober 19, 2022A handful of Chicago expressways could be tollways in the near future in an effort to eliminate heavy traffic and promote sustainable mobility moving forward. According to WGN9, the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning recently discussed various proposals that fall under their "On To 2050" plan. 'We've talked to a lot of people experiencing extreme congestion. Managed lanes are a way to think about how do you get to a free-flow traffic lane? Part of that has to do with pricing the lane,' Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning executive director Erin Aleman shared with WGN9.
