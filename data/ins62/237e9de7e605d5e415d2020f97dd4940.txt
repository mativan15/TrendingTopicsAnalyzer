The director of a cryotherapy firm used by elite Premier League football teams has won more than £20,000 at a tribunal - despite being sacked for installing a cryo-chamber that leaked deadly gases which ‘could have led to fatalities'.

David Morris stepped in to fit one of the £80,000 chambers as the company's engineer was unavailable.

But a potentially dangerous leak was found days later which might have killed someone using the hi-tech equipment, an employment tribunal heard.

The 56-year-old, whose LinkedIn profile pictures him with high profile customers such as Wales star Gareth Bale, was later sacked by CryoAction - a company he co-founded - for fitting the device despite ‘not being a qualified engineer'.
