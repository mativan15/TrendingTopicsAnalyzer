Prepare to be knocked out by this harbor-front estate in Huntington Beach, CA. It's the home of UFC champ Jacob "Tito" Ortiz, and it could be yours for $4.5 million.

Ortiz, who defended the Light Heavyweight Championship five times, built the four-bedroom, four-bathroom home in 2006.

Huntington Beach is Ortiz's hometown, and his company, Punishment Athletics MMA, an athletic equipment and clothing line, is based here, too.

The home, which is listed with Baron Bershaw at Compass, was initially priced at $4.
