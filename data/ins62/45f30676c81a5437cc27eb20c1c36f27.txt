Steve Baker doubled down on the Government's pledge to expel Tory MPs who failed to vote with the Government on fracking last night. Chaotic scenes in the Commons yesterday, including U-turns on whether it was a 'vote of confidence' in Liz Truss, have heaped more pressure on the Prime Minister. Despite the chaos, No10 has this morning insisted Conservative MPs who did not back the Government face "proportionate disciplinary action".Mr Baker made this point during ITV's Peston last night, as the Minister for Northern Ireland said Conservative MPs who abstained should have the Party whip removed.
