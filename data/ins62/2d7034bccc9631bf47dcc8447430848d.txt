The French government is to use special constitutional powers to force through its 2023 budget without a parliamentary vote, sparking accusations of 'authoritarianism' from the opposition and underlining president Emmanuel Macron's weakened domestic position since his centrist grouping lost its absolute majority in elections last spring.'It is our responsibility to make sure our country has a budget', the prime minister Élisabeth Borne told parliament, as she put an end to several days of heated parliamentary debate over the government's pro-business budget which ministers said would 'protect' French people from the cost of living crisis while avoiding tax increases.
