Give the Dallas Cowboys credit. They could have packed it in during the first half on Sunday night.

They looked like they were toast when the Philadelphia Eagles took a 20-0 lead. Cooper Rush played like a backup. The Cowboys as a whole looked overmatched on both sides of the ball.

Then things changed after halftime. The Cowboys cut Philadelphia's lead to 20-17 in the fourth quarter. It looked like an epic comeback was possible. Then the Eagles got the one long drive they needed to put the game away.
