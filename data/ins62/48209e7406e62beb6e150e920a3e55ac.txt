It's officially Pride month and one newly-minted collection of NFTs is here to raise money for a number of charities that help queer people.

The world's largest LGBTQ-inspired NFT collection, Pride Icons, completed its inaugural mint of 100 'icons' this Wednesday. Illustrated by artist Max Bahman, the collection offers artistic representations of queer superstars and advocates including RuPaul, Andy Cohen, Lady Gaga and Cher. Each of the 100 NFTs minted is a mosaic composed of smaller images (think rainbow-colored ice cream cones, sequined bananas and more).
