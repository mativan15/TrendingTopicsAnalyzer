The Uptown part of Denver has changed significantly in the last few years.

Along 17th Avenue, long-standing restaurants have closed, including the former LGBTQ bar Hamburger Mary's at 700 E. 17th Ave., where a cannabis store called LivWell Enlightened Health opened last year. A new Hamburger Mary's opened farther down at 1336 E. 17th Ave.

Meanwhile, The Avenue Grill, formerly at 630 E. 17th Ave., has since become Revival Denver Public House, and two other restaurants closed to make way for apartment development along the neighborhood's main thoroughfare.
