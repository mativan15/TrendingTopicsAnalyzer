It's been a little more than a month since the Ethereum merge and one of the big changes that investors were looking forward too has now taken place: ether has become a "deflationary" asset. In crypto terms, that means that the supply of ether is now decreasing rather than increasing. But while many investors hoped that would push the cryptocurrency price higher (assuming there was no change in demand), it hasn't yet happened in a significant way. Despite basic supply and demand dynamics on the network, the macro backdrop still has a strong hold on crypto prices.
