Relief at the U-turn prompted a rally in Europe, which lasted through U.S. and Asian trading. Wall Street's gains were also driven by better-than-expected Bank of America earnings.The U.S. dollar index hit a 12-day low during Asian trading hours, as investors became less risk-averse, although the yen hit a new 32-year low versus the dollar and Japan's finance minister repeated warnings that authorities could intervene.
