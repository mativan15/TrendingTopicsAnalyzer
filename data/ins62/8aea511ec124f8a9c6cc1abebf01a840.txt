Democratic incumbent Michael Frerichs and Republican Tom Demmer are competing for an office that deals primarily in dollars and cents, but issues from abortion to the failed graduated-rate income tax amendment have also found a way into the campaign for Illinois treasurer.

Frerichs, 49, a former state senator from Champaign, has touted his accomplishments over two terms in office, which he said include returning more unclaimed property to residents, starting new investment programs and making significant changes to the state's Bright Start college savings program.
