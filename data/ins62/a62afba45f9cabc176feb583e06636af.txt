The fishmeal and fish oil industry is destroying West Africa's environment and ruining communities. ⁣But the people of Cayar have now filed a legal case against the owners of a fishmeal factory, TPM (formerly Barna Senegal), that's polluting their water and threatening their jobs and access to food. The community wants it shut down. If they win this lawsuit, it will temporarily close the factory. And then the community plans to stop the factory for good.
Fishing communities are raising their voice with Greenpeace Africa to protect local livelihoods and environment that are increasingly under threat from industrial fishmeal factories.
