Real talk about race, identity, and ability has entered the political chat in the U.S. Let's dig in. Last week, the Los Angeles Times shared a leaked audio recording of Los Angeles City Council President Nury Martinez making a series of racist and disparaging remarks about her colleagues and how the city should be governed. Unaware she was being recorded, she said Councilman Mike Bonin, who is white, used his Black son as an 'accessory' and said the boy was 'parece changuito,' or 'like a monkey.' She further mocked the Oaxacan community and said, 'F— that guy … He's with the Blacks,' in reference to Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón.
