Already a Stanley Cup champion, the Wild's Alex Goligoski added another accomplishment to his NHL résumé on Thursday, skating in his 1,000th game against Vancouver at Xcel Energy Center.

"Not a lot of people get to do it," he said. "I feel very lucky."

Goligoski became the 371st player (123rd defenseman) in NHL history to play 1,000.

He's the ninth to reach that milestone with the Wild, following the likes of Zach Parise (2020), Mikko Koivu (2019) and Ryan Suter (2018) as well as fellow Minnesotan Matt Cullen (2012).
