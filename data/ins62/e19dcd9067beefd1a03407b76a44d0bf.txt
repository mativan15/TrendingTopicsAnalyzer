Jun. 5—About a year after merging with a New York company, Forcivity, a Manchester tech company, has been acquired by a Boston-based company.

The company was founded in 2015 as a Salesforce consultancy and system integrator.

Apps Associates, an application advisory services company, bought Forcivity in March. The company provides strategic consulting and managed services for Oracle, Salesforce, integration, analytics and multi-cloud infrastructure, according to its website.

Project demand for Salesforce services is growing, according to Paul Vian, senior vice president of sales and marketing.
