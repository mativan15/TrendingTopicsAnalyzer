Dr. Jackson Avery is coming back to Grey's Anatomy!
 
ABC confirmed to PEOPLE that former star Jesse Williams will return to the medical drama as a guest star and director for the Nov. 3 episode, "When I Get to the Border."
 
Last week, Williams, 41, told PEOPLE he was "always open to the possibility" of returning to Grey's Anatomy.
 
"I love the family that I have on that show. So that's always going to be a form of home base for me," he shared. "And I'll always answer their call."
