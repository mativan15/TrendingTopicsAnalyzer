Apple just released new iPad and iPad Pro models to follow up the latest iPad Air from earlier in 2022 and 2021's iPad Mini. While it's tempting to snag the newest model in pristine condition, you can potentially save a lot of money by going with a refurbished iPad instead. You'd be keeping more electronic waste from reaching a landfill, too. Generally speaking, something that's refurbished -- a refurb for short -- is a used product that's been tested or otherwise reconditioned by either the manufacturer or a third party for resale.
