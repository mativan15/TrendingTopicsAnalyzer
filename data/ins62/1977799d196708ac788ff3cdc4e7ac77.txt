Through six games, it'd be hard to argue that the Ravens are one of the NFL's unluckier teams. In each of its three losses to this point, Baltimore has held a 10-point lead at some stage of the second half. Much of it might be due to Lamar Jackson's dearth of reliable targets, as Mark Andrews seems to be the only weapon he can consistently lean on.
To somewhat address this issue, the Ravens signed long-time veteran speedster DeSean Jackson on Tuesday. For promising young receiver Rashod Bateman — who has missed the last two games with a foot injury — it seems the former first-round pick playmaker isn't happy with the addition of the 35-year-old Jackson to the Ravens' WR corps.
