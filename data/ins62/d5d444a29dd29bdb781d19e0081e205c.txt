Chickens have been generating all the buzz as of late after Malaysia recently announced its export ban on chickens this June 1. Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that the country will halt the export of up to 3.6 million chickens starting June 1. Exports will only resume after domestic prices and production stabilise.   Restaurants in Singapore might feel the heat due to the shortage of fresh chickens. One such eatery is Dickson Nasi Lemak, the takeaway-only shop that opened in the Joo Chiat neighbourhood two months ago.
