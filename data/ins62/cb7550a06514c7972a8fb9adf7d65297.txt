Should the Waukegan City Council place a referendum to change the city's form of government to one run by a city manager on the April 4 election ballot, Illinois law requires voters also decide whether to retain electing aldermen by ward or everyone votes for all council members.

The council's Code, Revisions, Appeals & Negotiations Committee agreed Monday at City Hall to meet before each council meeting through Dec. 19 to educate themselves and learn voters' attitudes before recommending the council vote on the referendums at the last meeting of 2022.
