China's central bank held its key policy rates steady on Monday, which may mean the same holding pattern for benchmark lending rates later this month. The People's Bank of China injected 500 billion yuan ($69.6 billion) of liquidity via its medium-term lending facility, according to an official statement on its website. The MLF carries an interest rate of 2.75%, unchanged from the last operation, and a tenure of one year. The central bank also injected CNY2 billion of liquidity via its seven-day reverse repurchase agreements at an interest rate of 2%.
