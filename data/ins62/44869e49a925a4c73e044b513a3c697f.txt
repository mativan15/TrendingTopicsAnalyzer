Premier Francois Legault has named Eric Girard Minister Responsible for Relations with English-Speaking Quebecers, a move hailed by advocates as 'a major first step' to repairing divisions in a post-Bill 96 province. It's a role Girard pledged to fulfill 'with honesty and justice' during Thursday's cabinet swearing-in ceremony in the National Assembly's Salon rouge, before crossing the room to sit with other newly-appointed ministers – some new to their files, others returning for another mandate.
