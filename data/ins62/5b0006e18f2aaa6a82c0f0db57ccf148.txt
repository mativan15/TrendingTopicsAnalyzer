Steven Gerrard was sacked by Aston Villa on Thursday night after winning just two Premier League games this season. The writing seemed on the wall for a while, as Gerrard was warned by former Liverpool team-mate Jamie Carragher about two "major issues" he needed to resolve. Now his fate has finally been confirmed, it's fair to say he failed to find answers to those problems. Carragher told Gerrard he needed to get the best out of Philippe Coutinho and fix his working relationship with Tyrone Mings as soon as possible.
