British Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned on Thursday (about 1:30am Friday, NZT) – bowing to the inevitable after a tumultuous six-week term in which her policies triggered turmoil in financial markets and a rebellion in her party obliterated her authority. She said: 'I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected.' Her resignation, coming just a month and a half after she was sworn in, means she will become the shortest-serving PM in UK history. Just a day earlier Truss had vowed to stay in power, saying she was 'a fighter and not a quitter'.
