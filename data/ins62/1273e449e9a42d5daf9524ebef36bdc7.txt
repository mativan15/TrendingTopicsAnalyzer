Xiaomi has just announced a new super-affordable TV model for the UK: The Xiaomi TV F2 Series, which launches on June 6 at Amazon UK. The two big attractions here are the price – 43 inches for £339, 50 inches for £449, 55 inches for £499 – and that it has Amazon Fire TV built in as its smart TV software.Fire TV is much slicker and easier to use than the basic smart TV software you get on most cheaper TVs, and has a wider selection of apps and services. In the UK, you naturally get iPlayer, All 4, ITV Hub and NOW, alongside all the big-name international options.
