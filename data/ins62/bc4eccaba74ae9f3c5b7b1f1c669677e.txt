Manchester United are set to be offered Karl Darlow by Newcastle United as part of a swap deal involving Dean Henderson.
Henderson, 25, wants to leave on-loan this summer after falling out-of-favour at Old Trafford. 
Newcastle are thought to be interested in signing the Englishman as their new No.1 goalkeeper for next season. 
According to The Sun, the Magpies believe adding Darlow to their loan bid will help clinch a deal with United who are short of goalkeepers.
At 31-years-old and having played over 200 games, Darlow would provide experienced cover for David de Gea.
