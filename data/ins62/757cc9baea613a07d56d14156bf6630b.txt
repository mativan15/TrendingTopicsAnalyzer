For world, he was a star. A singer, known as much for his songs as the ‘macho man' image he had created with his fondness and unabashed love for guns and bullets. Yet, even with all that stardom, with millions following him on social media, and having contested an election, Sidhu Moosewala was all butterflies when it came to addressing the college from he graduated as an electrical engineer.
'I might have performed in front of 2-4 lakh people on big stages.. but my legs are shaking as I stand here and speak in front of my teachers,' Moosewala had said as he addressed students at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) in Ludhiana last year.
