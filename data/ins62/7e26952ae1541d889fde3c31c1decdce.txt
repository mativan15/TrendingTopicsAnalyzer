In recent years, at least 60 percent of the manufacturing costs of a watch had to be incurred in Switzerland before the watch could be labeled 'Swiss Made.'

Now watches made in Glashütte, Germany, a mountain town of about 1,600 inhabitants near the country's border with the Czech Republic that has long been considered the seat of Germany's high-end watchmaking, are subject to a similar rule.

The regulation affects nine manufacturers, including the internationally known brands A. Lange & Söhne and Nomos Glashütte.
