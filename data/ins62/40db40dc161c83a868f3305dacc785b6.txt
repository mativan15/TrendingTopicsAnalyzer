A comedian crashed the National Rifle Association's (NRA) convention on Saturday to sarcastically thank its chief executive for 'all of your thoughts and all of your prayers' — comments that came days after a shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that left 21 people dead.
'Whenever there's a mass shooting, they all say that Wayne LaPierre isn't doing enough to stop these mass shootings, and even implying that Wayne LaPierre has played a part in making it easier for these shooters to get guns, to get weapons,' comedian Jason Selvig said to an auditorium audience that included the NRA executive.
