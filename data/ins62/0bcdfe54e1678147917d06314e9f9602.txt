The ABEC — as the new council will be known — arises out of the Boston Foundation's Asian Community Fund, which is providing the seed money for its launch. The goal, said fund director Danielle Kim, is for the council to become a standalone nonprofit within three to five years.Kim has been meeting with leaders from BECMA and Amplify Latinx for advice on how to set up ABEC. While there are other organizations that support the local Asian American community, Kim believes ABEC is the first one dedicated to advancing an array of Asian-owned businesses, from access to capital to public contracting opportunities.
