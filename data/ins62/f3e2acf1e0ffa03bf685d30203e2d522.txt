After a middling start to the season, running back Josh Jacobs has put together the best two-game stretch of his career.

He set a new single-game high with 144 yards in the Week Four victory over the Broncos. Then he set another with 154 yards in the Week Five loss to the Chiefs.

While it seemed like Jacobs would be a part of a rotation at running back when the season started, he's re-emerged as the bell cow back he was envisioned to be under the previous Raiders regime.
