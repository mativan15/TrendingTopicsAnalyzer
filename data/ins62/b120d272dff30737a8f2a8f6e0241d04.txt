India's retail inflation had skyrocketed for the seventh consecutive month to an eight-year high of 7.79 (CPI) percent in April 2021, government data showed. Wholesale price inflation, which has been in double digits for thirteen months in a row, surged to a record high of 15.1 per cent in April. While a sizable chunk of the population has been feeling the pinch for a few months now, the global supply issues in food and fuel triggered by the geopolitical crisis of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the heatwave in India that led to a spike in the prices of perishables and the scars left from COVID have accelerated the rise of inflation rates to record highs.
