The State government's move to merge Sericulture Department with Agriculture Department has drawn flak from sericulture farmers' bodies and experts from the sericulture industry in Karnataka.Since long, Karnataka has been maintaining the country's numero uno position in sericulture by accounting for more than 60% of its raw silk production, thanks to the hand-holding by Sericulture Department's extension programme, its technical assistance to the farmers as well as the marketing set up it closely monitors.
