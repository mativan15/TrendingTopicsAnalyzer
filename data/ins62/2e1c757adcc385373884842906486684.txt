Amid Johnny Depp's defamation trial against Amber Heard, social media users are sharing the video of a heartwarming moment from the recently concluded court proceedings. After the closing remarks of Depp's lawyer Benjamin Chew, he can be seen hugging the actor. Both look emotional.
Heard, who was married to Depp from 2015 to 2018, has accused him of domestic violence and sexual assault. She reiterated the accusations against Depp in a 2018 op-ed that she wrote for the Washington Post, without naming the actor.
