JPMorgan's chief strategist Marko Kolanovic is scaling back his bullish calls on the economy as he grows more cautious of the geopolitical and economic risks weighing down the market. Kolanovic, who still predicts the S&P 500 will swing back up 30% by the end of the year, cut the size of his equity 'overweight' allocation, or the expectation of stocks to outperform, in JPMorgan's bank model portfolio, citing central bank policies and escalating geopolitical tensions. 'Recent developments on these fronts—namely, the increasingly hawkish rhetoric from central banks, and escalation of the war in Ukraine—are likely to delay the economic and market recovery,' Kolanovic wrote in a note to clients late Monday.
