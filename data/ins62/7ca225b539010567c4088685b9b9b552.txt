By Kathryn Hardison Shares of Finance of America Cos. Inc. fell 1.2% to $1.66 during after-hours trading on Friday after the company said it plans to discontinue operations of its forward mortgage originations segment by the end of the year. The specialty finance solutions platform said it will wind down those operations across both retail and wholesale channels, which interim Chief Executive Graham Fleming said will allow the company to focus on businesses with greater growth potential.
