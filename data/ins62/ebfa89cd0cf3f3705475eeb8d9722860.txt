Citi analyst Julia Cheung downgraded LexinFintech (LX -6.9%) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $2.44, down from $4.29, citing a "dimmer near-term earnings outlook" after the company reported Q1 results and full-year guidance.
Also, CLSA analyst Ethan Wang has also downgraded to Sell from Outperform.
Despite "soft" loan volume growth in Q1, LexinFintech maintained its loan origination volume growth for 2022 at 10% year-over-year.
