Image source, PA MediaAlex Salmond has criticised the Scottish government's Supreme Court action over a second independence vote. The leader of the Alba party said asking the court to rule on the legality of Holyrood organising its own vote was a mistaken strategy. In a conference speech, he said even if the Scottish case prevailed, such a referendum would be no more than a "glorified opinion poll".The Scottish government said the aim was to achieve legal clarity. Nicola Sturgeon has said her preference is to hold a vote with the agreement of Westminster.
