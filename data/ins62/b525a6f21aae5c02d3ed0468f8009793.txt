Mario Tama/Getty Images News When we last covered Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), we told the bears to "Live Long, & Prosper." Buying VMC at this point is the equivalent of having faith that 150 years of stock market history and valuation metrics are irrelevant. They can of course continue to look irrelevant for some time, but that does not change the final outcome. The company is sound and the US Concrete acquisition should help it get more muscle in Texas. But regardless of what happens in the very short term, at these prices we have to put a sell on it.
