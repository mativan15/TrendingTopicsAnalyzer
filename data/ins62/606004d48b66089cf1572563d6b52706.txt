It seems Uber just isn't content with letting users travel in peace and awkward silence during their point-to-point trips. The ride-hailing company now plans to advertise to users at every point of a trip from the moment you open the app. These ads will potentially appear on multiple screens, blasting consumers with new products with the same subtlety as a clown following the car on a kid-sized tricycle trying to get your attention through the car window.These so-called 'Journey Ads' are meant to hit riders throughout the process of getting an Uber, including requesting the ride, waiting for the ride, and even when you're actually sitting down in the car.
