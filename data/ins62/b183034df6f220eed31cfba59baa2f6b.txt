Dakshina Kannada Member of Parliament Nalin Kumar Kateel said on Sunday that there was no need for the city police to serve notices to the activists of Tollgate Virodhi Horta Samithi by visiting their houses during night hours on Saturday. Talking to reporters, Mr. Kateel said the activists are not criminals. 'They are people who have concern for the district. They should have been called for a meeting. There was no need to issue notices to them. It is a mistake by the officers concerned,' he said.
