Nestlé USA has recalled one of its refrigerated, ready-to-bake products—the Toll House Stuffed Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough with Fudge Filling—due to the "potential presence" of plastic.In a press release, the company said the affected products were produced between June and September 2022 and were distributed in the continental United States and Puerto Rico. According to Nestlé, there have been no reports of illness or injury. However, the company chose to voluntarily recall the cookie dough after "a small number of consumers" called about the presence of "white plastic pieces" in the product.
