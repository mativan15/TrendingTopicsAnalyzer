AgenciesThe word game Wordle is laid up on a 5X6 grid and challenges players to guess the word by typing characters into a labyrinth box. Letters for each attempt are highlighted in various colors. If a box becomes green, it means the letter is part of the word of the day and is in the correct spot. If any boxes become yellow, it signifies the letter is in the Wordle but does not belong in the location specified. If any of the letters typed is not part of the word, the box goes grey. If you find Wordle to be too easy, try its "Hard Mode" to give your brain a more difficult task.
