Poland will only receive the money from its 35.4-billion euro ($38 billion) post-Covid economic recovery package if it carries out rule of law reforms, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday.She said the EU's approval of the plan announced on Wednesday was "important" but only "a first step, as the money will be disbursed when the reforms and investments are in place"."We are not at the end of the road on the rule of law in Poland," she said, speaking alongside Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and President Andrzej Duda on a visit to Warsaw.
