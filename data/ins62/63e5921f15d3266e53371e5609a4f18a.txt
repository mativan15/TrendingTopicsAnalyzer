Construction started this week on the multimillion-pound Justice Quarter on Fleet Street in London. By 2026, the complex will house 18 courts and the headquarters for the City of London police.Unveiling the foundation stone, Brandon Lewis looked more like an auctioneer than the justice secretary, with a gavel positioned on the lectern. English courts have never used gavels, but seemingly no one told the City of London Corporation, which is funding the development.A handful of local residents had gathered to protest against money being spent on the development.
