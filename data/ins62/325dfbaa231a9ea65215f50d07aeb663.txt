The United States may tip into a recession next year, but it is possible that inflation can be tamed without causing too much economic pain, Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer David Solomon told Reuters. "There's a reasonable chance of a recession in the U.S., but it's not certain," Solomon said on Tuesday after the company released third-quarter earnings. "I could still see a scenario with a soft landing." Solomon's comments echoed those of JPMorgan & Co CEO Jamie Dimon in expressing caution about the economic outlook.
