Shares of Winnebago Industries Inc. fell more than 12% after the company reported better-than-expected results for the fiscal fourth quarter, but said various factors could weigh on demand for its RVs in the year ahead. Inflation and rising interest rates are hitting demand for the company's boats, motorhomes and trailers at dealerships, Chief Executive Mike Happe said on a conference call with analysts. He said demand may also be normalizing after it surged during the pandemic as Americans splurged on pandemic-safe recreational activities like boating and road trips.
