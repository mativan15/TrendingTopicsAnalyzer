France is wooing Indian companies, particularly startups, for investments after it topped for the third year in a row an EY survey on most attractive investment destinations in Europe. Emmanuel Lenain, Ambassador of France in India, said President Emmanuel Macron leads the most pro-business regime which has brought labour reforms, reduced corporate tax and provided for a flat tax on capital gains to make it easier to do business in the country. The nation is becoming a hub for batteries and EVs, which are of interest to India as well.
