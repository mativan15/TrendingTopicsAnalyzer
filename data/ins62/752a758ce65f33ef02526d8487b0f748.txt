Grocery-delivery company Instacart Inc. is delaying its long-awaited initial public offering because of poor market conditions, according to news reports Thursday. The New York Times first reported Thursday that the San Francisco-based company has halted its IPO plans, and is awaiting more favorable conditions. Later Thursday night, the Wall Street Journal confirmed the report, citing a memo from Instagram CEO Fidji Simo saying an IPO will be 'highly unlikely' this year. The IPO market has been severely curtailed this year following a record-setting 2021, as the stock market has slid amid high inflation and recession fears.
