Venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is not on board with the founder's vision to break up MakerDAO, one of crypto's largest decentralized finance protocols, into smaller units.

A16z, an investor in Maker with power to sway votes in decision-making, layed out its own vision for the protocol's path forward, pushing back against some arguments of MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen's 'Endgame' manifesto on how to make Maker more decentralized and censorship-resistant.

Maker is a cornerstone of decentralized finance, where users withdraw and lend crypto in an automated manner.
