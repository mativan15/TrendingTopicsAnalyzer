The Hindu Janajagruthi Vedike has relaunched its campaign against halal meat in Karnataka ahead of Diwali, asking Hindus to boycott products and companies, such as McDonalds and Pizza Hut, that use meat certified to have been prepared as per Islamic law.
Ramesh Shinde, a spokesperson for the fringe right-wing outfit, alleged that a 'parallel economy was being run through halal certification', which he said was not permitted by the government of India. 'Halal is only for Muslims. Why is it being imposed on Hindus and people of other religions?' he said.
