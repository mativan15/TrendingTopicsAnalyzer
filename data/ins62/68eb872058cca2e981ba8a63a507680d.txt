As the enthusiasm around AI image and text generators grows, Jasper, a startup developing what it describes as an 'AI content' platform, has raised $125 million at a $1.7 billion valuation. The tranche is the company's first, remarkably, and comes as Jasper acquires AI startup Outwrite, a grammar and style checker with over a million users worldwide.
CEO Dave Rogenmoser tells TechCrunch the funding will be put toward building out Jasper's core products, improving the customer experience and bringing Jasper's technology to more apps.
