Netflix added 2.4-million customers in the third quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations and said it expected to add another 4.5-million in the current quarter. The company 'may be getting back on track in terms of content consistency, and it carries good momentum into the fourth quarter,' said JPMorgan Chase's Doug Anmuth, in a note on Wednesday. Anmuth returned to an overweight rating on the stock, six months after downgrading it to neutral. 'Thank God we're done with shrinking quarters,' Netflix co-founder and chair Reed Hastings said during a webcast interview with Anmuth on Tuesday.
