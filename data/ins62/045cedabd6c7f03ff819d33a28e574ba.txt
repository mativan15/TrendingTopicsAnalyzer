Steelers legend Ben Roethlisberger doesn't sound jealous of Tom Brady. 
After watching his former Steelers team defeat Brady's Buccaneers, 20-18 on Sunday, the former Pittsburgh quarterback said it looked like he was 'watching a different Tom' — who was seen yelling at his linemen while Tampa Bay trailed Pittsburgh at the end of the first half. 
'I was up there just happy as can be watching the game,' Roethlisberger said during the latest episode of his 'Footbahlin with Ben Roethlisberger' podcast.
