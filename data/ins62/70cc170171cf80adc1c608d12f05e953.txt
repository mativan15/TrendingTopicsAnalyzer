Stock splits are encouraging developments because they mean that a stock has been performing well. At a high price tag, the company can justify slashing the stock price in half (or more) so that it becomes accessible to a wider pool of investors. Alphabet recently announced a mammoth 20-for-1 stock split that will take place in July. 
However, not all stocks are going in that direction. Some have to take on reverse stock splits simply to stay on a major exchange like the Nasdaq or NYSE if their shares fall below $1.
