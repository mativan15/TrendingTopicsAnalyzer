Members of Trans Action Warwick shouted "Tory scum" at the Education Secretary outside the talk on Friday, as well as waving flags and placards stating "Trans rights are human rights". The Telegraph reported that one protester had struck one member of the university's Conservative Association on the head, although they were uninjured, while Mr Zahawi was ushered away by campus security guards. In a statement issued by Warwick Pride before the talk, they referred to comments made by Mr Zahawi regarding Kathleen Stock, a former lecturer at the University of Sussex who has been criticised for her views on trans rights and left the university following protests against her.
