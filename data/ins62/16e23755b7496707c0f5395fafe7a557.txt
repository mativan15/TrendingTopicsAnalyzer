George Munsey's unbeaten 66 off 53 balls underpinned Scotland's 160-5 after they lost the toss, with important cameos from Calum MacLeod (23 off 14) and Chris Greaves (16 not out off 11). The Windies raced to 53-1 but Evin Lewis was out from the penultimate ball of the powerplay, the start of a dramatic collapse that saw the 2012 and 2016 winners lose seven wickets for 26 runs in 45 deliveries. It was the decisive moment in both sides' opening Group B encounter in this first round, with Mark Watt, so often crucial to Scotland's success, shining as the Windies were rolled for 118 in 18.
