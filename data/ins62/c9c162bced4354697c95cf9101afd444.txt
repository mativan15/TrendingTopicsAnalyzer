The Winnipeg Blue Bombers may be swapping their lineup this week, but the B.C. Lions know they're still in for a tough test against the CFL's top team.With first spot in the West locked up, the Bombers (14-2) are opting to rest several stars when they face the Lions in Vancouver (10-5) on Saturday.For B.C. head coach Rick Campbell, it doesn't really matter who's on the other side of the field.'You take a look at their roster, there's a whole bunch of really good football players and I know they're gonna play hard like they always do,' he said.
