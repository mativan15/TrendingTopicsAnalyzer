American musician Beck has scrapped the upcoming North American tour of Arcade Fire after the band's front-man Win Butler was accused of misconduct. Beck was slated to perform the opening act for the tour, which was scheduled to start on October 27. According to media reports, Arcade Fire sent an email to the ticket buyers stating that Beck won't be available for the show and that Boukman Eksperyans would replace him. Beck was booked to perform 18 shows for the American rock band and became the second name to ditch the band.
