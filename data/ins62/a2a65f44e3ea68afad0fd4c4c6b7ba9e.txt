Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt scrapped plans to cut taxes and signaled consumers would shoulder more of the increase in energy prices from next April as he set out a package of measures to get a grip on the public finances.

Hunt said income tax cuts the government had planned would be shelved indefinitely, and he reversed plans to slash dividend tax rates and scrap alcohol duties.

The measures reverse more of Prime Minister Liz Truss's growth program, which prompted a selloff in UK assets after it was unveiled by her then-chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng.
