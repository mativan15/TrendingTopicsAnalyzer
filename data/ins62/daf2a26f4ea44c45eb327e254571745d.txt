New York Giants head coach Brian Daboll is open to joint training camp practices this year but on Thursday, stopped short of saying anything had been finalized.
'Yeah, we're working on that. Maybe, maybe not. That's the best answer I can give you. I don't have anything concrete,' Daboll told reporters.
Although it's still not concrete, joint practices do appear likely. And ESPN's Jordan Raanan reports that Big Blue's 2022 counterpart will be the New York Jets.

The Giants and Jets are likely to hold a joint practice in the week leading up to their Aug.
