Thanks!For the past year or so, I've been speaking all over the country about free-speech problems at American law schools. The institution that figures most prominently in my talks is Yale Law School—partly because it's the longtime #1 law school and top producer of law professors and deans, making it a trendsetter in legal academia; partly because it's the school I know the best, as my alma mater; and partly because it has had more high-profile controversies over free speech and cancel culture than any other school.
