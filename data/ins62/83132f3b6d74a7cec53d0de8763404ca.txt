(NASDAQ: VTSI) ('VirTra'), a global provider of judgmental use of force training simulators, and firearms training simulators for the law enforcement and military markets, has introduced a breakthrough technology for the industry, 'VirTra Volumetric Video', or 'V3™', which has the potential to provide a step-function change in training content.
