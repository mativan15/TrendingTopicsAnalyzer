The Active Network Group of Emergency Lifesavers (ANGELS), a project launched in Kozhikode with the support of the district administration and doctors to streamline the operation of ambulance services and transform the ambulance drivers as emergency lifesavers is almost on the verge of being discontinued due to lack of government patronage and financial support. A control room set up in 2011 connecting about 250 ambulances in Kozhikode under a helpline number is not functional now under the ANGELS' network.
