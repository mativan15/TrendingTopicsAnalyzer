In 'Darkest Hour,' when members of his Cabinet press for a negotiated peace with Nazi Germany, Winston Churchill roars: 'When will the lesson be learned? When will the lesson be learned? How many more dictators must be wooed, appeased — good God, given immense privileges — before we learn? You cannot reason with a tiger when your head is in its mouth.' Elon Musk, take note.
