Dr. Jill Biden is honored to be first lady of the United States — but she still recognizes the importance of work.

"I understand a woman's need to have something for herself," Dr. Biden, 70, tells Harper's Bazaar for the magazine's latest cover story.

Much of her focus on independence, she tells Bazaar, stems from her first divorce.

In 1970, the now first lady married former college football player Bill Stevenson, taking the name Jill Stevenson.
