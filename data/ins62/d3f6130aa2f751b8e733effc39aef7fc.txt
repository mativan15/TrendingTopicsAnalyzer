Under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) norms, every individual or business who clocks a yearly turnover of more than INR 40 lakh or INR 20 lakh or INR 10 lakh, depending upon which state their business operates in, they have to register for the GST.  The GST registration is an online process which is carried out by the government via its GST website.  Once a business is registered under the GST, they are provided with a unique registration number known as the Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTIN), which is a 15-digit number given by the government to the taxpayers after attaining the GST registration.
