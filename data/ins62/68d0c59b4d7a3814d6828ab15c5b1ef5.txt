seoul, south korea — 
The fate of a top Iranian female athlete was unclear Tuesday after she competed in an international rock-climbing competition in South Korea without wearing the head covering mandated by her country's government.
Elnaz Rekabi received global headlines after she participated in the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) Asian Championships in Seoul with her hair tied back in a ponytail, rather than a hijab. Her decision was especially notable considering the women-led protests that continue to simmer across Iran following last month's death of a young woman who had been detained for breaking the country's strict hijab laws.
