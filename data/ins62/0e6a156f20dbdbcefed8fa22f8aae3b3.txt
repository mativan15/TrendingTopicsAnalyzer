By Reuters Published: 21:19 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 21:19 EDT, 18 October 2022 Colorado and Oregon State are both coming off victories but with different perspectives on those triumphs. The Beavers' 24-10 win over Washington State moved them one win away from becoming bowl eligible, while the Buffaloes were happy to get rid of the donut at the front of their record. Colorado (1-5, 1-2 Pac-12) can make it two straight and show its 20-13 overtime win against Cal last week wasn't a fluke when it travels to Corvallis, Ore.
