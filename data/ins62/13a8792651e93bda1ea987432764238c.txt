The Archbishop of Canterbury has taken aim at Liz Truss, warning that he is 'deeply sceptical' about trickle-down economics.
The Most Rev Justin Welby, who made the remarks while on a tour of Australia, said that if rich people have money they are more likely to save it than spend it.
He argued that a better way to generate spending in the economy would be to put more money into the pockets of those who need to buy food.
'I'm not going to make a party political point because both parties are deeply divided and I'm not going to talk about Australia because I just don't know the situation,' he told The Guardian.
