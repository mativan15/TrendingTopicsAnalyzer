By Reuters Published: 14:09 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 14:09 EDT, 19 October 2022 The Washington Capitals placed Connor Brown on injured reserve Wednesday but said the forward will be sidelined long term with a lower-body injury. The team has yet to determine if Brown will require surgery. As it stands, Brown has to miss at least seven days. The Capitals recalled forward Beck Malenstyn from Hershey of the American Hockey League in a corresponding move. Brown, 28, was injured in Monday's game against Vancouver after taking a hit from Canucks defenseman Noah Juulsen along the boards.
