24 hours after Namibia stunned Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka, the tournament's first group stage produced another major upset by an associate member nation as Mark Watt's sensational 3-12 led a quite brilliant Scottish bowling display. Opener George Munsey's unbeaten 66 off 53 balls either side of a rain delay provided the backbone of Scotland's 160 for five, but West Indies made a fast start to the chase and were in control at 52 for one inside the final over of the powerplay.However, Evin Lewis' departure started a collapse of seven wickets for 26 runs in 45 balls as Watt - who consulted a page of handwritten notes between deliveries - and Michael Leask (2-15) came to the fore.
