LONDON: Global shortages of middle distillates such as diesel, gas oil and heating oil are intensifying rather than easing - making it more likely a relatively severe slowdown in the business cycle will be necessary to rebalance the market:* US inventories of distillate fuel oil depleted to 106 million barrels on Oct. 7, the lowest seasonal level since the government began collecting weekly data in 1982.* EU distillate inventories were just 360 million barrels at the end of September, the lowest seasonal level since 2004.
