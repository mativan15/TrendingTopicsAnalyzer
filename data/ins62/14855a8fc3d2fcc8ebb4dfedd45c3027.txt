There are typically two approaches NBA teams have for their preseason finale: Keep experimenting with the expected rotation players as part of a 'dress rehearsal' or give them a rest before the games start to matter in the standings.

Both approaches were on display in the Orlando Magic's 114-108 preseason-ending win over the Cleveland Cavaliers Friday at Amway Center.

While the Cavaliers sat three starters in Darius Garland, Donovan Mitchell and Jarrett Allen, the Magic continued to tinker.

Orlando used its fifth different starting unit in as many games, with Cole Anthony, Franz Wagner, Paolo Banchero, Wendell Carter Jr.
