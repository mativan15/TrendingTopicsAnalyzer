U.S. Politics Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, predicted Thursday that a "national divorce" is coming after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) voted to add the COVID-19 shot to its recommended vaccine schedules for children and adults.The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) unanimously approved the addition. ACIP member Dr. Nirav Shah said the decision Thursday does not mean the shots will be mandated for children, Reuters reported.
