My late father, may he rest in peace, was a two-footed driver. Left foot on brake and right on gas. As my brother and I entered teendom and got our licenses, we frequently told him this wasn't a great idea, as he was prematurely wearing out his brakes and diminishing his miles per gallon. Yes, we actually talked about that in our family in the early '70s. Even with our corrective actions, he continued to do this throughout his motoring days.

Mr. Random strikes again? Nope. We, the United States, are basically (on a macroeconomic level) doing the same thing in the second quarter of the 21st century.
