President Biden is getting behind the wheel to promote electric vehicles (EVs) in an appearance on Jay Leno's auto-centric CNBC show.

CNBC released a preview of the season seven finale of 'Jay Leno's Garage' on Thursday. On the show, Biden and the former 'Tonight Show' host visit a Secret Service training facility to talk cars as Leno rides shotgun in an electric 1978 Ford F100 truck.

Calling EVs a 'gigantic part' of the bipartisan infrastructure law passed last year, Biden says, 'We're talking about putting 500,000 charging stations and the money for those charging stations in that bill, in addition to the charging stations individual companies are putting in.
