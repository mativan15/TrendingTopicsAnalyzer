You flip and you will flop. 
After an abrupt end to US housing demand just six months ago, home flippers who were winning big are now facing major losses. 
As interest rates rise to an all-time 15-year high of 7.5%, buyer demand has been crushed. 
Tammi Merrell, a flipper out of Denver described her plight as a 'high-risk, high reward business.' 
'Now we're facing the high risk,' Merell told Bloomberg. 'I'm just praying for break even.'
While both buyers and sellers are feeling the burn, home flippers have been hit the hardest.
