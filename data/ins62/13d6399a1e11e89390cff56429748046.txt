Shortly before wading into New York politics on Sunday by endorsing Rep. Lee Zeldin's Republican run for governor, former President Donald Trump criticized American Jews, claiming they are insufficiently loyal to Israel.

'U.S. Jews have to get their act together and appreciate what they have in Israel - Before it is too late!' Trump wrote in a cryptic post on his Truth Social platform, deploying an anti-Semetic trope.

The post drew arched eyebrows, cast a shadow over his endorsement of Zeldin and continued to draw rebukes as the work week began Monday.
