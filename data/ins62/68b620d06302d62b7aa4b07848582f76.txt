The president of Iran's national Olympic committee claimed Thursday that an Iranian competitive climber who had participated in an event without wearing her country's mandatory headscarf will not be penalized. Speaking to The Associated Press in the South Korean capital of Seoul, Mahmoud Khosravi Vafa said there was no reason to take disciplinary measures against 33-year-old competitive climber Elnaz Rekabi, because not wearing a headscarf, or hijab, was an "unintentional" act on her part."It's a small issue.
