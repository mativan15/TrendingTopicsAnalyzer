Businesses have suffered a trade slump and a sharp drop in cash reserves as economic pressures mount, according to new data.More than a quarter of companies said their turnover decreased in September, reflecting slower trade and reduced sales, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found.The hospitality industry suffered the biggest declines last month as businesses face higher costs and waning demand from cash-strapped consumers.More than half of companies in the accommodation and food services sector said that turnover dropped in September, compared to August – double the average across all sectors.
