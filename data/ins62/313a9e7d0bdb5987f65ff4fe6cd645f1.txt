kmatija The selloff in REITs and evaporation of enthusiasm for cannabis equities (MSOS) have led to a rough ride for New Lake Capital Partners (OTCQX:NLCP) shares since its IPO last summer, with shares down 46%. Despite a spotless balance sheet and strong tenant roster, NLCP screens as one of the cheapest REITs and yields nearly 10%. While shares are likely to remain volatile, I believe NLCP shares represent a compelling value at today's price. NewLake listed on the OTC exchange in August 2021 at a price of $26, raising $93 million (after fees).
