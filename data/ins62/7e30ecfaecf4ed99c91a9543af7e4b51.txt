Tom Gozney with the Dome

AN ENTREPRENEUR whose outdoor ovens are used by the likes of Richard Branson, Gordon Ramsay and Paul Hollywood is seeing rapid growth after taking his business to the US.

Tom Gozney is the founder of Gozney Limited, which went from making commercial ovens to producing portable pizza ovens that people could use in their gardens.

Its latest product, the Gozney Dome, recently went on sale in the UK. Retailing for £1,199, it was an instant success at its US launch, with eight million dollars of sales online in five hours.
