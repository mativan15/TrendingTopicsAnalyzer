Moynihan when Yahoo Finance Live asked him at the World Economic Forum whether he felt like the company was missing out on the next big thing by not aggressively moving into crypto (full interview above).Moynihan — who has driven a major digital banking transformation as BofA's CEO for the last 12 years — explained the bank is heavily regulated and that prevents an all-in maneuver into crypto.
