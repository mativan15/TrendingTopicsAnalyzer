Cash-strapped energy companies that take out Covid-style support loans this winter will be forced to draw up net zero plans and will be banned from paying dividends and bonuses. 
The £40bn Energy Markets Financing Scheme, announced by the Government and the Bank of England last month, will provide emergency cash to help suppliers, generators and shippers facing soaring gas and electricity prices. 
But as the scheme opened on Monday, companies were told that those seeking assistance will need to agree to strict conditions.
