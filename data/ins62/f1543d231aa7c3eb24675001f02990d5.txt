Fresh off of their second trip to the College World Series in three tries, Auburn Baseball is picking up where they left off.
The Tigers hosted Louisiana Tech for a fall exhibition game on Saturday and needed an epic comeback to finish off the Bulldogs. Newcomer Brody Wortham hit the go-ahead home run in the 10th inning to cap the six-run comeback, which ultimately lifted Auburn to a 12-11 win.

The home run was the second hit of the day for Wortham, who doubled in two runs earlier in the inning to begin the comeback.
