Over the next few years, all seven members of BTS will fulfill their mandatory military service in South Korea, extending the group's previously-announced hiatus until 2025. But, luckily for that all-important other ARMY, the news doesn't mean BTS won't still be around in some capacity.

On Tuesday, Oct. 18, a spokesperson for the Korean Defense Ministry said the members of the group will be able to take part in specific 'national-level' events even as they complete their service, according to The Korea Times.
