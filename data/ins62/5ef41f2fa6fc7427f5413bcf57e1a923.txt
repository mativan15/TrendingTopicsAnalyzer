The US Presidential administration has reportedly clashed with the UK over the imposition of "unnecessary obstacles" for US defence firms aiming to operate in the UK. It's been reported that the Biden administration has threatened, if restrictions are not removed, to limit its sharing of intelligence. The row has reportedly kicked off over the takeover of British firm Ultra Electronics, a supplier of secret tech to nuclear submarines. Cobham, the private equity-backed buyer, is another UK defence business.
