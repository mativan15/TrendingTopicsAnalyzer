KALYAN: Angered over his 28-year-old girlfriend's decision to marry someone else, a 33-year-old married man from Nashik strangulated her with a nylon rope and then hanged himself with the same rope at the Palava City township in Dombivli (East) on Tuesday.

Anil Salunke ran a small business and his girlfriend, Lalita Kale, was employed with a private company. Kale lived with her mother and younger sister in a rented flat at Casa Rio Gold in the complex, said the police. They had been together for five years and Salunke used to frequent his girlfriend's flat.
