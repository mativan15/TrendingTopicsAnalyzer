Grandbrothers/iStock Editorial via Getty Images TG Therapeutics (NASDAQ:TGTX) is trading lower in the morning hours Wednesday after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pulled the marketing authorization granted for its lymphoma therapy Ukoniq. The decision follows a request made by the company to withdraw the approval and waive its opportunity for a hearing, the FDA said. In February, the regulator greenlighted Ukoniq for certain adult patients with relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) under accelerated approval.
