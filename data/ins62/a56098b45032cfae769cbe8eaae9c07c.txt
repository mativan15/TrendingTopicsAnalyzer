"There's nothing more rewarding than getting in early, and playing a major role in a company's rapid growth." Harkness said. "My goal is for Swoogo to be the most partner-friendly player in the event tech space.  I want partners to love Swoogo as much as its customers do. And that's a tall order."

Harkness is no stranger to the path of a successful tech start-up. In 2018 he became the Director of Strategic Alliances at Looker, a global, multi-cloud data analytics platform founded in 2012. When Harkness joined Looker, he became an integral part of the partnership leadership team.
