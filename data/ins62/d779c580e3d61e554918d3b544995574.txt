The Highlander Institute team is devastated by the recent mass shootings in Buffalo, NY targeting a Black community and Uvalde, TX targeting children and teachers, and we are mourning all the precious lives unjustly taken in these tragedies. We are currently dedicating our attention and energy to reflecting with and supporting our team and school communities as each of us works to grieve, to understand our power, and to provide support.
