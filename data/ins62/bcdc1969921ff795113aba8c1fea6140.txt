Tom Cohen boarded a bus in Beersheba heading to Tel Aviv, his mandolin safely tucked in his backpack. Lacking money to pay the tuition at the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance, he was on his way to impress a high-level banker into offering him a scholarship.

Yaffa Israeli, then head of international banking at Israel Discount Bank and founder and chairman of the Ronen Foundation, had been a patron of young violinists, pianists and aspiring opera singers. Would she grant a scholarship to the visiting mandolin player?

He walked into her office woefully disheveled – shorts, t-shirt, flip-flops – took out his mandolin, and without a word, began to strum and pick, his fingers dancing on the strings.
