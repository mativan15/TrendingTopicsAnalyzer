LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - British Conservative lawmaker William Wragg said on Wednesday he had submitted a letter of no confidence in Prime Minister Liz Truss after being "ashamed" of the mini-budget she set out last month which caused turmoil in financial markets.

The government has told lawmakers that a vote on Truss's fracking policy later on Wednesday would be treated as a test of confidence, and those who vote against it will be removed from the parliamentary party.

Wragg said that although he opposes fracking, he would vote with the government so that he would not be removed from the parliamentary party.
