You can do anything in Las Vegas (more or less) but some employees want to end one vice that has long been associated with casinos.

Las Vegas caters to every vice.

The city caters to gluttony with its endless supply of restaurants and all-you-can-eat buffets that range from absurdly cheap to decadently expensive. Sin City has greed covered as people try to win at the tables and slot machines.

Lust, as you might imagine, happens all over the city in bars, strip clubs, and in the many adult-themed shows.
