Jeremy Hunt said the support would be reviewed so it cost taxpayers "significantly less than planned". However, he said the government would still ensure there was "enough support for those in need". It comes as energy bills have soared as Russia's invasion of Ukraine drives up wholesale gas prices around the world.Mr Hunt said he had agreed with Prime Minister Liz Truss that it would be" irresponsible for the government to continue exposing the public finances to unlimited volatility in international gas prices".
