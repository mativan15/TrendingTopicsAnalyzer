While many fans were curious as to why Hellena Taylor wasn't returning to voice Bayonetta in the upcoming Bayonetta 3, she has taken to Twitter to explain why this happened. Across four Tweets, Hellena Taylor explains that she was only offered $4,000 to voice Bayonetta in Bayonetta 3 (shown below). As she had already voiced the character in the first two games, and done a magnificent job at that, it would be logical that she would return for the third outing.
