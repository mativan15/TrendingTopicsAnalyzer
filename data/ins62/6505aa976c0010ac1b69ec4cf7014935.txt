It turns out that zooming in on an ant's face is an absolute nightmare.

A close-up photograph of an ant was sent in as a submission to the 48th annual Nikon Small World Photomicrography Competition — and the results are freaky.

The tight shot of the tiny insect, captured by Dr. Eugenijus Kavaliauskas of Taurage, Lithuania, shows the ant's beady red eyes, angry expression and what appears to be long, sharp teeth.

Kavaliauskas captured this photo of the ant by using reflected light with 5X objective lens magnification, according to the competition.
