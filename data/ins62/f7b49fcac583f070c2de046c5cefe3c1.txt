Man Group, one of the largest listed hedge funds in the world, said it was 'a very difficult quarter for the asset management industry' as it reported a fall of almost $4 billion in assets under management to just over $138 billion.The FTSE 250 company also took a $4.5 billion hit from the stronger dollar in the third quarter and net outflows from its funds of £500 million. Its 'absolute return strategies' brought in $1.6 billion from a blend of investments designed to prosper during falling markets, rather than just out-running overall rises.
