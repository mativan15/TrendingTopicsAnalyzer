Upstream Bio emerged from stealth mode Thursday with $200 million to develop an experimental drug for severe asthma that it purchased from the Japanese drug maker Astellas. The money will fuel clinical trials of the drug and allow the Waltham company to purchase an additional clinical-stage drug candidate for other immune diseases, said Upstream chief executive Samantha Truex.The small biotech — with a workforce of about 15 people — was forged last year by a syndicate of life science venture capital firms that joined forces to bid on the Astellas drug when it was auctioned off.
