Stephen Reid (Todd Boyce) is once again making plans to get his hands on all of Audrey (Sue Nicholls)'s wealth in Coronation Street, but his plans are thwarted by Audrey herself.
Stephen is under pressure from two sides. Leo's dad Teddy (Grant Burgin) and Jenny (Sally Ann Matthews) are determined to find out what's happened to Leo. 
Despite an elaborate deception involving text messages from Leo's phone, Teddy is undeterred and tells Stephen he's planning to go to Canada – where Leo supposedly is although of course he's actually dead – to talk to him face to face.
