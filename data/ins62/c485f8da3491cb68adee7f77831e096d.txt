MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Tua Tagovailoa hit speedy wide receiver Tyreek Hill with two long completions during the Miami Dolphins' minicamp practice Thursday.And afterward, Tagovailoa hit back at critics.The third-year quarterback, aware that there are often questions — particularly on social media — about his arm strength and deep passing ability, went on the offensive about his abilities following the practice.'Yeah, if you saw the third-to-the-last play we had, I don't know if I could throw the ball downfield still, but by my account I think that might have been a touchdown to Tyreek,' Tagovailoa said.
