The Delhi High Court on Friday granted eight-week interim bail to businessman Gautam Thapar Avantha Group, the promoter in a money laundering case. Thapar has preferred an application for interim bail on the grounds of medical issues in order to enable him to seek treatment. The bench of Justice Jasmeet Singh on Friday after hearing arguments advanced by both sides granted the interim bail for eight weeks to Thapar on furnishing two surety bonds of Rs 50,000 each with other conditions. Counsel for Directorate of Enforcement, Advocate Rajat Nair opposed the bail application.
