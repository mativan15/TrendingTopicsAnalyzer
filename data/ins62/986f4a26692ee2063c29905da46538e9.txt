Paul Mathieson's new exhibition began with walks around Uptown Saint John.

In a pre-pandemic world, he sketched, took photos and jotted notes of inspiration. Then, like everyone else, the British-born artist found himself restricted to the visual parameters of his home.

"Once you're in your room and you're locked down, so to speak, you've got to find other sources [of inspiration] to introduce to what you're doing," he said.
