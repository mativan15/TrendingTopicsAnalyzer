"A rising dollar or a falling rupee coupled with rising interest rates may not really bode well for certain sectors from an earnings standpoint and from an equity market point of view as well," says Lakshmi Iyer, CEO, Investment Advisory Business, Asset Management Company. 
What is happening in the money market both in terms of yields as well as currency?Clearly the rupee is under pressure right now, though there may be some intermittent relief. A depreciating rupee starts impinging on imports – whether it is our crude oil requirement or gold requirement or anything else.
