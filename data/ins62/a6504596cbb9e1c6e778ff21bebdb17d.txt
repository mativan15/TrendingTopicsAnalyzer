ACCOUNTS published on Companies House confirm Weymouth Football Club lost a huge six-figure sum in a single year of trading.

Up to May 31 this year, the Terras lost £291,112 leading to their much-publicised financial strife.

At August's fans' forum, acting financial director Simon Etherington revealed £112,000 of debt had built up during the club's time in the National League.

It is understood much of the deficit had been caused by security costs, a change of first-team manager, the cancellation of last year's Boxing Day fixture and a paucity of home games in March.
