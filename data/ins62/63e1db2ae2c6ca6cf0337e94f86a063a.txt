Activity in India's services sector rose to an 11-year high in May as new business picked up and demand recovered following the reopening of the economy after Covid-19 lockdowns, a private survey showed on Friday, even as input prices recorded an unprecedented rise. The S&P Global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for services rose to the highest level since April 2011 to 58.9 in May from 57.9 in April with consumer services recording the sharpest increase in new orders.

A reading above 50 shows expansion and one below that indicates contraction in activity.
