The UK's new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has insisted that Prime Minister Liz Truss is still running the government after reports suggested he was preparing to scrap further parts of her 'mini' Budget.Following Truss's decision to sack her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng on Friday, senior Conservative MPs believe it is a matter of time before she is replaced as prime minister. Kwarteng has privately told friends he believes Truss will last in her post only a week. When asked who was leading the government, Hunt told the BBC on Sunday that 'the prime minister's in charge', adding that Truss could be trusted because 'she's changed, she's been willing to do that most difficult thing in politics, which is to change tack'.
