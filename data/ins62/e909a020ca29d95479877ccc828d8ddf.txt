LONDON (Reuters) - Sentiment among British businesses edged higher in May, except for consumer-facing companies that are most exposed to the growing cost-of-living crunch, a survey showed on Tuesday.

The Lloyds Bank Business Barometer rose in May to 38% from 33% in April, its first increase since February, despite worries about a slowing economy.

Other surveys - like the closely-watched S&P Global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) gauge of business activity - have pointed to a sharp slowdown in the economy in May.
