Filipino American small business owner Mar Velicaria sat down with NextShark to talk about what their identity and online platform mean to them.

In February, Velicaria went viral on TikTok for their minimalist and modern Philippine accessories, garnering more than 1 million views on their most popular TikTok video.

Marharlika, Velicaria's small business, is a brand that Velicaria created after noticing the lack of minimalist jewelry that proudly presented their heritage. The accessories incorporate aspects of Filipino heritage and culture in its designs with a focus on the Philippines Sun.
