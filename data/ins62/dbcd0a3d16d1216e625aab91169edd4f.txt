The New York Yankees were able to take care of the Cleveland Guardians in a pretty matter-of-fact Game 5 victory, but the fact that the Bronx Bombers had to go the distance with the pesky Guardians means they're not ideally set up to take on the Houston Astros. 
The Yanks were already going to be a sizable underdog against Houston, but with the way the pitching matchups shake out, they're now sitting at +170 (37% implied probability) to win the series.
As for Game 1, the Pinstripes will turn to Jameson Taillon to take on Justin Verlander.
