Paul Merson believes Newcastle have every chance of beating Manchester United on Sunday if they simply carry on as they have been.

The Magpies have enjoyed a resurgence under Eddie Howe since the manager took over. At first, he rued his side's mentality at shipping costly goals and not being able to hold onto leads.

However, he has built impressively and led Newcastle to just a single defeat in nine Premier League games.

And that run has included a thrilling 3-3 draw with Manchester City and 4-1 and 5-1 victories in their past two games against Fulham and Brentford.
