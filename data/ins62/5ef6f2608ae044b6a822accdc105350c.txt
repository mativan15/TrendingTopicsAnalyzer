I have been doing presentations in this community for a long time on domestic violence.

I have shared educational materials and raised awareness in churches, places of business, medical facilities, schoolsand helping organizations.

Community members often have questions about why victims don't leave or how to stop perpetrators. I try to respond thoughtfully without victim blaming and reinforcing myths.

People rarely ask, 'Who are survivors?'

I work at the Family Peace Center, where we serve all survivors, and I think an answer to this question has value.
