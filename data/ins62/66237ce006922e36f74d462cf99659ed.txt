Both Ben Wallace and Jeremy Hunt have seen as potential replacement for the embattled Ms Truss. 
But Mr Wallace has said he wants to remain as Defence Secretary and pleaded with Tory colleagues to "stop playing political parlour games".
Meanwhile Mr Hunt said  he denied he had ambitions for the top job, saying he, his wife and his children have ruled it out.
Mr Wallace told The Times: "The public wants stability and security and if the Government fails to deliver that then they will send us into opposition.
