Stock buying by corporate insiders has risen sharply in May, but retail investors may want to hold out a little longer before following their lead. Through May 23, the ratio of insider buy to sell value was at its highest monthly level since March 2020, according to data from The Washington Service. The number of inside buyers had already topped 1,200, making it the biggest month of the year so far, and was on track to outnumber sellers for the first time in more than two years. The buyers include CEOs at major companies, such as Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who bought $5.
