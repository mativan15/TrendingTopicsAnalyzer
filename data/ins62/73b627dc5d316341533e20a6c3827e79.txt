The Tigers have another crucial matchup coming up in this weekend's Magnolia Bowl against the Ole Miss Rebels, who rank as the No. 7 team in the country and are a perfect 7-0 on the season.
LSU didn't fare well in its first attempt at a top-10 team in Tennessee two weeks ago, but after opening as a one-point underdog against the Rebels, coach Brian Kelly's team is now a 1.5-point favorite against Mississippi, per BetMGM.
