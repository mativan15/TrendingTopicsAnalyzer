Indian government bond yields were higher for a fourth straight session on Friday, tracking a fierce upward trajectory in U.S. yields, while additional supply via the weekly debt auction further weighed on sentiment. The benchmark Indian 10-year government bond yield was at 7.5121% as of 0435 GMT. The yield had ended at 7.4767% on Thursday.
 It has risen by seven basis points in three sessions. New Delhi is scheduled to raise 280 billion Indian rupees ($3.38 billion) through sale of bonds later in the day, which includes 120 billion rupees of the benchmark 2032 paper.
