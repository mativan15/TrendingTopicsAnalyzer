Caroline Manzo could make a big return to "The Real Housewives of New Jersey," but under a couple conditions.

In a panel at BravoCon 2022 on Saturday, Oct. 15, the 61-year-old told fans that she is "completely open" to re-joining the show on the grounds that her former co-star Teresa Giudice admits that she lied about what she said about her.

In May, Manzo spoke on her son Albie Manzo's podcast "Dear Albie," detailing how Giudice claimed that she reported the 50-year-old to the IRS, which ended up sending Giudice and her ex-husband to prison for fraud after a federal case.
