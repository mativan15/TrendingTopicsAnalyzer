China is recruiting dozens of former British military pilots to help train its armed forces, with the Defence Intelligence service set to issue a "threat alert".

About 30 retired pilots are believed to have been lured to train members of China's People's Liberation Army, taking advantage of lucrative recruitment packages. Some of the packages being offered to ex-pilots are thought to be as much as £237,911, according to reports.
