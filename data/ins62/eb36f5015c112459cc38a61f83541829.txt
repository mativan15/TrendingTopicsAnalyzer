Britain's Got Talent returns for its grand finale tonight, with act Flintz and T4ylor among those hoping to walk away as 2022 champions.
In recent weeks, ITV viewers have watched contestants try and impress Amanda Holden, Simon Cowell, David Walliams and Alesha Dixon enough to make it through each tough stage. 
They've been hooked as the competition has gradually whittled down, with Sunday night marking the final of this year's contest. 
Forty acts went head-to-head in the semi-finals and 10 made it through for the chance to take away the £250,000 grand prize and a coveted spot at the Royal Variety Performance.
