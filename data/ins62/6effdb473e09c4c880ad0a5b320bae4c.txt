'We've had to make the difficult decision to move forward with a reorganization of the sales-led side of our company, which included saying goodbye to 23 team members. Every person we said goodbye to was a talented contributor and a valued teammate,' Thomas said in a statement to SFGATE. 'We are a growth company and we believe in our vision as strongly as ever.'

This round of layoffs follows layoffs in June, when 34 employees were laid off. (It's worth noting the similarities between Thomas' statement to SFGATE and the one Computerworld received back in June when the publication reported on its initial 2022 layoffs.
