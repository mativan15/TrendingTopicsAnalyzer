Shares of Salesforce Inc. popped 6% in premarket trading Tuesday after CNBC reported that activist investor Starboard Value LP had taken a 'significant' stake in the software company. The report noted that Starboard founder Jeff Smith shared with CNBC that he saw 'significant opportunity' in the shares, which have lost more than 40% of their value so far in 2022. Smith told CNBC that Salesforce's CRM, +3.49% 'sub-par mix of growth and profitability' is driving a valuation discount for the stock. Starboard didn't immediately respond to a MarketWatch request for confirmation of the stake, nor did a Salesforce representative.
