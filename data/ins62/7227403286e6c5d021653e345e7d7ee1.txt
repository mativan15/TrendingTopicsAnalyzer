MEXICO CITY, June 1 (Reuters) - Mexican leasing firm Unifin has reached an agreement with Credit Suisse for a credit line worth $500 million, the company said.

The funds will be used for corporate purposes, including debt refinancing, Unifin said in a statement.

Unifin also said that it had successfully concluded an agreement with holders of a $200 million international bond to extend its maturity to May 2024 from August of this year.

The company's stock has been one of the hardest hit in the market this year, falling 54% amid the same unfavorable conditions facing other non-bank financiers such as Credito Real and AlphaCredit.
