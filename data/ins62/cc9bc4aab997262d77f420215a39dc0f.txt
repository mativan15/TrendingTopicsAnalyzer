British music fans have expressed dismay after Glastonbury announced that the cost of tickets for next year's event would rise from £265 to £335 (plus booking fee).Emily Eavis, co-organiser of the not-for-profit festival, said: 'We have tried very hard to minimise the increase in price on the ticket but we're facing enormous rises in the costs of running this vast show, whilst still recovering from the huge financial impact of two years without a festival because of Covid.'It is likely that Glastonbury is the canary in the coalmine, as many festival organisers grapple with increasing financial challenges.
