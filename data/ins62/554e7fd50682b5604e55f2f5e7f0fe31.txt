Shares of Conn's Inc. CONN, +5.19% plummeted 18.6% in premarket trading toward a more than two-year low, after the home goods retailer warned of a revenue shortfall and said its chief executive officer stepped down after just 14 months in the role. "Conn's remains challenged by macroeconomic headwinds, which is impacting consumer spending and disproportionately affecting year-over-year sales to the company's financial access customer segment and sales of discretionary product categories," the company said in a statement.
