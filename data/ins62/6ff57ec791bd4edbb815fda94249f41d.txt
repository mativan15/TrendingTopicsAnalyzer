Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the Kremlin has used its control of the news media to justify its war as defensive, a necessary response to Western efforts to destroy Russia. Recently, when Putin announced that he was mobilizing Russian reservists, he again accused the West of trying to weaken and undermine Russia.

Some analysts have claimed that Russians support the war in large part because they believe state propaganda like this about a hostile West.
