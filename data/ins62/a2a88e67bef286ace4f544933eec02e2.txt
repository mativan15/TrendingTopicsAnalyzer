(Bloomberg) -- An ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker sued the investment bank for around £20.3 million ($22.9 million) to make up for him losing his job after he made whistleblowing allegations about regulatory failures.Thomas Doyle, who was the bank's head of synthetic swap sales from 2018 to 2021, said Goldman claimed it fired him for 'causing disruption and conflict,' at the start of a London employment tribunal on Tuesday. He alleges that it was in fact because he made multiple whistleblowing claims and the reasons for his firing were a sham.
