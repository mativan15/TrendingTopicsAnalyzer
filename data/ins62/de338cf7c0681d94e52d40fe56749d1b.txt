After just 45 days in office Liz Truss has resigned, making her the shortest serving prime minister in British history.And what an eventful six weeks it was.In that time, she managed to announce 45 billion pounds (A$80 billion) worth of unfunded tax cuts, sack her Chancellor when she realised her policies had spooked the financial markets, then reverse the majority of the measures announced in her mini-budget to try to appease the markets and save her political skin.Her signature policies had been obliterated, "Trussonomics" was dead, and the prime minister's grip on power was heading the same way.
