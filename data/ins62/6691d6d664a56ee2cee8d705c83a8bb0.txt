HONG KONG (Reuters) - Three members of a Hong Kong pro-democracy student group were sentenced on Saturday to up to three years jail for conspiracy to incite subversion, after setting up street booths that allegedly called on people to oppose the government.

The three, plus one ordered to go to a less-severe correction facility, had pleaded guilty to various acts between October 2020 and June 2021, including giving speeches asking members of the public to struggle against those in power, that were deemed to violate a China-imposed national security law.
