NEW DELHI: Following the impact of the government's fiscal measures, which included tariff changes for many commodities, the domestic market started last week on a negative note. Towards the end of the week, the market was able to recoup its losses following favourable retail earnings in the US and reduced FII selling. Analysts said that though these measures by the government and RBI will help control inflation in the long-term, it will have a cascading effect on the market and economy in the short to medium-term.
