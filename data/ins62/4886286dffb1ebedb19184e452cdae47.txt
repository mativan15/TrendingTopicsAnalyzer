As the International Monetary Fund praised India's Direct Benefit Transfer scheme as a logistical marvel, a war of words began between the BJP and the Congress after Congress leader P Chidambaram tweeted that both Aadhaar and DBT was launched by the UPA government. Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri slammed the claim and said this way the Congress will one day claim credit for Covid vaccines, Kartavya Path and the new Parliament building. Law minister Kiren Rijiju said Chidambaram's statement shows the "anti-poor mindset" of the Congress.
