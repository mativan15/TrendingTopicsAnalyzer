By Caitlin O'Kane June 1, 2022 / 4:38 PM / CBS News Minutes after a jury awarded Johnny Depp $15 million in damages and Amber Heard $2 million in their defamation lawsuit, Heard posted a statement on Instagram. The jury decided Heard was liable for defaming Depp in an op-ed published in the Washington Post. They also decided Depp was liable for a statement his attorney made calling Heard's claims of domestic violence a hoax. While it was a mixed verdict, Depp was awarded more money, and Heard said she felt "disappointment" in the outcome.
