"The world still needs to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions from 51 billion tons to zero, but global emissions continue to increase every year," Gates writes in his essay, which published as the Breakthrough Energy Summit kicks off in Seattle, Washington.

"If you follow the annual IPCC reports, you've watched as the scenarios for limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 or even 2 degrees Celsius become increasingly remote," Gates says, referencing the seminal Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports published by the United Nations which serve as a benchmark for global progress each year.
