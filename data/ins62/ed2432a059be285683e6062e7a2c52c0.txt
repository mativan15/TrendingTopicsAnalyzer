One of the three people charged in connection to the death of a 75-year-old 'rugby legend' in south Auckland has pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact. Ōtāhuhu man Peter Rasmussen​ was shot and killed in his home in August 2021, with police not arresting anyone in connection to his death until December. Chauntel Laurent appeared at the High Court at Auckland on Wednesday, where she admitted being an accessory after the fact to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, by helping them avoid arrest or conviction.
