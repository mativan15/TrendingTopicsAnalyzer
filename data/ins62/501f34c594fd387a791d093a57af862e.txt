May 29—OTTAWA — Asphalt contracting is not a business that has traditionally been considered a woman's role. But Michelle Harpe isn't letting that slow her down. She says a lot of people wonder why a woman is in this business.

"It does bother me, but it makes you just want to work that much harder to prove them wrong," she said.

Harpe is owner of TECSEAL, a locally owned and operated sealcoating, patchwork and line-striping business in Ottawa, Ohio, that also serves the Lima area. It is a woman-owned business.
