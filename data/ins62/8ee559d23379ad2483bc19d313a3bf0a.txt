Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is one of the most influential players in the web3, funding entrepreneurs in the space amid 'crypto winter.' Founded and helmed by general partner Chris Dixon, the venture firm's crypto arm raised a massive $4.5 billion fund in May for its fourth dedicated sector fund to continue backing early-stage founders just as the crypto downturn had begun to take root.
Now, it's doubling down on its programming for crypto founders, Dixon, an early Coinbase backer who has been investing at a16z since 2012, revealed on stage at Disrupt 2022 in San Francisco on Tuesday in an interview with TechCrunch's Lucas Matney.
