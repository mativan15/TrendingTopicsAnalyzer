Tyquan Thornton made his NFL season debut last week, and after reviewing the film, he was consistently beating coverage against the Lions. At first I thought, 'Eh, it's just the Lions, their secondary isn't that great.' It wasn't until Sunday's game that I started to change my mind when seeing him matched up against a much better pass defense than many give credit for.
Thornton scored twice with one coming on a jet sweep, and in limited runs, averaged 5.3 YPC, more than Rhamondre Stevenson in this game.
