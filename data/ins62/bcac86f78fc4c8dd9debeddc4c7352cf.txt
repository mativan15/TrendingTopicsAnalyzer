Hello neighbors.

As COVID-19 cases continue to decline in the Valley and we begin to again reach some semblance of normalcy, it is important to acknowledge the efforts of our healthcare workers.

Our hospitals and their staff members have logged countless hours during the COVID years to keep us healthy. The least we can do to thank them is address their needs through legislation.

That is why I'm an ardent supporter (and principal coauthor) of Assembly Bill 2404 by Asm. Luz Rivas of Arleta. Signed into law last month by Gov.
