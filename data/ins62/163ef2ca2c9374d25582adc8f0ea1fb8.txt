A Democratic member of Congress who still supports the 'Defund the Police' movement has spent nearly $500,000 in campaign funds on private security, according to a report Sunday.
Federal Election Commission records show that US Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), a former Black Lives Matter activist, shelled out more than $100,000 for 'security services' during the third quarter of 2022, Fox News said.
The spending pushed Bush's campaign outlays on private security during the 2020-22 election cycle to more than $490,000, according to the outlet.
