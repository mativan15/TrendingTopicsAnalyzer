October 19, 2022 09:27 AM Eastern Daylight Time ORLANDO, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Worldwide IT spending is projected to total $4.6 trillion in 2023, an increase of 5.1% from 2022, according to the latest forecast by Gartner, Inc. Demand for IT in 2023 is expected to be strong as enterprises push forward with digital business initiatives in response to economic turmoil.



'Enterprise IT spending is recession-proof as CEOs and CFOs, rather than cutting IT budgets, are increasing spending on digital business initiatives,' said John-David Lovelock, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner.
