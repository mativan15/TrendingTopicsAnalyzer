OPINION: It's grim to be in a fight with traders who think they can misrepresent goods, and then get you to accept something different, after you've paid. It's even worse when a trader barefacedly refuses to acknowledge there's a problem, and forces you to take legal action. I bought a secondhand iPhone 8 64GB phone from an established online trader this week, a black one. When I strolled over to pick it up from the business, I was told they didn't have the black one, but they did have a nice white one they had set aside specially for me.
