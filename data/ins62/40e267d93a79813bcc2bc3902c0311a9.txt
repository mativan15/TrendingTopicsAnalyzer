A national automotive parts and accessories retailer appears to be considering opening a local superstore.

A request for a pre-application meeting was submitted earlier this month in Sacramento County regarding the potential development of a new 33,000-square-foot AutoZone Super Store at the northwest corner of Date Avenue and Tyler Street in North Highlands.

A pre-application meeting allows a project applicant to meet with county representatives to review development proposals prior to the submittal of formal applications.
