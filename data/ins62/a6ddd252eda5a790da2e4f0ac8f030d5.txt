The Miami Dolphins have had four consecutive games where a quarterback was hurt, three straight where a different starter can't finish.

They've had multiple cornerbacks miss time — with cornerback Nik Needham's season coming to an end with a torn Achilles on Sunday, according to a league source — two starting tackles out and a bevy of other injuries.

And the Dolphins, with Sunday's 24-16 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, dropped their third in a row in the midst of all the health concerns.

But one thing coach Mike McDaniel doesn't want is to imply causation out of that correlation.
