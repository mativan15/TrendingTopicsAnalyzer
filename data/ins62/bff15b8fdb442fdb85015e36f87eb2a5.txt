Manchester United have been brutally ignored in the Premier League top-four conversation by former striker Dion Dublin, who has included a left-field shout in his early prediction. The Red Devils are outside contenders in the top-four race in Erik ten Hag's first season and are apparently out of Dublin's thinking altogether.Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur look best placed for a spot after the first 10 games after Chelsea and Liverpool endured sticky starts to the campaign. But the Blues have looked revitalised since Graham Potter replaced Thomas Tuchel, while Jurgen Klopp's side could be propelled by their win over Man City on Sunday.
