THE PRODUCTION of Russian helicopters is ongoing using the PHP1.9 billion downpayment deposited by the Philippines in January 2022, the Russian Embassy in Manila said.In an interview at his residence in Makati City on Wednesday, Russian Ambassador Marat Pavlov said the Philippines has yet to formally communicate its decision to terminate the PHP12.7 billion contract signed during the Duterte administration to purchase 16 Mi-17 helicopters, with an additional unit to be included at no extra cost.In June 2022, former Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana revealed he terminated the contract based on the decision of former President Rodrigo Duterte over the possible impact of several sanctions imposed on Russia due to the Ukraine war.
