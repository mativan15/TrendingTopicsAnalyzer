The Boston Celtics started off their 2022-23 campaign that honors the life and legacy of Hall of Fame big man Bill Russell as the man himself would have wanted it, with a 126-117 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday night. It happened at a TD Garden transformed by the players wearing the City Edition jerseys he helped design to pay homage to his historic career and works off of the court on a parquet literally bearing the imprint of his greatness.Looking much like the behemoth that came within two wins of an NBA title last season, the team had some issues controlling Sixers star Joel Embiid for much of the first half but had the game in hand by the final frame's start.
