East Africa is experiencing its worst drought in 40 years, and some scientists say everyone has a role to play in dealing with it. "These kinds of issues that are happening, for example, in the Horn of Africa are actually also impacting [others] at home, because that cup of coffee ... may have contributed to land degradation somewhere in the world, putting that country a little bit less resilient to drought," said Barron Joseph Orr, lead scientist of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).
