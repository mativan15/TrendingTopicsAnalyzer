The "Top Gun: Maverick" director showed a photoshopped picture of Miles Teller to Tom Cruise ahead of casting for the film. In an interview with Vulture's Bilge Ebiri, Joseph Kosinski discussed the "Top Gun" sequel and shared details on how he convinced Cruise, 59, to back the film. Kosinski told the outlet that he initially suggested Teller, 35, join the cast after working with him on the 2017 film, "Only the Brave." "I was actually in post on 'Only the Brave,' this was May 2017, so Miles Teller was on my mind," Kosinski told Vulture.
