There have been lots of great deals this week despite Memorial Day having come and gone, some of which are still available to Walmart Plus subscribers through the weekend. But if you're someone who cares more about smart home tech than the current highlights at Walmart, we've got an exclusive treat just for you.
Wellbots is offering Verge readers up to $80 off on select Google Nest devices until Sunday, June 19th.
