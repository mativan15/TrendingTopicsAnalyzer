Oracle Corp. is reportedly slowing its hiring, particularly in the Bay Area and Seattle, as it cuts jobs.

Hiring managers at the enterprise software giant have been asked to push back start dates for new recruits as hiring in general has been slashed, according to a report from Business Insider.

Some units that hiring for backfilled or critical positions have been told to avoid bringing on people in top talent areas where pay is high, like the Bay Area, Business Insider reported. They are being told to hire candidates in areas where they can pay lower salaries, including in Eastern Europe, the report said, citing company insiders and a recruiter.
