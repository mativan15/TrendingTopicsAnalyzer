The company had posted a total sales of 1,66,889 units in the same month last year, TVS Motor Company said in a statement. The year-on-year growth is not comparable due to the low base of sales in May 2021, because of the localised lockdown imposed by the Government of India during that period, the company noted. Total two-wheelers sales last month stood at 2,87,058 units, while the same was at 1,54,416 units in May 2021, it added.
