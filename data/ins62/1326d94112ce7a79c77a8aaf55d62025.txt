I'm a 40 year old male. I probably have ADHD. Been managing the family business for a while and it's given me nothing but depression. Any guidance?

I come from a front end web dev background but have recently found that I quite like solving problems. I really enjoy using spreadsheets although I'm a beginner. I have good IT skills. Running my dads packaging business has been really bad for my health. I need somewhere that I can be fairly creative, don't think I'll enjoy corporate. Fairly relaxed. Any ideas? Business analysis sounds like something I might enjoy but I don't know anything about it really. Don't have any real qualifications other than secondary school but have spent 15 years in IT.
