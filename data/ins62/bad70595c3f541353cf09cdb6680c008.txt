As a relief from harsh weather conditions caused by storms, Minnesota will likely have favourable weather from Tuesday. Several parts of Minnesota and some areas of South Dakota were put under a tornado watch till Monday evening. On Memorial Day, Minnesota had suffered around two rounds of storms. Earlier, the National Weather Service had put Monday under the "Particularly Dangerous Situation" category for Minnesota. It was for the first time in a decade that the weather department had issued an advisory for such a category in Minnesota.
