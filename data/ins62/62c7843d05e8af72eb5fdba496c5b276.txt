LSU opened as a slim home underdog against the undefeated Ole Miss Rebels, who rank as the No. 7 team in the country. The Tigers will hope to fare better in this one than they did in their first try against a top-10 team in Tennessee.
Vegas seems to be giving LSU a much better shot this time around. By Wednesday, the line had moved in the Tigers' favor, and they were favored by 1.5. Now, that line has moved slightly once more as coach Brian Kelly's team is now a two-point favorite, per the latest odds from BetMGM.
