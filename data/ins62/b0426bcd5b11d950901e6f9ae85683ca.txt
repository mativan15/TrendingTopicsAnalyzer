Toronto Raptors and Toronto Argonauts chaplain Herbie Kuhn does not pray for wins. Kuhn ministers to players in both the National Basketball Association and the Canadian Football League. He's also been the announcer for the Toronto Raptors since 1995. But he still doesn't ask God to let them win, even when the Raptors are contesting the NBA finals."Believe me, the sports fan in me certainly wants to win," Kuhn said. "What I do is I say, 'Lord, you've got children on both teams. You've given them everything they need to succeed.
