Holland America Line is offering a month-long sale with up to 50% off cruise fares and other perks, the cruise line told Travel + Leisure.

The company's "Celebration Sale" comes as the cruise line plans to have its full fleet back in service this month. To take advantage, travelers must book a cruise by June 30 and sail by Sept. 30, 2023.

"Having our full fleet of 11 ships back in service after more than two years on pause is cause for celebration, and the promotion is our way of thanking guests for their loyalty and choosing to cruise with Holland America Line," Beth Bodensteiner, the chief commercial officer of Holland America Line, said in a statement provided to T+L.
