Apex Legends developer Respawn Entertainment's commitment to diversity is a cornerstone of its character-driven narrative. The game boasts a massive roster of characters of all ages, races, and sexual identities. While Apex has had several story arcs focusing on lesbian, bisexual, and gay characters, the game has yet to introduce an openly transgender character to the game. Today, with the release of Stories From The Outlands: Last Hope, all of that changed.The trailer introduces us to Tressa (voiced by Meli Grant), a transwoman who appears to be a practicing witch.
