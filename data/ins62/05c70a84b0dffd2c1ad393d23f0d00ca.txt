bjdlzx (Note: This article was originally posted in the marketplace newsletter April 3, 2022 and has been updated as needed) There has been a whole lot of talk about how the hedging program is holding back progress at Laredo Petroleum (NYSE:LPI). The third quarter report has not gotten here yet and the comments have already begun. Therefore, I am digging out one of my "classic" replies to the situation. All one has to do is look at fiscal year 2020 when all the hedged companies followed the unhedged companies down despite the sizable hedging profits at the time.
