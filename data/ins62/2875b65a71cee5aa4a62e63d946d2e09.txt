Seething at his desk during Parliament's first session last week, Silvio Berlusconi clutched a note about his putative ally, Giorgia Meloni, the Brothers of Italy party leader.The 86-year-old former prime minister and media tycoon called Meloni 'opinionated, domineering, arrogant and offensive ... No willingness to change', according to a photograph of the note published in La Repubblica and authenticated by the Financial Times. 'She is someone you can't get along with,' the scribble read.Meloni, however, was unfazed: 'One point was missing from Berlusconi's list: that I cannot be blackmailed,' she said.
