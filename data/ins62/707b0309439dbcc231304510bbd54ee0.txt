As the cost of living crisis continues and energy bills are set to skyrocket again in a couple of months, any extra cash could be vital for families on low incomes. If a household qualified for the £150 council tax rebate, they might be entitled to extra cash from their local authority if they're struggling or claim certain benefits.Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced all households in bands A to D would receive a Council Tax rebate of £150 back in February. This help was said to affect 80 percent of British householders.
