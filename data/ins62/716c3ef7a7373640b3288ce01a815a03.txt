Dear Amy: I paid for a large portion of my favorite nephew's college expenses (he's also my godson). I was happy to do this because I love him and want to support him.

His mother (my sister) told me that he has asked to have only immediate family at his graduation ceremony and dinner this coming spring, which means I would not be included.

I know that he has a right to choose whom he wants to invite to his graduation, but can I at least tell him how hurt I am by this? Can I ask that I be included (and that I will leave my husband and daughter at home)?

I do feel somewhat "entitled" to be there to help celebrate a college degree he was able to receive debt-free in large part because of my generosity.
