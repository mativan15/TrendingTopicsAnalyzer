Porn sites are not doing enough to protect children, Ofcom has warned, with few bothering to do more than ask for visitors to self-declare that they are over 18.Among the 19 video-sharing sites that the regulator has oversight of, OnlyFans is the only adult-focused site to have responded to regulation by adopting age verification for viewers, using a series of tools to keep children from signing up.The concerns accompany a report into the regulator's first year in charge of video-sharing platforms.
