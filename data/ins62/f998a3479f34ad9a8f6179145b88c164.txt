An anonymous reader quotes a report from Bloomberg: Sweden's incoming government will ask state-run utility Vattenfall AB to add nuclear power stations as the economy becomes increasingly electrified. "New reactors will be built in Sweden," Ebba Busch, whose Christian Democrat party belongs to an alliance that won the most seats in last month's general election, said at a news conference Friday. The right-wing bloc is slated to become the Nordic nation's government in a parliamentary vote next week.
