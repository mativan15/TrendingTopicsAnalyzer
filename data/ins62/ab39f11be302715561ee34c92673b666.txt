(Bloomberg) -- Sweden's new prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, chose lawmaker and former labor market minister Elisabeth Svantesson to oversee the biggest Nordic economy on the cusp of a recession.Svantesson, 54, will be finance minister in the center-right minority coalition led by the Moderates, Kristersson said on Tuesday. The nationalist Sweden Democrats, who emerged as the biggest winners in last month's election, won't have seats in the new cabinet, but will back the three-party government in exchange for having their policies on crime and immigration enacted.
