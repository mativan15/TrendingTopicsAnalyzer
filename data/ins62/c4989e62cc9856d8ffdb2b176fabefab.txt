• Organised crime is, regrettably, in Sicily's DNA but most visitors to the island will never be aware of it. It's the locals – and especially local businesses – who suffer most, and protection rackets are a harsh reality. AddioPizzo (farewell to protection payments, ) is a civil society groups grouping businesses, organisations and individuals who refuse to hand over money to the Mafia. There's a handy map of participating companies on the website.
• Drivers are required to keep a reflective yellow/orange bib inside the car, to be worn if they break down or have an accident and need to get out of the car (they come as standard with hire cars).
