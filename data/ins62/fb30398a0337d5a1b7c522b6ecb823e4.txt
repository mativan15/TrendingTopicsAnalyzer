The 390ft superyacht has been anchored in the United Arab Emirates for weeks.

The vessel belongs to Russian oligarch Andrey Melnichenko, worth an estimated $23 billion.

Italian authorities seized his $600 million superyacht in March amid western sanctions.

A superyacht belonging to a sanctioned Russian oligarch has been spotted in the port of Ras al-Khaimah, in the United Arab Emirates, according to AP journalists who saw the vessel on Tuesday.
