It was nearly 30 years ago that Berlusconi brought his partners' once small, marginalized parties into one of his governments and Italy's political mainstream. But today it is Meloni, the leader of the Brothers of Italy, a party descended from the wreckage of Italy's experiment with fascism last century, who is almost certain to be the next prime minister when a government is formed, perhaps as soon as this week.The question now, though, is whether the aging center-right leader can fulfill his promise to act as a moderating, pro-European force on Italy's next government, or whether he has lost control of the politics he set in motion that have made Italy, the birthplace of fascism, once again a testing ground for the far right's advance in Europe.
