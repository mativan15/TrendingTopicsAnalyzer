On a chilly Monday in May, MIT's Killian Court was transformed into a festival of fun. Over 1,200 members of the community enjoyed hot dogs, fried dough, and bouncy castles before cozying up on picnic blankets to watch the main event. First-year students took to the stage to perform skits — or 'PLAYsentations' — demonstrating the toys they created this semester in mechanical engineering class 2.00b (Toy Product Design). For the 150 students in the class, presenting in front of a large audience and in such an iconic location so early in their time at MIT was a surreal experience.
