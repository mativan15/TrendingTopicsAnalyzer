(Patch)Hi there, Bedford! I'm here in your inbox today to tell you everything you need to know about what's going on around town. Enjoy... First, today's weather: Very warm and more humid. High: 89 Low: 68. These are the great local businesses that sponsor the Bedford Daily. We love what they do, and we think you will, too: Attention Bedford pet owners! Did you know that Bedford has a new pet store with a great selection of high-quality pet foods and supplies, a full service grooming salon, a self-serve pet wash, pet boarding and even a doggie bakery!?! Friendly Pets on Colby Ct.
