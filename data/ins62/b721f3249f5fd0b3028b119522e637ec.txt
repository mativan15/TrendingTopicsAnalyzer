Being a landlord is one of the oldest ways to earn an income stream. And these days, you don't have to buy a house to get a piece of the action.

REITs collect rent from their properties and pass it along to shareholders in the form of dividends. That means investors don't have to worry about screening tenants, fixing damages or chasing down late payments.
