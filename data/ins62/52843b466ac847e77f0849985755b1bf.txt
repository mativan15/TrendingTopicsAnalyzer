Instagram has announced safety feature updates it says will help public figures better protect themselves from abuse.
The move comes just days after another Premier League footballer revealed he had been racially abused on the platform.
Brentford striker Ivan Toney took to Twitter on Saturday to reveal he had been sent racist abuse on Instagram after scoring twice in a match against Brighton last Friday night – in what was the latest in a string of incidents where footballers and other sportspeople have been targeted online.
