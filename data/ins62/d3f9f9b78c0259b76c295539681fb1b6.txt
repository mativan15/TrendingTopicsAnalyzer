Melbourne's west is shaping up as one of the key battlegrounds of the state election.After two years of lockdowns, a population boom in the area, a cost-of-living crisis and a rise in independents, it's an area where Labor, the Coalition and independents will be hopeful of picking up seats.Many residents said they have felt neglected by the major parties for decades. There is also growing frustration with a lack of suitable transport and health infrastructure.That crunch is likely to be felt in places like Melton, about 35 kilometres from the CBD.
