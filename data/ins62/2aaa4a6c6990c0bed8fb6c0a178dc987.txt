"My ex in-laws have a very nice condo but not extravagant. After a few visits, I noticed a door that seemed out of place. Given the rooms around it, it was much larger than a typical closet. I finally asked. It was a climate and humidity controlled wine cellar. Easily 200 bottles that cost at least $40 minimum each. There was also a small humidor for their Cuban cigars under a poster for Scarface. It was awesome. Wealthy people have extravagant things that most don't even notice."
