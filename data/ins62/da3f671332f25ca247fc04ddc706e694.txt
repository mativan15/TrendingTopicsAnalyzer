Married At First Sight UK expert Charlene Douglas has defended the decision to allow Matt Murray and Whitney Hughes back into the experiment after widespread criticism, while also applauding the couple's bravery.
The E4 dating show shocked viewers earlier this month when the pair were granted permission to return as a new dating couple after their marriages to their original partners, Gemma Rose and Duka Cav, didn't work out.
Charlene, along with fellow experts Paul C Brunson and Mel Schilling, welcomed Matt and Whitney back into the throws, asking them to be ‘respectful of the other couples, their feelings, and their emotions'.
