Three dads will embark Friday on a 3,000-mile trek across America. They're on a very important mission: to cure a rare genetic disorder affecting their children. Peter Halliburton, Brett Stelmaszek and Kevin Frye will live-stream their journey from New York, N.Y. to Los Angeles, Calif. inside a decked out Tesla Model-X to raise awareness and money for The SynGAP Research Fund (SRF), a charity dedicated to funding the research and development of treatments, therapies and support systems for SYNGAP1 patients.
