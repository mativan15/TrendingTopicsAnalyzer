Amazon reveals date it will break old Kindles (Image: AMAZON GETTY)Amazon will block millions of Kindle owners from accessing the Kindle Store directly from their ereaders on August 17, 2022. Starting from that date, Kindle owners will need to buy books to read on their Kindle from a different device, like a smartphone or tablet. To continue purchasing new ebooks from the Kindle itself, owners will need to upgrade to a newer model.The second-generation Kindle released in 2009 and the fifth generation ereader, launched back in 2012, are two popular models that will be impacted by the impending block.
