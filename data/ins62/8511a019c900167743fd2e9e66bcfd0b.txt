Mason Mount says Chelsea showed they can deliver manager Graham Potter's demand to 'suffer' in games as they ground out a win at Aston Villa.The Blues faced 18 shots at Villa Park but two goals from Mount gave them a fourth win in a row in all competitions and four-straight clean sheets."We know we can do better, but we stuck it out, dug in and got the win," said Mount. "The gaffer says a lot we have got to suffer in games sometimes. We did that.'We know as players in the game we're not going to have the ball for the whole game.
