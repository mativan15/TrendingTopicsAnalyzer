The future is now as two of tennis' young guns will contest the 2022 French Open women's final as it is Iga Swiatek vs Coco Gauff in Saturday's showpiece match on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

Will Iga Swiatek hold aloft the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen for a second time – just a few days after turning 21 –when 'game, set and match' is called or will 18-year-old Gauff win her maiden Grand Slam title?

Both are seen as the future of women's tennis with Gauff breaking through in 2019 when she became the youngest player to reach the main draw at Wimbledon at the age of 15 years and three months.
