Although we are at the unofficial midpoint of the college football season, many outlets have come out with their midseason All-American teams, award winners and front-runner for the four College Football Playoff spots.

Pro Football Focus released their midseason awards and even though I don't agree with some of them (Alabama's Bryce Young being the Heisman front runner), there is one we completely agree on, their midseason John Mackey Award winner, Notre Dame tight end Michael Mayer.

The junior has been phenomenal this season, he's been the best player on the Irish's team this season.
