The Biden administration has stopped paying to mail out free Covid-19 tests and expects to end free vaccines for Americans after Congress dropped billions of dollars for such efforts from a government funding bill last month. People familiar with the matter said the administration's Covid-19 task force will remain in place ahead of an expected uptick in cases in the coming winter months. But the team will shift focus from emergency response to longer-term issues, such as boosting domestic manufacturing of personal protective equipment, researching long Covid and supporting genomic sequencing to identify variants, the people said.
