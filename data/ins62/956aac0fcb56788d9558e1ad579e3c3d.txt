As he enters his fifth series as New South Wales coach, one thing about Brad Fittler's Origin tenure remains true – his Blues machine runs on vibes. It's always been that way for Fittler. One of his greatest strengths as a coach is his absolute belief in what he's doing and his willingness to roll the dice on selections, to take a big swing. Brad Fittler is going to select the players Brad Fittler thinks the Blues need, for better or for worse, and he'll live with the consequences.It's why Fittler blooded a record 11 debutants in his first game in charge back in 2018 and it's why he has the equal-best win percentage of any New South Wales coach.
