Konami has announced a Silent Hill Transmission that promises 'the latest updates' for the series - and you can watch it with us here on IGN.

We don't know what's coming in the showcase, but the announcement tweet reads: "In your restless dreams, do you see that town? The latest updates for the SILENT HILL series, will be revealed during the #SILENTHILL Transmission.' That hopefully means we'll be seeing at least one new game announced for the franchise.

How to Watch the Silent Hill Transmission Stream

The Silent Hill Transmission will begin tomorrow, October 19 at 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern / 10pm UK (that's October 20 at 8am AEDT).
