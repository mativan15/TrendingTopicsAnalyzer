GlaxoSmithKline is extending its pipeline of next-generation vaccines with the $3.3 billion acquisition of Affinivax, a US clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, in its biggest buy-up in the sector for almost a decade.The acquisition of the privately held company based in Boston, Massachusetts, is the largest vaccines deal for GSK since 2014 and signals a big investment as the FTSE 100 drugmaker prepares to demerge its consumer goods unit into a separate listed company, called Haleon.The deal will give the demerged pharmaceuticals business, called New GSK, access to a new class of treatments developed to target common diseases including pneumonia, meningitis, bloodstream infections and milder diseases such as sinusitis and swimmer's ear, also known as otitis.
