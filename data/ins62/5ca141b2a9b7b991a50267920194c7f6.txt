Daytona Beach, Fla., Oct. 21, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Following the acquisition of Connected Living, Sentrics, which now owns and markets three engagement platforms, shared its vision for a single, integrated solution that provides a consistent and personalized engagement experience across all acuity levels while customizing the experience for each care level. Leveraging the foundation of the resident TV, the platform will offer each care level—hospital, skilled nursing, independent and assisted living and memory care—a different yet familiar way to connect with the community, friends and family, and the entire healthcare ecosystem.
