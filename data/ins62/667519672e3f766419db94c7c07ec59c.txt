Brendan Fraser is delivering an apology 25 years in the making.

During a red carpet interview with SFGate at the screening for "The Whale" in San Francisco, the actor addressed a situation that happened in the city over two decades ago while filming "George of the Jungle."

Fraser recalled being on set in San Francisco for the 1997 film, which followed the love story of George, who was raised by an ape in the jungle after a plane crash, and Ursula Stanhope (played by Leslie Mann), an heiress from San Francisco.
