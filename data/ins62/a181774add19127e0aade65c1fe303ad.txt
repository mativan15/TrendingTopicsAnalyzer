When the Sooners were sent off to Gainesville, a matchup against the hosting Gators was all but a given if a trip to Omaha was the goal.

The Gator-friendly crowd didn't matter. The Sooners lived by the long ball and took down the No. 14 Gators 9-4. The Sooners are now one win away from Super Regionals and three wins away from the program's first College World Series berth since 2010.

Since OU hasn't lost a game in Regionals yet, whoever they play in the final will have to beat them twice. After a well-earned day off on Sunday, Oklahoma will play the winner of Central Michigan and Florida on Monday.
