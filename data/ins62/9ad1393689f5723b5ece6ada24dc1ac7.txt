Over the past two weeks, Ye — the artist and and entrepreneur formally known as Kanye West — has worn a 'White Lives Matter' T-shirt, spread antisemitic conspiracy theories on a popular Revolt podcast and falsely blamed George Floyd's death on fentanyl. That could cost him some fashion and branding deals – Adidas has said its partnership with the rapper is 'under review.' So far, though, in the United States his music remains just as popular as it was on audio and video streaming services, although on terrestrial radio his daily spins and average daily audience were down about 21% since Meta and Twitter restricted his social accounts, according to Luminate.
