In 2003, the City of Edmonton launched a pilot project to recycle street sand, a program that would go on to win awards and was believed to be the biggest of its kind in North America.Nineteen years later, the city no longer recycles the thousands of tonnes of sand it uses each year to improve winter-driving traction, though other Alberta cities are saving money by recycling sand.Edmonton cancelled its sand recycling program after a city audit found it was not properly managed and may not have led to cost savings, but recycling advocates — including the program's architect — say the program is worth pursuing and should never have been thrown out.
