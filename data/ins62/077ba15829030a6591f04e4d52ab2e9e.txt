The Rutgers Scarlet Knights play the Indiana Hoosiers on Saturday, and if you're wondering how you can watch the action live, you've come to the right place.
This Week 8 matchup is a game between two programs moving in the wrong direction. It is must-win for both teams if they have any hopes of making the postseason, and both teams are trying to snap active losing streaks. To make matters worse, Indiana has lost seven straight Big Ten road games dating back to December 2020, and Rutgers has lost 21 straight conference games at home.
