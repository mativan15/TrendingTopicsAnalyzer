SAN DIEGO – Bryce Harper hit another postseason home run – no surprise there – and then Kyle Schwarber topped him by launching a shot that amazed even his teammates.Harper hit his fourth homer this postseason and Schwarber hit a jaw-dropping, 488-foot drive that carried the Philadelphia Phillies over the San Diego Padres 2-0 Tuesday night to open the all-wild card NL Championship Series.Zack Wheeler was awesome, too, combining with two relievers on a one-hitter for Philadelphia. The Phillies managed just three hits off Yu Darvish and the San Diego bullpen – the combined four hits matched the fewest ever in a postseason game.
