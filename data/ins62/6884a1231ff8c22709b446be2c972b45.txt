Oct. 16—MANISTEE — A crowd gathered in the rain to witness a dedication ceremony for a public art installation, the Origins Walk at the mouth of the Manistee River channel.

The city hopes to shine a light on the full scope of its history, from the roots of the Anishinaabek of the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, to the arrival of Europeans, and present-day.

Twenty silhouettes, purposefully faced in the western direction, highlight a noted resident's life for their historical and cultural impact on Manistee; three of which are dedicated to Anishinaabek water protectors, leaders and elders.
