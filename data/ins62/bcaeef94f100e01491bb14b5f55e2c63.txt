NHK has learned that Kagoshima Prefecture plans to hold evacuation drills for its remote islands in preparation for a possible armed attack. The move is in response to China's growing assertiveness in the East and South China Seas. The practice, set for January, will be the first of its kind in the southwestern prefecture. Residents will be brought to the mainland. The Japanese government is boosting deployment of Japan Self-Defense Forces units to remote islands of the prefecture and of Okinawa Prefecture, also in southwestern Japan.
