Houston largely has kept the Yankees from hitting home runs, allowing only a pair of solo shots. The Astros arrive in New York with a 2-0 AL Championship Series lead going into Game 3 on Saturday, halfway toward their third ALCS win over the Yankees in six seasons. "We got to shorten up a little bit and try to put the ball in play," Giancarlo Stanton said after a 3-2 loss on Thursday night.
