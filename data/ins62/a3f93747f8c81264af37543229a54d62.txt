On Monday, the Tennessee Titans and mayor John Cooper announced that the two sides have reached a deal on a new stadium.

The new venue, which will feature a translucent but non-retractable dome and PSLs (personal seat licenses), will be located to the east of Nissan Stadium and will cost $2.1 billion.

The expected capacity will be somewhere between 55,000 to 60,000, which is actually a 10-percent decrease from Nissan Stadium's. Also, the playing surface will be artificial grass.

'When my father brought this team to Tennessee 25 years ago, I don't think he could have imagined a better home for our organization,' said Titans controlling owner Amy Adams Strunk, per Jim Wyatt of Titans Online.
