American grandmaster Hans Niemann filed a lawsuit Thursday against five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen and online platform Chess.com – the latest twist in the cheating saga that has shaken the world of competitive chess.

The lawsuit, filed in a U.S. District Court in Missouri, comes a little more than six weeks after Niemann's surprising defeat of Carlsen at the Sinquefield Cup in St. Louis, which prompted Carlsen to abruptly withdraw from the event without explanation. Carlsen formally accused Niemann of cheating in a statement three weeks later.
