Actor Ishaan Khatter says playing a real-life war hero in the upcoming movie Pippa so early on in his career was a transforming experience. Billed as a heroic tank battle, the film underscores the bravery of Brigadier Balram Singh Mehta (Ishaan), a veteran of the 45th Cavalry tank squadron, who, along with his siblings, fought on the eastern front during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971. Ishaan, known for Beyond the Clouds and Dhadak, said he is elated to play an Indian Army officer who was his age at that point of time.
