Paddy Pimblett has clapped back at T.J. Dillashaw after the former UFC champion questioned his eating habits and work ethic.

Dillashaw was critical of Pimblett's tendency to balloon up in between fights, stating that the rising star will never become champion if he doesn't change his ways.

Pimblett (18-3 MMA, 2-0 UFC) didn't take well to Dillashaw's comments, reminding him of his failed drug test for EPO, for which he had to serve a two-year suspension.
