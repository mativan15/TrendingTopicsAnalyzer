Luakam Anambe, of Brazil's Anambé indigenous group, is at the helm of a small, burgeoning business selling handmade Indigenous dolls in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Part of the money she makes from her dolls goes toward a social project to help women in need. Silvia Izquierdo/AP Dolls bearing faces and body paints of different Indigenous groups are displayed at a sewing workshop in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Each one is handsewn, dressed in clothes created by Luakam Anambe, of Brazil's Anambe Indigenous group, and carefully painted by her daughter Atyna Porã.
