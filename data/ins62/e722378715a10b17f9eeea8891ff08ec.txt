May 28—When 125 low-income Stockton, Calif. residents were given $500 a month, no strings attached, they ended the two-year program with more full-time employment, more food security and less depression, anxiety and fatigue.

The Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration project, started in 2019 by former Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs, was the first mayor-led guaranteed income project in the country.

Boulder is hopeful that the guaranteed income pilot program it's currently embarking on will prove just as successful in reducing poverty, increasing housing and food security, improving mental health and more.
