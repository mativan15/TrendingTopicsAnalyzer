More than two-thirds of parents have turned to voice assistants such as Amazon's Alexa or Google Home because their child's homework is becoming more difficult, according to a new survey.
Research from TalkTalk found the use of smart plugs (typically used to connect voice assistants to a power source) has increased by 47% over the past year, with difficult homework being blamed for the surge.
Three quarters of parents said school work is more difficult now than when they were at school.
Concerningly, more than half – 52% – said they had given the wrong answers to their child's homework.
