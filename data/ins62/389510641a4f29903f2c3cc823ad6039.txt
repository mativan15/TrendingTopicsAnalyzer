June 3, 2022 / 12:04 PM / CBS/AP Tesla CEO Elon Musk wants to slash jobs at the electric carmaker based on a "super bad feeling" he has about the economy, Reuters reported Friday.Musk said he needs to cut about 10% of his workforce in an email sent to company executives, according to the Reuters report.  The memo, titled "pause all hiring worldwide," was sent two days after Musk panned remote work and said employees who don't return to their assigned offices should look for jobs elsewhere.  
 
"If you don't show up, we will assume you have resigned," he said in a follow-up email to the company's workers.
