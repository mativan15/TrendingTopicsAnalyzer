Through 21 games, the Patriots' record with Mac Jones as their starting quarterback is 11-10. They were 9-4 in his first 13 starts. They've been 2-6 since.

Before Jones took over, the Patriots were 7-9 with Cam Newton. Stretching back further, they were 2-4 in Tom Brady's last six games.

So 11-10 with Mac in '21-'22.
