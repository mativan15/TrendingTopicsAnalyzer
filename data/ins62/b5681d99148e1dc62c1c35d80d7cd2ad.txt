On February 14, 2022, six residents of Connecticut filed a class-action lawsuit accusing Hartford HealthCare (HHC), a hospital network, of 'anticompetitive conduct.' They allege that HHC, using its monopoly power, 'has forced patients and employers in Connecticut to pay higher prices for routine services that are often available at other hospitals only minutes away for substantially less.'Consolidation has given healthcare systems unprecedented power over payers, employers, and employees. Besides a brief statement sent to Axios, HHC has not refuted the lawsuit's claims.
