Patience is not just a virtue for a running back – it's a requirement.

Running backs often have to wait for a hole to open. Sometimes, they have to wait for a job to open up, too.

That's the case for FIU's Lexington 'Flex' Joseph, who spent the past three years in a backup role, never rushing for more than 273 yards in a season.

Through six games this season, though, Joseph leads FIU in rushing (career-high 291 yards), rushing average (5.9), scrimmage yards (career-high 396), kickoff-return yardage (380) and all-purpose yards (776).
