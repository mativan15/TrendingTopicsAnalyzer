Carrefour is looking at 2022 with confidence as it works on a new strategy that will allow the French retailer to step up digital expansion and be more resilient amid an increasingly uncertain environment, its boss said on Friday.Carrefour, which last year failed to tie up with Canada's Couche-Tard and France's Auchan, has the financial means to expand as a standalone company, Chairman and Chief Executive Alexandre Bompard also told shareholders.'Our group never had to face so many challenges,' Bompard said, citing the COVID and the climate crisis, resulting disruptions to supply chains and inflationary pressures made worse by the crisis in Ukraine.
