Iranian state television aired a video apparently showing that calm had returned to Tehran's Evin prison on Sunday after a fire broke out there overnight, as unrest sparked by Mahsa Amini's death in police custody last month.Iranian authorities said the workshop had been set on fire "after a fight among a number of prisoners convicted of financial crimes and theft". Evin holds many detainees facing security charges, including Iranians with dual nationality.Asked about the prison fire, US President Joe Biden told reporters during a campaign trip on Saturday to Portland, Oregon that the Iranian government was "so oppressive" and that he was surprised by the courage of the Iranian protesters.
