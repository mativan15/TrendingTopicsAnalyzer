An ex-Ohio police chief used his badge in a machine gun trafficking scheme aimed at reselling more than 200 weapons of war, prosecutors said.
Dorian LaCourse was sentenced to three years of probation for his role in buying fully automatic machine guns that were then resold at a much higher price, the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Indiana said.
LaCourse, who used to oversee a police department in a tiny Ohio village, will spend six of those months in home confinement.
Federal laws ban the purchase or transfer of fully automatic machine guns unless for law enforcement, an exception LaCourse, 66, exploited.
