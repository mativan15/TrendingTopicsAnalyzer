Under new plans being considered by the Government, the energy price cap on household bills will soon come to an end, as experts and energy companies criticise the current system. This market overhaul of a system that kept energy bills for households down would come into place once Prime Minister Liz Truss' £60billion Energy Price Guarantee Scheme comes to an end, after the winter of 2023. From October 1st, Ofgem was set to raise the price cap on household energy bills to £3,549 per year, from an already record high £1,971 in April.
