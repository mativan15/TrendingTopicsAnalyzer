More than $1.8 million has been raised online in less than a day for the slain Robb Elementary School teacher whose husband then died of a broken heart.
The GoFundMe was launched to raise money for the four children of Irma Garcia — one of two teachers slain alongside their 19 young students — and her husband of 24 years, Joe, who died of a heart attack Thursday.
'I truly believe Joe died of a broken heart and losing the love of his life of more than 25 years was too much to bear,' confirmed Debra Austin, one of Irma Garcia's cousins who started the fundraiser Thursday.
