Imugene Limited (ASX:IMU) shareholders might understandably be very concerned that the share price has dropped 36% in the last quarter. But over five years returns have been remarkably great. Indeed, the share price is up a whopping 795% in that time. So it might be that some shareholders are taking profits after good performance. The most important thing for savvy investors to consider is whether the underlying business can justify the share price gain. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 60% decline over the last twelve months.
