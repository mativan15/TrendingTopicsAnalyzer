That 6-foot-6, 328-pound, 'lean,' long-armed bulldozer at defensive tackle for the Miami Hurricanes is the kind of guy who quietly makes his edge rushers thrilled.

Darrell Jackson, a sophomore who became UM's 11th transfer and fifth on the defensive line when he left the Maryland Terrapins for Miami before the season, has started the past five games for the Hurricanes. As is often the case with talented defensive tackles, Jackson, who especially savors stopping the run, is in the background plugging up the middle so his ends can get their glory.
