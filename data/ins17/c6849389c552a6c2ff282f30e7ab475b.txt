At 4am yesterday morning Liz Truss was awake and sending texts to her closest allies. Pandemonium had broken out in the House of Commons the night before, and the Prime Minister was aware her premiership was on the brink.But despite the mayhem, Ms Truss was not yet ready to give up. After vowing just hours earlier that she was "a fighter, not a quitter", she was ready to do whatever she could to salvage her job.Officials and aides in No10 had worked through the night to try and restore stability.
