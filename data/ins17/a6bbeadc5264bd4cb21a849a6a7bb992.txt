BMW reveals the all-new all-electric i7 at the 2022 Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este BMW AG 
Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este is a dazzling affair.

This year, among the parade, is the i7, BMW's pinnacle electric car. Framed by the 16th-century villa, its presence is discreet — almost shy. This is not a product that wants to shout its wealth and knowledge.
