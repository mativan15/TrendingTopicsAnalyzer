Bellevue-based biotech Viome Life Sciences has raised over $67 million in Series C funding.

The funding will go toward growing the company's health screening test business, said Viome founder and CEO Naveen Jain. He added that the company has 150 employees right now, of which all but about 25 are based in the Seattle area, and the company will likely grow to about 200 total employees in a year.

"All of our lab is automated. All of our supplement manufacturing is automated," Jain said. "Unlike a warehouse at Amazon, we don't require, as the company grows, more people to push the stuff around.
