CLEMSON, S.C. — Clemson coach Brad Brownell looks around at ACC meetings and sees fewer and fewer faces who've been doing it as long as him.

Brownell is entering his 13th season with the Tigers – only Leonard Hamilton of Florida State and Tony Bennett of Virginia have held positions in the Atlantic Coast Conference longer – and hopes the season doesn't become a game-by-game referendum on his job status.

'It's challenging to stay in the profession at this level,' Brownell said. 'I'm proud of it because I think it speaks to the culture of what we do in our program.
