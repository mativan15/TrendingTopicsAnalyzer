Eve Sleep, the online mattress retailer, was forced to bring in administration after a distressing decision to call off the potential sale of their business. It would be difficult for them to survive as an independent company in the current market situation, they said. Cheryl Calverley, the CEO, said their company had a tough time keeping their business alive, but just the scale of Eve Sleep wasn't sufficient to face the economic fiasco that has taken over the past six months. Since June, the company saw a general downtrend in the sale of their home furnishing.
