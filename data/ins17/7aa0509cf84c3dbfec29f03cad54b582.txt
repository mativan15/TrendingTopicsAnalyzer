It looks like Overwatch 2 players have found new, hidden areas in old maps which may hint at future content in the hero shooter's pipeline.Players, such as TikTok user @lowendwibs, have found inaccessible sections in established maps that have been added in Overwatch 2. As of this writing, this includes King's Row, Havana, and Rialto, all of which now have new, unused areas on the map that you can't reach through normal gameplay. However, if you play a match on any of these maps and watch the replay, you can move the camera around freely as you spectate.
