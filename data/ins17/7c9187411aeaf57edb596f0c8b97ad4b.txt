May 30—As she ran through the entrance of Folsom Field on Monday, Valentyna Veretska held a Ukrainian flag with both hands above her head, letting it fly in the breeze behind her.

There was already a roar from the sizeable crowd inside the stadium as they cheered the professional runners to the finish of the 42nd Bolder Boulder. The volume of that roar increased as Veretska and her flag ran to the finish line.

Afterward, Veretska, 31, had goose bumps on her arms as she humbly recalled that moment.
