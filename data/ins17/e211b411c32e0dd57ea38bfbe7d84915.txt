Russian state television has mocked the Platinum Jubilee celebrations in the UK as the Queen was forced to miss the Thanksgiving service on the second day of the bank holiday weekend.'With great reluctance', the monarch was not present at Friday's celebrations as the Queen reportedly experienced 'some discomfort' during Thursday's events, suggesting her health concerns had been prioritised. Russian hosts claimed the Queen's 'discomfort' was the result of Russian interference as Putin's media continues to spout pro-war propaganda.
