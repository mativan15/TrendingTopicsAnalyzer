Ex-WeWork CEO Adam Neumann and his wife are launching a new startup called Flowcarbon.

The project aims to use the blockchain to let businesses trade carbon credits using crypto tokens.

Those tokens have been dubbed Goddess Nature Tokens, or GNTs.

Carbon trading is getting the crypto treatment, and its latest orchestrator is none other than WeWork's eccentric cofounder.

Three years after being ousted as CEO, Adam Neumann is launching a new startup called Flowcarbon that wants to put carbon credits on blockchain technology.
