Paul Ryan praised Rep. Tom Rice for his impeachment vote when campaigning for him in South Carolina.

Ryan said a lot of people "wanted to vote like Tom," but they "just didn't have the guts to do it."

He criticized Trump for his "vengeance" in backing primary challengers to Republicans who cross him.

Former House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday that more House Republicans would have voted to impeach former President Donald Trump after the January 6 Capitol riot if they'd had the "guts" to do so.
