A team of U of T Engineering researchers, led by Professor Omar F. Khan (BME), has partnered with biotechnology company Moderna to develop next-generation RNA platform technologies. This industry-university strategic research agreement is the first academic partnership under the University of Toronto and Moderna's collaborative partnership framework agreement. 
 'We are making new kinds of nanotechnology and RNA to help prevent and cure diseases. Together, we're driving new technological innovations to provide patients with even more options for highly efficacious RNA-based medicines,' says Khan, who holds the Canada Research Chair in Nucleic Acid Therapeutics.
