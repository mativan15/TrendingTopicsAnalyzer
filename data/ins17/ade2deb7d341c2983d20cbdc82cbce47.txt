Union Minister for Tourism, Culture and Development of Northeast region G. Kishan Reddy, on Thursday, accused the TRS Government of indulging in cheap politicking due to the fear of losing Munugode bypoll.
'Why did it take eight years for the ruling party to realise there has been no development in the constituency and in other places across the State? Who has stopped them? They are firing salvos at us when we do not have an elected representative from the district,' he said, at a press conference from the party office.
