Expansions and additions to popular theme parks operated by Disney and Comcast's Universal Studios have been ongoing over the last dozen or so years as both companies have added new themed lands and rides to their parks.

Universal Orlando Resort started the theme park industry expansion in 2010 when it introduced the popular Wizarding World of Harry Potter land at Islands of Adventure in 2010 and added similar lands to Universal Studios Orlando in 2014 and Universal Hollywood in 2016.

Disney answered with the opening of Pandora - The World of Avatar land in Animal Kingdom at Disney World in Orlando in 2017 and Toy Story Land in Disney Hollywood Studios in Orlando in 2018.
