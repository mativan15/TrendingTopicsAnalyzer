When a group of five Grade 11 students at Eastwood Collegiate Institute in Kitchener, Ont., were asked if they were paying attention to the municipal election, they all said no.Aiden Devine says he can't vote yet, so he's not following the election as closely as maybe he should. But he also believes candidates could do a better job of trying to talk to him and his classmates."Outreach to younger people just isn't there," he said."I find a lot of the candidates tend to reach toward more of the older generation because they tend to vote more and care more.
