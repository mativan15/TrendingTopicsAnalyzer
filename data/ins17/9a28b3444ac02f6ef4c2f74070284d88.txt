There is an uptick in the demand for passenger vehicles this festive season, with preference leaning towards sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and hybrid models, according to Grant Thornton Bharat's auto survey. "With a 34 per cent year-on-year growth in vehicle sales in H1FY23, the passenger vehicle industry is gradually resurging from the pandemic. Ease in supply chain, a marked improvement in demand propelled by post pandemic festive sentiment and need for personal mobility are driving the sector as per our survey findings," Grant Thornton Bharat Partner and National Sector Leader (Auto) Saket Mehra said.
