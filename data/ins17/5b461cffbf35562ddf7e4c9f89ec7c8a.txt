PM assures Hyundai Motor of solutions over U.S. inflation law SEOUL, Oct. 19 (Yonhap) -- Prime Minister Han Duck-soo on Wednesday visited a research center of Hyundai Motor and sought to assure the carmaker that South Korea is determined to find solutions to address concerns over the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA gives tax credits only to electric vehicles assembled in North America, preventing South Korean carmakers from receiving such subsidies because they are yet to produce electric vehicles there.
