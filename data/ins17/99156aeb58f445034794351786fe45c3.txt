TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government will take appropriate steps against excessive currency market volatility, following the yen's slide to a fresh 32-year low and towards the key psychological barrier of 150 to the dollar.

"Recent rapid and one-sided yen declines are undesirable. We absolutely cannot tolerate excessively volatile moves driven by speculative trading," Suzuki told parliament on Thursday.

"We will continue to take appropriate steps against excess volatility, while watching currency market developments with a strong sense of urgency," he said.
