Bruce Bennett/Getty Images News Allstate (NYSE:ALL) rose 4.5% at least partly amid some speculation that activist investor Carl Icahn may have a stake in the insurer. The famed activist may have accumulated an undisclosed stake in Allstate (ALL), according to traders, who cited a Gordon Haskett note that was circulating. Allstate (ALL) didn't immediately respond to Seeking Alpha email request for comment. The Friday morning gain for Allstate came after the insurer plunged 13% on Thursday after it preannounced late Wednesday some Q3 results showing that the insurer is having a hard time keeping up with the rate of inflation.
