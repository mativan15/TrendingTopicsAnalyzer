The ‘Wagatha Christie' legal battle between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy will be staged in the West End for one night only.
Vardy v Rooney: The Wagatha Christie Trial has been adapted from a High Court transcript by Liv Hennessy and will be directed by Lisa Spirling.
The play will be produced by Eleanor Lloyd, who is behind the stage adaptation of Agatha Christie's Witness For The Prosecution currently running in London.
Theatre producer Eilene Davidson is also working on the project.
In the trial which gripped the nation earlier this summer, Vardy, 40, lost a libel battle against 36-year-old Rooney over a viral social media post after a High Court judge found it was ‘substantially true'.
