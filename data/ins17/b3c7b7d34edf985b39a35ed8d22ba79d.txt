Sergio Perez delivered the ideal response to Sky Sports pundit Martin Brundle as the Red Bull driver notched his first F1 Grand Prix win of the season in Monaco. In a thrilling finish, Perez held off Ferrari driver Carlos Sainz following a dramatic race, which was initially delayed due to heavy rain and then restarted after 30 laps following a crash from Haas driver Mick Schumacher.World championship leader Max Verstappen was third, whilst Charles Leclerc, who had started on pole but paid the price for a delayed first pit stop, finished fourth.
