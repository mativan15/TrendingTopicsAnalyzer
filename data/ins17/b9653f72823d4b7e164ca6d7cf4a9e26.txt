We may be paying a price for our pumpkin-spice cravings. A new study from the MagnifyMoney.com website has found that retailers routinely charge more for pumpkin-spice items than the standard versions of those same products. In fact, a lot more — on average, the pumpkin-spice 'tax,' as MagnifyMoney.com dubs it, is 14.1%. That's a significant increase from 2020, which was the last time MagnifyMoney looked at the pumpkin-spice pricing differential. At that time, the 'tax' was 8.8%. 'I think companies are finding it's a great way to capitalize on a seasonal trend,' says Ismat Mangla, executive editor of MagnifyMoney.
