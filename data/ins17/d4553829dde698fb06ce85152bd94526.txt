The family is looking to get a refund following the mishap (Image: Louise Turner / SWNS)The confusion occurred after mum-of-two, Louise Turner, spent £1,000 on a guesthouse that she claims was listed for the island. However, upon arrival, she and her family were dismayed to realise their booking was for a property 130 miles away. This meant Louise, and her husband Jose Pacheco, were forced to pay £1,000 for somewhere to stay, and are now looking for a refund.According to Louise, the mistake was made because the Welsh city was listed incorrectly online - under the Isle of Wight section.
