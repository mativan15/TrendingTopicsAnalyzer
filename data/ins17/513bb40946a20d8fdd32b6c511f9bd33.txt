Jun. 2—The Boston Celtics are going to the NBA Finals.

I'll admit, that's not a sentence I expected to be writing after watching them stumble through the first 50 games of the 2021-22 campaign with a .500 record. But Boston turned things around in an unpredictably massive way; now, they'll face Golden State starting tonight in Game 1 of what should be a wildly entertaining series.

As daunting as that challenge may appear, the Celtics are ready for this moment. They're battle tested, having gone through an Eastern Conference playoff gauntlet that included Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant's Brooklyn Nets, Giannis Antetokounmpo's defending champion Milwaukee Bucks, and Jimmy Butler's top-seeded Miami Heat.
