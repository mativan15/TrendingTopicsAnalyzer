'India's ‘techade' is here', the Prime Minister declared with conviction in his Independence Day speech at Red Fort. He was referring to the current decade that will see the Indian digital economy surpassing USD 1 trillion dollars. 5G, semiconductor manufacturing and new age technology sectors are on the cusp of booming into a behemoth of an opportunity for the Indian economy. Online gaming, a USD 2 billion dollars industry growing by more than 28% year-on-year, is one such sunrise sector.
The Prime Minister on multiple occasions has called on the game developers and the gamers to promote ‘Made in India' and ‘Made for India' games.
