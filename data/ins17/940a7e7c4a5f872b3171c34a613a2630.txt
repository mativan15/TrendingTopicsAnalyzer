Google is raising 'serious' concerns about a Liberal bill that seeks to require tech giants to pay media outlets in exchange for putting their news content online.
Bill C-18, which the government introduced in the spring, would create a framework within which 'digital news intermediaries,' or major online platforms, must negotiate deals with eligible news media.News organizations have largely hailed the bill, which is similar to a law passed in Australia last year, though some have raised concerns about the criteria used to determine which outlets are eligible.
