May 31, 2022, 2:20 PM UTCBy Ben KamisarMay's most expensive political race on the ad airwaves in May wasn't the closely fought Pennsylvania Senate GOP primary, which featured two wealthy frontrunners who sunk millions into their own campaign. It wasn't Georgia's high-profile GOP gubernatorial race, which saw former President Trump ante up, either. The race that drew the most ad spending in May, per ad-tracking firm AdImpact, was Illinois' gubernatorial race, a race where the primary won't be held until June 28.
