In the middle of San Francisco, there's a pilot production plant for Wildtype, one of a handful of cell-cultivated seafood companies in the US. Inside, it's growing sushi-grade coho salmon in tanks similar to those found in breweries – no fishing or farming required.Cultivation starts by taking a small sample from a living fish species. Cells then multiply as they would in nature in the large vessels and eventually become fatty and lean parts of a fish fillet.Depending on whom you talk to, fishless fish could be the next big thing in seafood production.
