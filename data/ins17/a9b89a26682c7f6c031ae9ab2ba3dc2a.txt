The war in Ukraine, and the resulting rise in the cost of living, has plunged millions more children into poverty in Eastern Europe and Central Asia in recent months, warns a study by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) published on Monday.

The war in Ukraine and rising inflation have plunged an additional four million children into poverty — an increase of 19% since 2021 — the study says, stressing that children bear the brunt of the economic crisis caused by the conflict.

It claims that while children make up 25% of the population, they account for nearly 40% of the 10.
