(Reuters) -Baker Hughes Co posted a quarterly loss on Wednesday, compared with a profit a year ago, hit by $230 million in restructuring and impairment charges relating to the oilfield services provider's latest reorganization.

The company during the recent quarter said it would simplify its organizational structure into two business units from four, one focused on oilfield equipment and services and another dedicated to industrial energy and technology, which includes its Turbomachinery and Process Solutions (TPS) business.
