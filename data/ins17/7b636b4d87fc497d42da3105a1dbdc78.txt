Manitobans may soon be able to buy alcohol at more places and pick up a variety of booze without running to different stores.The Progressive Conservative government introduced a bill Thursday that could allow private beer vendors to sell a full range of alcohol, including wine and spirits. Similarly, private wine stores would be allowed to stock spirits and beer.The changes would put the private stores in line with government-run outlets, which already offer all types of liquor products.'This will just expand Manitobans' ability to have access and to have more convenience when you're going shopping,' said Scott Fielding, the minister responsible for liquor and lotteries.
