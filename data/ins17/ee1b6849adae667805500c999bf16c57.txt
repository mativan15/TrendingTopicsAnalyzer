Construction contractors like Juventino Lozano of Sewerrat Underground and Leo Prozument of Restoration 1 get up every day in their Waukegan homes and often travel elsewhere for their work.

Lozano, Prozument and other contractors like them would like to do more of their business in and around Waukegan and are exploring ways to do just that.

Lozano often does jobs in Chicago, but lately he got a contract from Waukegan Community Unit School District 60.

'I love what I do,' said Lozano, a sewer excavator for over 35 years who has operated his own business for since 2019.
