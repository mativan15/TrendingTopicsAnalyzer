A queen covers another queen! Over the weekend, Blackpink kicked off their world tour in Seoul, South Korea, performing some of the group's greatest hits, while also giving its members — Lisa, Jennie, Jisoo, and Rosé — the chance to showcase their individuality during a solo segment of the show. Jisoo opened the solos portion by covering Camila Cabello's 'Liar.' Wearing a two-piece red outfit, Jisoo covered the song by the Fifth Harmony alum as she was surrounded by dancers, before adding her own choreography as red confetti rained over the crowd.
