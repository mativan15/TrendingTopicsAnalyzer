Microsoft (MSFT -1.53%) shares are under pressure on Thursday after the software giant lowered expectations for the current quarter. It is set to report these results in July.
Microsoft has a fortress balance sheet, and this is likely just a small blip in what continues to be an impressive growth story. But the reason behind the warning is likely to ripple through a wide number of companies during the second quarter. Microsoft is sounding the alarm that a strong U.S. dollar is going to impact results.
