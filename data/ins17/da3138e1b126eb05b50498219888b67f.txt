Oct. 16—With Oklahoma leading 21-14 in the second quarter, Kansas quarterback Jason Bean dropped back to pass and appeared to find a receiver a few yards upfield near the left sideline.

The only defender in the way was OU cornerback C.J. Coldon. Bean tried to loft it over Coldon, but he managed to jump and get a hand on it.

But he didn't stop there. As Coldon fell to the ground, the ball kept falling too, and Coldon managed to keep his balance enough to snag the ball before it fell to the turf.
