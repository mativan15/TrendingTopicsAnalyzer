The Pat And Aaron ShowBy Chris MathisOct 17, 2022On Monday, we "celebrated" a miserable Mascot Monday; well at least our Producer, Chris Mathis, did. We'll get into a disappointing loss for the Bucs on Sunday; we'll talk about the NFC before The College Football Rewind with Nick Wize! In the second hour of the show, we're joined by Greg Auman of The Athletic to hear his thoughts on Sunday's loss for the Bucs; we'll talk about the MLB postseason and more, including Things I Like and the X-Factor too! In the show's final hour, we'll talk more about Buccaneers football with YOU, share our thoughts on where this team is six games into the season, and more! Click play.
