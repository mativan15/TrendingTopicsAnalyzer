The new Chancellor needs to mend fences with the Bank of England and agree ways in which they can use their separate powers to produce a good answer for the UK economy. The big rise in interest rates on bonds owes a lot to the Bank's actions and to the US-led rise in rates, although the Government's critics want to blame it all on tax cuts. The Bank has come across as divided among itself, with the people concerned about orderly markets in disagreement with the ones wanting faster control of inflation.
