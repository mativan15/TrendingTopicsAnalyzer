UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — In today's highly competitive higher education job market, fledgling academics often find themselves facing an uphill climb when trying to land their first post-doctorate faculty position.
Looking to address the issue in a mutually beneficial way, Penn State's College of the Liberal Arts has partnered with the Office of the Vice President for Commonwealth Campuses (OVPCC) on the new Commonwealth Postdoctoral Teaching Fellow Program in the Liberal Arts.
The initiative gives doctoral students who have defended their dissertation the chance to apply for a one-year non-tenure-track position at a participating Penn State campus — Abington, Behrend, New Kensington and York are the initial four — with the possibility of renewal.
