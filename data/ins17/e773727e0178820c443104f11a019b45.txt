HARLINGEN — The city's revenues are rebounding after losing about $3 million during the coronavirus pandemic's shutdown.

After the COVID-19 outbreak in March 202o, funding sources including the Harlingen Municipal Auditorium, the sanitation department and the hotel occupancy tax fund lost hundreds of thousands of dollars amid the shutdown and the safety restrictions ordered to curb the spread of the virus.

"Considering we're coming out of a complete shutdown, it's looking good," Assistant City Manager Josh Ramirez said, noting the area's high vaccination rates amid plunging COVID-19 cases.
