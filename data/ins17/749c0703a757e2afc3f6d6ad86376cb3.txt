Those gifts attract curiosity and media scrutiny about their nature, appropriateness, the givers' motivations, but also the Queen's reaction and responses.Media outlets have widely reported the gifts presented for the Platinum Jubilee by Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev of a beautiful Karabakh horse and two horse sculptures by sculptor Faiq Hajiyev.
