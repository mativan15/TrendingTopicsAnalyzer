Techstars Seattle has named Marius Ciocirlan, co-founder of the filmmaker and photographer marketplace ShareGrid, as the business accelerator's new managing director.

The move, announced Tuesday, comes after Isaac Kato, Techstars Seattle's previous managing director, stepped down at the end of September after leading the accelerator for three years. Ciocirlan's first day is Oct. 31, according to Sarah Studer, Techstars Seattle's director of platform. Ciocirlan's start lines up with the beginning of the accelerator's new class.
