NEW DELHI: Led by a non-stop rally for the last four days amid heavy buying by domestic investors and decent quarterly earnings, headline equity index Nifty50 on Wednesday crossed its 50-DMA to scale past the 17,500 mark. Global brokerage firm CLSA's technical analyst Laurence Balanco said the index can touch the 18,200 mark by November. "The Indian market has been resilient. India has outperformed the S&P by roughly 15% year-to-date but in the near term it can test the 18,200 mark in November," Balanco said, adding that Dalal Street will keep outperforming Wall Street.
