We think that DexCom stock (NASDAQ NDAQ : DXCM) is currently a better pick than Insulet stock (NASDAQ: PODD), given DexCom's DXCM better prospects and comparatively lower valuation. DXCM stock trades at a P/S ratio of 11x, compared to 14x for PODD stock. We believe that this gap in the valuation of these two companies does not make sense, given that DexCom has demonstrated better revenue growth and profitability than Insulet.
