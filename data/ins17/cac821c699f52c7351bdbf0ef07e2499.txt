ARLINGTON, Texas — Oklahoma State sophomore reliever Ryan Bogusz delivered when the Cowboys needed him most.

And the Cowboys are one win from another Big 12 championship game appearance.

Bogusz threw eight strong innings in his first-career start to lead the fourth-seeded Cowboys to an 8-1 victory over fifth-seeded Texas in the Big 12 semifinals early Saturday at Globe Life Field.

The Cowboys now need to beat the Longhorns in the rematch at 4 p.m. to clinch a spot in the championship game for a third straight season.
