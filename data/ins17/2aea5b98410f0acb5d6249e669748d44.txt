A mammoth new workplace Bill would ban pay secrecy clauses so companies can't prevent their staff from discussing salaries with each other.The legislation has been signed off by federal cabinet and is aimed to help low income workers negotiate higher pay packets and better conditions.Plans are in place for Workplace Relations Minister Tony Burke to put the Secure Jobs, Better Pay Bill before parliament next week.The new rules will put an end to pay secrecy clauses that stop employees at a company from discussing how they much get paid among each other.
