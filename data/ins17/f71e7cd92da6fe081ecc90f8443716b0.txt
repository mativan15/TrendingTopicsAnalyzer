Canada's men's soccer team has refused to play a scheduled World Cup warmup match against Panama amid a contract dispute between the players and the sport's national governing body. Canada Soccer confirmed the match, scheduled for Sunday at Vancouver's B.C. Place, had been cancelled less than two hours before kickoff. The Canadian players issued a statement Sunday afternoon saying they decided not to play the game because the negotiations over a new deal had been 'unnecessarily prolonged.' 'It's time we take a stand for the future of soccer in Canada,' the statement said.
