Davide Sanclimenti believes English women "love" him but admitted he is "picky" when it comes to dating as he prepares to enter Love Island this summer. The 27-year-old business owner based in Manchester - originally from Rome, Italy - is among the select group of singletons to head to the new villa in Mallorca for the eighth series of the popular ITV2 show, which returns to our screens on Monday June 6 at 9pm. The self-proclaimed "Italian stallion" says he has a "good heart" and is "a very deep person" as he looks for a meaningful relationship on the Spanish island and can't wait to get stuck into the action.
