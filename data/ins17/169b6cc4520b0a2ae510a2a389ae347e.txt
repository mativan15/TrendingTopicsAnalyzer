Henry Jones felt like he was at the end of the line in the summer of 1991. "There was no way out," he remembered thinking. "I prayed and was tired, but I couldn't see no way out." Jones had been homeless in Washington, DC for 11 years, and the years had taken their toll. "I started to get sicker and sicker," he said.
