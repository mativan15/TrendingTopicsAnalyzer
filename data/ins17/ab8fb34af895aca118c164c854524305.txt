Tommy Fury has been warned Jake Paul has legitimate knockout power ahead of their potential fight. Paul and Fury were scheduled to meet last December, but Fury pulled out just two weeks before the fight after suffering a broken rib and bacterial infection. The Love Island star has since improved to 8-0 in the hopes of rescheduling a bout with Paul. Following Fury's withdrawal, Paul faced Tyron Woodley in a rematch after outpointing the ex-UFC champion earlier that year. Paul picked up his fifth professional win by way of a brutal knockout against Woodley and will fight for the first time this year on August 13.
