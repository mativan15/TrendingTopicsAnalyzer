BJP national vice-president and former Bengal chief Dilip Ghosh has been cautioned by the central leadership over his comments in the media about some of his party colleagues in the state. In a letter, BJP national general secretary and headquarters in-charge Arun Singh asked Ghosh to "refrain from going to the media, both print and electronics, and comment about his party colleagues in Bengal and outside". His comments have been a reason for "anguish to state leaders and caused embarrassment to the central leadership", Singh wrote in the letter, dated May 30.
