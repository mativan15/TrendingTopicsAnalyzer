The Communist government of Cuba made a rare request for aid from Washington in September after Hurricane Ian knocked out power to the entire island of 11 million people, killed three people and drove thousands from their homes. The United States will work with independent organizations to provide the aid, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement.
