The Texas attorney general filed a privacy lawsuit against Google on Thursday, accusing the internet company of collecting Texans' facial and voice recognition information without their explicit consent.

Ken Paxton, the state's attorney general, said Google had violated a state consumer protection law that requires companies to inform citizens and get their consent before capturing their biometric identifiers, including fingerprints, voiceprints and a 'record of hand or face geometry.'

Violators of the law face fines of up to $25,000 per violation.
