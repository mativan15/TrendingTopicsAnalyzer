Both versions of the i4 are powered by a 83.9-kilowatt-hour battery pack, of which 81.5 kWh is actually usable. The i4 can accept DC fast charging at speeds up to 200 kW, which means it's theoretically possible to bring the battery from a 10% state of charge to 80% in about 30 minutes. Plugged into a Level 2 outlet, the i4 charges at 11 kW, so it takes just over 8 hours to fully replenish the battery. Not bad -- both of these charging speeds are on the better side of competitive for compact EVs.Where the two i4s differ the most is power output.
