Amazon might have to pay 900 million pounds ($1 billion) in Britain over allegations of abusing its dominant position by favouring its own products.
Consumer rights advocate Julie Hunter plans to bring the collective action on behalf of British consumers who have made purchases on Amazon since October 2016, lawyers representing her said.
Law firm Hausfeld, which represents Hunter, said on Thursday that Amazon has breached competition law by using ‘a secretive and self-favouring algorithm' to promote its own products through the ‘Buy Box' feature on its website.
