'Both my dad and mom had their own business,' Ally Robotics founder and CEO Mitch Tolson tells TechCrunch. 'My mom had a sign company. Every single weekend and nights during the week, I was installing neon signs, welding up frames, digging trenches, holes for electrical, all of it.'

The executive says those formative years on construction sites were part of the inspiration behind the Washington-based startup's formation. The central conceit behind the company is simple enough: What if we could train robots more like we train people?

The company, which pitched today onstage in Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt, has developed a combination hardware and software solution designed to make it easier to deploy these automated solutions for those without coding/robotics experience.
