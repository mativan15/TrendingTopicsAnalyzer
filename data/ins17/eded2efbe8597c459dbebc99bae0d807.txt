Shares of media-streaming technology veteran Roku (ROKU 0.34%) have taken an 85% haircut in 2022. At the same time, the business is booming in many ways.
Trailing sales are up 31%, as measured at the end of each year's second quarter. The company boosted its sales and marketing budget by an even steeper 73% over the same period. The generous marketing spending suggests that management sees this year as an excellent time to invest in future growth.
