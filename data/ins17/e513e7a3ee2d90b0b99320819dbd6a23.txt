Buck declared bankruptcy in 2020. Declaring bankruptcy would allow Buck to avoid paying 50 Cent the $250,000 he owed 50 Cent for failing to provide two new albums for the G-Unit label. 50 Cent and his legal team have filed proceedings to collect on the debt, claiming he is hiding high value assets, according to AllHipHop.
