I go detecting to get out and about. It's lovely in our beautiful countryside with my friends Mick and Dave. I don't care what the weather is like: I've detected in the snow, a blizzard, thunderstorm, heatwave.I started detecting at 11, 42 years ago, on local beaches, and took it up seriously in 1990. Mick and Dave have 50 years' detecting experience between them. I met Mick, a dairy herd manager, while camping at a metal detecting rally in Climping. We pitched our tents next to each other and really hit it off.
