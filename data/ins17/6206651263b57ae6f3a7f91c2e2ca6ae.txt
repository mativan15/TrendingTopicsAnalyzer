This book is an astonishing recital. Reading it practically at one sitting, I had two emotions on laying it down. First, one is distinctly grateful to the author for a delicate and restrained — although detailed — pictureof his comings and goings during the long hours. If there is a chamber of horrors, it is not of Mr. Walker's making. I found I was quite enjoying myself in the company of the stalwart crew to which he belonged. The book is like a deftly drawn picture of an operating-room, recorded through the work and the gossip and sometimes the play of the doctors and nurses — and patients.
