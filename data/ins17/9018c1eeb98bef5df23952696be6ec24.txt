The Formula One U.S. Grand Prix is back in Austin.

This weekend, Circuit of The Americas is hosting its 10th F1 race and its first under a new contract that runs through 2026.

The global automotive sport arrived in Austin in 2012. The Texas capital has continued to evolve as a hub of tech and commerce over the past decade, so it felt like a good time to examine the business impact of this mammoth event. In addition to being the focus of the international racing community this weekend, COTA will be a hot spot for CEOs and billionaires, with deals getting done over drinks in the Paddock Club.
