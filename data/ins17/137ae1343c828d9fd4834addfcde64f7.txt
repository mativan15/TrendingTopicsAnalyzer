Fate Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:FATE) shareholders might understandably be very concerned that the share price has dropped 36% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last half decade have been spectacular. In that time, the share price has soared some 387% higher! Arguably, the recent fall is to be expected after such a strong rise. But the real question is whether the business fundamentals can improve over the long term. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 67% drop, in the last year.
