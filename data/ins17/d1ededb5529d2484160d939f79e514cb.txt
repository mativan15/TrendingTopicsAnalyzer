Dozens of House Republicans proposed new legislation this week that would prohibit the use of federal funds for sexually explicit programs, such as the wave of drag shows and drag queen story hour events that have popped up across the country.

Rep. Mike Johnson's "Stop the Sexualization of Children Act" is an attempt by the GOP to prevent taxpayers from funding events they say expose kids to sexualized themes and "radical gender theory" programs at young ages.

"The Democrat Party and their cultural allies are on a misguided crusade to immerse young children in sexual imagery and radical gender ideology," said Johnson, a Louisiana Republican who is vice chair of the House Republican Conference.
