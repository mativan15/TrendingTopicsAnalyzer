The Assam police have arrested four people with alleged links to Bangladesh-based terror outfit Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) which is affiliated to the Al Qaeda in Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Monday. Chief minister Sarma took to Twitter to announce the arrests of Sadek Ali and Jakibul Ali in Tamulpur district and Habel Ali and Abu Raihan in Nalbari district. 'We are determined to root out jihadi elements from Assam,' Sarma wrote, mentioning that both Sadek and Jakibul had lured youth to join ABT.
