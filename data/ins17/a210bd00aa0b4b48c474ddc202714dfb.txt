Isaiah Bryant likens campaigning for city council in Mississauga, Ont., to preparing for his upcoming G2 road test – the longer the 20-year-old does it, the more confident he feels.

'The more you do it and the more comfortable you get with it, the more you'll be able to progress and get to where you're trying to go,' he says.

It's Bryant's first time running for elected office – if he had tried for a spot on council in the last election in 2018, he would have been too young to put his name forward.
