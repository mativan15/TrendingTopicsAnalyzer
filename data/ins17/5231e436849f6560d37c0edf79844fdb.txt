The government Monday suspended with immediate effect senior IAS officer Jitendra Narain, accused of rape in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, according to the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Two serving bureaucrats — Narain and R L Rishi, posted as Labour Commissioner in A&N Islands — have been accused of sexual assault and gangrape by a 21-year-old woman in Port Blair.
According to a Union home ministry statement, the government is committed to ensuring zero-tolerance towards the acts of indiscipline by its officials irrespective of their rank and status, especially with regard to incidents involving the dignity of women.
