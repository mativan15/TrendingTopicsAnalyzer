Business chiefs have hit out at post-Brexit trading rules, with one describing life outside the EU as "the same nightmare week after week".Mark Brearley, who runs Kaymet, which makes tea trolleys and other kitchen equipment, said both the cost and red tape involved in the exporting of goods to the EU has increased.He said that a large proportion of his time is spent with "things going wrong" and that the EU feels like "the hardest place in the world to ship things to sometimes."His comments in an interview with The Guardian come as Brussels and London remain locked in a row over Brexit's Northern Ireland protocol.
