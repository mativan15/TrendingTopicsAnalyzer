The Class of 2022 will be inducted in an official ceremony at 6 p.m. Oct. 29 at the Sanborn Activity and Event Center in DeLand. Tickets cost $30 per person and can be purchased online.

The new honorees will also be recognized at halftime of the Hatters' homecoming football game against Drake earlier in the day.
