Singer Ed Sheeran can now add skincare to his growing business portfolio, as he is launching a Factor 70 suncream, explaining that his own complexion will be a good advert for the brand

Singer Ed Sheeran hopes to become the newest superstar on the block...by selling suncream.

Superstar Ed, 31, worth a sizzling £260million, already flogs Jackson Pollock-inspired art, has his own restaurant and a management company.

And he reckons his pale, red headed complexion will be a good advert for his own range of ultra-strong Factor 70 cream.
