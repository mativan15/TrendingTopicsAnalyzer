Top-ranked Tennessee leads the field in the 2022 NCAA Division I college baseball tournament, with the field of 64 teams all looking to secure a trip to Omaha and a spot in the College World Series. The Vols are one of nine teams from the SEC in the field, which ties the ACC for the most by any conference. However, reigning national champion Mississippi State will not have a chance to defend its title after failing to qualify for this year's tournament. The Regionals will be played June 3-6 at 16 sites, hosted by the top 16 overall seeds.
