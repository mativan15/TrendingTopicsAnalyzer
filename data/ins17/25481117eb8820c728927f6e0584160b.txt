David Rhoads said the application for student loan forgiveness was so easy, he was still in bed as he filled out the form.

'I did it in bed just as I was waking up, probably took less than a minute or two,' he wrote to CNN on Monday, adding that he submitted the form during the beta testing period over the weekend.

Rhoads, who lives in Chicago and works as a data scientist, said he has been paying on his loans since he finished graduate school about 10 years ago.

'I was staring down the barrel at restarting payments,' he said, referring to the pause on loan payments during the Covid-19 pandemic.
