The Delhi High Court Monday directed the Social Welfare Department, Delhi government, to remove 'iron gates, barriers and temporary structures' from the premises of a deaf school in a plea claiming that the department was 'usurping' the school building and the grounds over the past 14 years.
A single-judge bench of Justice Yashwant Varma granted three months time to the government to vacate the school premises. The HC in the interim directed the government to 'remove forthwith' any 'iron gates, barriers or other temporary structures' erected by the department that 'deny access to school playgrounds'.
