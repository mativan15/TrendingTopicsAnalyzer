Penny Mordaunt was immediately met with a huge roar of laughter from the opposite benches after saying Liz Truss was ‘detained on urgent business'.
The Prime Minister was accused of ‘running scared' after failing to show up for Keir Starmer's urgent question on her troubled financial plans.
In her place, she sent Ms Mordaunt, who told MPs: ‘With apologies to the Leader of the Opposition and the House, the PM is detained on urgent business… and I'm afraid you'll have to make do with me.'
It comes after the prime minister refused to face MPs after sacking Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng on Friday.
