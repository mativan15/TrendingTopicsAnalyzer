Published: 08:03 EDT, 15 October 2022 | Updated: 08:05 EDT, 15 October 2022 MPs loyal to Liz Truss have labelled those plotting against her 'a bunch of hyenas' who refuse to accept the outcome of the Tory leadership election, despite their own growing unease.The PM's backers have suggested her removal would be 'suicide', amid reports that MPs are backing a joint ticket of her former leadership rivals, Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt, to take over in running the country.In a speech yesterday, which came shortly after she sacked Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, the Prime Minister made a humiliating U-turn on her flagship economic policy on plans to keep corporation tax at 19p.
