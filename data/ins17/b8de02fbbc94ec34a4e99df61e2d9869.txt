British Prime Minister Liz Truss has vowed to lead her party to the next general election but there is speculation she could be moved on long before she gets that chance. Britain's Daily Star newspaper has asked if Ms Truss will outlive a lettuce, running a video live stream to watch it decompose in real time.There are five days left before this lettuce outlasts its shelf life — the bet being that's longer than before Ms Truss either steps down, or is ousted by her own party.Why is Truss in peril?Ms Truss has backtracked on nearly all tax cuts pitched in her disastrous mini-budget — a U-turn she left to her new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, to announce.
