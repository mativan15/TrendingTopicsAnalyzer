New Delhi: State-owned CIL did not increase the price of domestic dry fuel in spite of the unprecedented rise in the global price of coal, the government on Monday said. Coal India (CIL), which accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output, boosted its production considerably in the recent past and managed to overcome shortage of dry fuel faced by thermal power plants, coal minister Pralhad Joshi said. While addressing the National Coal Conclave & Exhibition-2022 here, the minister urged the public sector undertakings to compete with the private sector in coal mine auction and early production.
