Roku (ROKU -5.12%) is moving into the smart home space. The company, best known for its eponymous TV services platform, has partnered with Wyze -- maker of connected cameras, video doorbells, and smart light bulbs -- to brand a line of products that will be available exclusively at Walmart.
The Roku-branded smart home products share much of Wyze's design DNA, and they are also similarly priced. However, the pitch from the entertainment company Roku is that the smart home products will also integrate with the Roku smart TV platform -- which could be a boon for consumers.
