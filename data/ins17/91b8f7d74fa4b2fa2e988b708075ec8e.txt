Wipro executive chairman Rishad Premji, while addressing the Nasscom Product Conclave 2022, has said that IT companies are currently facing a huge challenge in building a sense of connectedness between their employees and the organization.

While explaining why it is a challenge, Premji said that, "Of its 260,000 strong workforce, around 100,000 are new recruits who have joined in the last 30 months. We have less than 10 per cent of people coming in and we have 30 per cent of our people living in tier II and tier III cities which are their hometowns.
