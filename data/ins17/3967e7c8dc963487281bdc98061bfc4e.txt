Latin American crypto exchange Lemon has integrated with TravelX – a tokenized travel products marketplace – to allow its users buy airline tickets, the company announced Tuesday.

TravelX went live in late September offering tickets for low-cost Argentine airline Flybondi that are converted into non-fungible tokens called NFTickets after purchase.

Beginning this month, each Lemon user will be allowed to purchase up to two tickets on TravelX with USDC from their Lemon wallet and receive 50% cash back in bitcoin, with a 100 USDC limit per transaction, the company said.
