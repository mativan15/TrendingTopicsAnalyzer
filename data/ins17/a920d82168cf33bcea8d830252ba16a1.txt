Seeking to capitalise on the situation, the Left-wing NUPES parliamentary coalition – now the main opposition group – is staging a march on Sunday that it hopes will be a major show of force 'against the high cost of living and climate inaction'.
Jean-Luc Mélenchon, 70, the fiery figurehead of NUPES' main coalition party, France Unbowed, set the tone this week by comparing Sunday's demonstration to the Oct 5, 1789 March on Versailles. Seen as a turning point in the French Revolution, an angry mob attacked royal Paris over the high price of bread and forced King Louis XVI to return with them to Paris the following day.
