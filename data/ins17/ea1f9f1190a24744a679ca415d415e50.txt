John Cleese has taken aim at Tory 'sleaze' and 'ineptitude', insisting now is the time to 'throw ‘em out'. The comedian, of Monty Python and Fawlty Towers fame, is adamant, however, that neither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats are the answer, too, branding the politics of the day a 'confusing mess'.Mr Cleese was addressing the latest conference of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Manchester earlier this month when, after praising the thoughtfulness of those present, he blasted not only the recent but the past decade of Tory rule.
