Britain has gone through four prime ministers in recent years, but one thing has remained steady through the political upheaval — Downing Street's guard cat. Liz Truss resigned as prime minister on Oct. 20, 2022. Meanwhile, Larry, the gray-and-white tabby known as the 'mouser of Downing Street,' went viral just 10 days prior for protecting his turf against a wayward fox. 

 Larry (of course) has a Twitter account, and was pawing snarky tweets all through the political turmoil. At 15 years old, Larry is a senior citizen in kitty years.
