A 24-year-old man accused of attacking and robbing another man at gunpoint in Sudbury earlier this month has been arrested and charged, police say. The accused was travelling in a vehicle with a 48-year-old man shortly after 4 a.m. Oct. 7 when he allegedly took out a gun, forced the victim out of the vehicle and assaulted him before stealing an undisclosed amount of money and several personal items, Greater Sudbury Police Service said in a news release Monday. It is believed to be a targeted incident between two people who know each other, police said.
