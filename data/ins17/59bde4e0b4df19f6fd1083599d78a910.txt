A furious mum claims a builder left her with a "wonky" and unfinished conservatory after she forked out £3,500. Care worker Rebecca Jordan said she's been in tears over the "unlevel" new building and her garden looking 'like a bomb had hit it'.According to BirminghamLive, neighbours have allegedly complained about building materials left outside the home in Redditch, Worcestershire. As a result, Rebecca claimed she has spent nights crying after handing over £3,500 for the works, despite an initial price of £2,000 being agreed.
