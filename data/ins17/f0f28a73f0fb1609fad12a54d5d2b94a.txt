Elon Musk emailed Tesla executives on Thursday, Reuters reports, telling them the company needs to pause hiring worldwide and cut its workforce by about 10 percent. At the end of 2021, Tesla said in a filing that it had 99,290 employees worldwide. In the email seen by Reuters, Musk cites his 'super bad feeling' about the economy.
One thing to note is that widespread layoffs aren't an unusual practice for Musk and Tesla. It cut hundreds of workers in October 2017, nine percent of staff in June 2018, and about seven percent in January 2019, then cut salaries and furloughed employees in April 2020.
