Helen Fagert hopes the empty boxes in her office at work will soon be filled with Christmas gifts for local kids who otherwise might wake up with nothing under the tree.

Ashley King State Farm in Charlotte is one of 300 business collecting donations for Toys for Tots.

'Nothing can replace the joy of watching your child open up a gift and just be free of any financial stressor,' Fagert said. 'We're super excited to have it in our office this year, because it helps us band together as a community.
