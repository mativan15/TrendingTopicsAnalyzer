Ian Tuttle Thesis Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) stock has surged as much as 20% since the metaverse gaming company reported key metrics for September. Arguably the most important reference point "bookings" was up 11% - 15% year over year, increasing to $212 million and $219 million for September. Although the numbers were not stellar, investors cheered the better-than expected net bookings - which absent any FX headwinds would have increased as much as 17% - 21% year over year. Reflecting on Roblox' September metrics, paired with an oddly bullish price action, I continue to like Roblox as a speculative stock-pick.
