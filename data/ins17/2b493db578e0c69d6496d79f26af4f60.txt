The veteran receiver just wanted to be on the field.

Frustration is building in Carolina and rightfully so. The Panthers are now 1-5 on the season following Sunday's 24-10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams and in that game, there was a situation that unfolded that could lead to change in the coming days.

Wide receiver Robbie Anderson was upset about being pulled off the field and went directly over to receivers coach Joe Dailey to let him know how unhappy he was. The two exchanged words and it resulted in Anderson not seeing the field again.
