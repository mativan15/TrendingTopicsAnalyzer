An assistant sub-inspector of police and a police constable from the Sir JJ Marg police were arrested on Saturday for allegedly extorting Rs 10,000 from a diamond merchant by threatening to file an FIR against him. The matter came to light after the complainant took to Twitter and narrated his ordeal, tagging Mumbai Police's official Twitter handle.
This is the second case this year from South Mumbai where policemen have been booked for targeting businessmen in the same fashion. In March this year, an IPS officer was booked for alleged extortion along with some police officers of the L T Marg police station.
