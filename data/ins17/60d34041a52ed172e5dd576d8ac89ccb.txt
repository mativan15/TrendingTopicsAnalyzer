Manxman Billy Harris is targeting more main draw opportunities after an impressive few days at the LTA's Surbiton Trophy, writes Oli Dickson Jefford in Surbiton.

Harris, who benefits from the LTA Top 25 programme which allows access to the NTC courts and facilities for the top 25 ranked British male and female players on ATP/WTA rankings and can also benefit from the LTA's domestic competition calendar of Pro and Prize money tournaments and a Tournament Bonus Scheme, beat William Jansen and Ramkumar Ramanathan to reach the singles main draw at the ATP Challenger Tour event.
