Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Senate hopeful Evan McMullin (I) engaged in a heated back and forth over Congress' certification of the 2020 election on Jan. 6, 2021 and Lee's alleged initial support for overturning the results.

During a televised debate for the Utah Senate race on Monday that took place at Utah Valley University, the candidates were asked if President Biden fairly won the 2020 election. Lee affirmed so before later pivoting to talk about his support for the Electoral College, arguing that the 'authority to conduct elections remain in state hands.
