pandemin/iStock via Getty Images Antero Resources (NYSE:AR) will likely benefit from the market condition in the following quarters as it did in the first half of 2022. Due to higher household energy consumption as a result of colder temperatures, the OPEC+ production cut, the continuing war in Ukraine, and continuing sanctions on Iranian oil and gas, I think crude oil and natural gas prices will remain high for the rest of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. I expect the company to report significant third-quarter results on 27 October 2022.
