RUSSELLVILLE, Ala. (AP) — As part of an exercise to help the class learn English, a third grader pulled a block from a Jenga tower and read aloud a question written on one side. 'Where,' the boy read, then slowly sounded out the other words: 'Where would you like to visit?' 'Disneyland,' one student said. 'Space,' another classmate chimed in. 'Guatemala,' said a girl with a bright blue bow. Kathy Alfaro, a new English language teacher at Russellville Elementary, exchanged a few words with the girl in Spanish and then turned to the other students.
