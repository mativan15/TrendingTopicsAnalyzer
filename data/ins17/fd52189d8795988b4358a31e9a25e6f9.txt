If you want to know who really controls Primary Health Properties PLC (LON:PHP), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 82% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 4.2% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 31% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors.
