Published: 13:46 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 13:51 EDT, 30 May 2022 A continued explosion in the popularity of working from home is directly responsible for a 15.1 per cent of the increase in the average house prices.Analysis found that home work - which became normal for tens of millions during the pandemic  - was responsible for the majority of the 23.8 per cent increase in house prices between December 2019 and November 2021.  The shift to working remotely during the pandemic is partly responsible for driving house prices in the United States higher as people sought out larger and nicer properties to work from.
