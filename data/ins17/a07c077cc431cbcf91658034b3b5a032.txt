Baris-Ozer/iStock via Getty Images Iovance Biotherapeutics (NASDAQ:IOVA) has lost more than half of its market capitalization in the morning hours Friday, following a post-market selloff Stifel described as an overreaction to the company's trial data for melanoma candidate, lifileucel. The C-144-01 study involved patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma whose cancer advanced despite previous therapies. While the median duration of response ((mDOR)) for Cohort 2 was not reached, the registrational Cohort 4 of 87 patients indicated a median duration of response of 10.
