The European Union is considering shelling out 40 billion euros, or $39.2 billion, to help households and companies amid soaring energy inflation, Bloomberg reported.That will come out of the bloc's existing cohesion funds, with 500 billion euros originally earmarked to shield households and businesses from the energy crisis. The new measure will allow small- and medium-size firms to access financial support, and it will help fund government programs to help consumers pay their energy bills. It's expected to be important this winter, when supply shortages could deplete most of Europe's fuel storage and drum up prices, experts say.
