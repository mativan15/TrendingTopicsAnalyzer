The company owned by former President Donald Trump billed the United States Secret Service as much as five times the originally agreed-upon rate for hotel rooms while the real estate magnate was in office, according to new expense reports released to Congress.
 
According to The Washington Post, the expense reports reveal that the Trump Organization charged the Secret Service as much as $1,185 a night for agents to stay in properties such as the Trump International Hotel in D.C.
 
The reports further illustrate how, during the Trump presidency, Secret Service supervisors sought out special waivers that allowed the agency to pay far more than the government-approved nightly rate for a hotel in the D.
