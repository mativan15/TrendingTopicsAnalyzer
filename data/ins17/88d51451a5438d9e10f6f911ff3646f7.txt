Published: 23:35 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 23:42 EDT, 2 June 2022 It's a bittersweet day for billionaire James Packer after authorities finally agreed to allow his former company Crown Resorts to open its Sydney casino.The deal, made with NSW's Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) and expected to ratified by state cabinet on Monday, will allow Crown to start gaming in the huge glass Crown Towers, which preside over the city waterfront district of Barangaroo.A highly-conditional licence was agreed to by the ILGA, which, if the conditions are met and maintained for up to two years, will then turn into a regular licence.
