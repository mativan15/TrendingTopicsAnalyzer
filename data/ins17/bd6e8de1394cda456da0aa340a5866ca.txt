Chief Minister M.K. Stalin wanted the police officials to create good rapport with the public as it would greatly bring down the crimes. After presenting the awards to 64 police personnel at the medals parade held at the Rajarathinam Stadium in the city on Friday, he said the job of police officers was not only to get punishments for offenders but also to create an environment where crimes should never happen.
