A small blurb about the trade between the Browns and Atlanta Falcons came out yesterday as well. The Browns and Deion Jones have agreed to restructure his contract, eliminating the 2023 season of the deal. Jones will now hit free agency after this season.
Swapping just a sixth for a seventh rounder for an emergency plug in a leak, the Browns could essentially be renting Jones for the next 11 games of the season. However, this also keeps good faith with the player and the agent as he would not have carried any guaranteed money into 2023.
