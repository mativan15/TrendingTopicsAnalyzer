NEW YORK, Oct. 17, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Two recent studies show that the novel Optejet® dispenser from Eyenovia, Inc., an ophthalmic pharmaceutical technology company, may be a more "human-centric" design than traditional eye droppers, which may make treatments for vision problems, including myopia, presbyopia and mydriasis, easier to deliver.  The investigational Optejet® dispenser administers ophthalmic solutions horizontally using the company's proprietary Microdose Array Print (MAP™) technology.
