A father and son got a free show from a breaching whale while fishing off the Jersey Shore.
 
Doug and Zach Piller, of Bensalem Township, Penn., were in Belmar on Wednesday when the large humpback whale came up out of the water just inches in front of them, according to ABC affiliate WPVI-TV.
 
The pair were fishing on an 18-foot Starcraft built by Doug when Zach, 23, captured the incredible footage on camera, per NBC News.
 
The young fisherman later shared the "epic whale footage" on his Instagram page.
