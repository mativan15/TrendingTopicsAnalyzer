Goldman Sachs is sidelining its retail bank Marcus to focus on its more profitable arms, four years after launching savings rates in the UK.
The decision to pull back from its strategy of trying to build a consumer banking operation forms part of a major reorganisation of the business and is a significant U-turn for David Solomon, the chief executive.
The Wall Street behemoth invested significantly to build Marcus and was offering savers a far higher rate of interest for savers to deposit savings with them compared with retail rivals.
