Jack Harlow's last few music videos have been high-production events — he served as a motivational speaker and business executive in 'Nail Tech,' then made some stealthy moves through the night in 'First Class' and took over the Kentucky Derby with Drake in 'Churchill Downs.' But the newly released video for 'Like a Blade of Grass' taps in with the direct source of the rapper's star power.

Harlow's Brian Campell-helmed visual for the Come Home The Kids Miss You deep cut is an ode to his fans.
