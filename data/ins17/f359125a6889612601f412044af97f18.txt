RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday said the Gyanvapi dispute involves some issues of faith and the court's decision on it should be accepted by all, but also there was no need to find a 'Shiv Ling' in every mosque and start a new dispute every day. Addressing the concluding ceremony of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's third year officer training camp here, he said that the RSS had already made it clear that its participation in the Ayodhya agitation was an exception and it would not undertake such agitations in future.
