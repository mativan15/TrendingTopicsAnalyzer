Nino Niederreiter scored his fourth goal in four games for the Predators, who started the season with a pair of wins over San Jose in Prague.

Standout defenseman Miro Heiskanen had a goal and an assist, and Joe Pavelski added two assists for Dallas. Mason Marchment added an empty-netter to give the free-agent pickup three goals in two games.

Hintz opened the scoring with a short-handed goal when he came off the bench and poked the puck away from Roman Josi from behind. Heiskanen ended up with it and chipped a pass to Hintz for the breakaway.
