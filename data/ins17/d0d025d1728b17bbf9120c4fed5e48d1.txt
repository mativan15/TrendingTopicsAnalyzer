New York Giants wide receiver Darius Slayton is starting off his fourth NFL season hot as he has impressed during voluntary OTAs.
Slayton, a former fifth-round pick in the 2019 NFL draft, has dramatically outperformed the position of his selection so far in his career. The Auburn Tigers alum has posted 1,830 yards and 13 touchdowns through three seasons while also featuring back-to-back 700-yard seasons in 2019 and 2020.
Unfortunately, Slayton had a down year in 2021 (only 339 yards and two touchdowns) as he took a backseat in the offense with new additions Kenny Golladay and Kadarius Toney taking away from his target share.
