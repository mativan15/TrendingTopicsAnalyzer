N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) — Chad's government clamped down on the country's opposition Friday, suspending seven political parties and searching party offices a day after unprecedented protests around the country left more than 60 people dead.

Prominent opposition leader Succes Masra tweeted that the national headquarters of his Les Transformateurs party was 'being ransacked by security forces who forced their way in.'

'After having shot 70 people, arrested, wounded and tortured more than 1,000 others, they are now attacking buildings and documents,' he tweeted.
