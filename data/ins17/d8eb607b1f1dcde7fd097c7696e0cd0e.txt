By Maria Martinez The eurozone economy continued to expand at a strong rate in May as recently-relaxed pandemic restrictions supported a sustained uplift in activity levels, S&P Global said. The eurozone composite purchasing managers index fell to a four-month low of 54.8 in May from 55.8 in April. While the headline measure was still indicative of economic growth across the eurozone, it also highlighted a loss of momentum. The main driver behind the expansion was the eurozone's service sector again, as continuing supply-side disruptions, the war in Ukraine, and subdued demand for goods restrained manufacturing-output growth, S&P Global said.
