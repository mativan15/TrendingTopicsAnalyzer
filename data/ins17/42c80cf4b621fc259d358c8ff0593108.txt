In the midst of building out its West Coast maintenance, repair and overhaul facility, Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. is adding even more space near Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport.

The Savannah, Georgia-based private jet manufacturer, which is owned by General Dynamics Corp. (NYSE: GD), said it will expand by adding 59,704 square feet of new hangar space to its Mesa operations.

Gulfstream announced last November that it was investing $70 million in a new 225,000-square-foot maintenance, repair and overhaul facility, which broke ground in May and expects to be completed in 2023.
