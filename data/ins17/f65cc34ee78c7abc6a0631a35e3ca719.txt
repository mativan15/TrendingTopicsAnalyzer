Liz Truss insisted she is 'a fighter not a quitter' after Sir Keir Starmer urged her to go for having 'crashed' the economy.

The Prime Minister attempted to strike a defiant tone in the face of relentless heckling from the Opposition benches, claiming the Labour leader has 'no idea' and 'no plan'.

But Sir Keir, to cheers from his MPs, insisted Labour is a 'government in waiting' and said of the Conservatives: 'They're an Opposition in waiting.'
