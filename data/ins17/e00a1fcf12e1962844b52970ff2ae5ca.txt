FloSpine is on its way to raising $1.07 million to support the development of spinal fusion implants that can improve outcomes and shorten recovery times for patients with spine conditions.

The medical device startup kicked off an investment offering on StartEngine, an equity crowdfunding platform that counts Kevin O'Leary of 'Shark Tank' as a strategic adviser. FloSpine is developing implants that it says will enable surgeons to address 90% of spinal patient needs, with surgeries that can be completed in as little as 30 minutes.
