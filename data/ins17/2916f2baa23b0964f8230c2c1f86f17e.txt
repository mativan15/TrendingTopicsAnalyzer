I don't know about you, but I've barely recovered from May's spectacular lunar eclipse, only to learn that June's sky will feature a full supermoon. We are not worthy of your largesse, Luna, Goddess of the Full Moon.Called the 'Strawberry Moon,' June's full moon rises on Tuesday, June 14. The peak illumination of the full Strawberry Moon is actually at 7:52 a.m. ET, so we won't be able to see it, but if you look Southeast just after sunset, the supermoon will float majestically across the nighttime sky.
