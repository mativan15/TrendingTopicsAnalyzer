Voters will have the final say on a controversial law passed earlier this year.

Earlier this year, the state Legislature overrode a veto from Gov. Charlie Baker to pass a law allowing undocumented immigrants to receive Massachusetts driver's licenses starting next year.

But now voters will get the final say.

Whether or not the state should follow through the controversial law will go before the people as Question 4 on this November's ballot, following a successful GOP-backed initiative to bring the matter to voters.
