Last month the RBA raised the cash rate from a record low 0.1 per cent to 0.35 per cent - the first increase in more than a decade - and warned further hikes can be expected in coming months to curb high and rising price pressures. Economists expect an increase this month of a least another 25 basis points, or perhaps even 40 or 50 basis points this time around.
