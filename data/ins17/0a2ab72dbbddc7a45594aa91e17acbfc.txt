Erik ten Hag has been impressed by David de Gea since taking over at Manchester United but says the long-serving goalkeeper's future is on the backburner along with others approaching the end of their deals.

The 31-year-old became just the 11th player in the Old Trafford giants' history to make 500 appearances for the club when he lined up in Sunday's 0-0 Premier League draw with Newcastle.
