The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford has said Tory prime ministers since 2010 have 'collectively got us into this mess', after Kwasi Kwarteng was replaced as chancellor on Friday.

Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland on Saturday, Mr Blackford branded the situation a 'shambles' and called for a general election after Liz Truss sacked Mr Kwarteng and parachuted former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt in to Number 11 in his place.

'We've really seen the credibility for financial competence, for financial management of this Government really put to bed,' he said.
