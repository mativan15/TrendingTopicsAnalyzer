LG's new 4K monitor can pull double duty if you work from home and don't have the energy (or space) to flop over to the couch to engage in binge-watching. The $499 LG Smart Monitor (32SQ780S) (via HomeKit News) has a 31.5-inch display, a built-in USB-C hub providing power and ports for your work laptop, and comes with a desk-mounting and height adjustable Ergo Stand that's similar to the one that comes with LG's unusual taller-than-it-is-wide DualUp monitor.What makes the LG Smart Monitor more like a TV is that it supports the company's Bluetooth Magic remote (though it's unfortunately sold separately), and it runs webOS just like LG smart TVs, along with support for Apple AirPlay 2 and HomeKit.
