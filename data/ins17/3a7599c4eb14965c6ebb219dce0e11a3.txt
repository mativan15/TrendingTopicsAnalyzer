Last season, Kent Bazemore played for a Golden State Warriors team that lost in the play-in tournament and failed to reach the NBA playoffs for the second year in a row.
Believing he would have a shot at winning the world championship, he signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers last summer.

Bazemore gave his old teammates props for getting to the championship series, but he may be feeling a bit of regret for leaving them.
