MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. – Is Tua Tagovailoa coming back too soon?

After one concussion, two ugly falls replayed on social media and national air waves, three weeks of consecutive Miami Dolphins losses, and consultations with four doctors specializing in head injuries, Tagovailoa will start for the Dolphins when they host the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday Night Football.

Still, it's a natural question to ask.

Especially after Tagovailoa's recollection of the ugly scene in Cincinnati where his head hit the ground, his arms fixed above his head in a fencing response.
