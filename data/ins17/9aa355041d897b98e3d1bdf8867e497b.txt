One of Harvey Weinstein's sexual assault accusers, Ashley Judd, is speaking out on her role in the film "She Said."

"She Said," which debuts Nov. 18, highlights the work of journalists who exposed Weinstein in 2017.

Weinstein, 70, is serving a 23-year prison sentence following a conviction in New York. Weinstein, who is on trial in Los Angeles, was granted permission to take his appeal of his 2020 sex crime conviction to the New York State Court of Appeals.

Judd plays a small role in the beginning of the film, sharing her experience with Weinstein.
