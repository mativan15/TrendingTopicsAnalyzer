May 26—OXFORD — A federal judge has ordered a former Oxford police officer to pay more than $2 million to the children of a woman he killed three years ago.

In the ruling handed down Thursday, Senior U.S. District Court Judge Glen Davidson ordered Matthew Kinne to pay $1.2 million in compensatory damages and another $1 million in punitive damages to the family of Dominique Clayton. The family had asked for more than $10 million.

But the ruling and amount still pleased the family's lead attorney, Carlos Moore.
