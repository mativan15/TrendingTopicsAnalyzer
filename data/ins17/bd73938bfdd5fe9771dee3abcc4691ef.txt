The Baltimore Ravens have had multiple players go down with injuries this year that have impacted the outcomes of games. One of those players is outside linebacker Justin Houston, who coupled with the absences of Tyus Bowser and David Ojabo has created a bit of a void at the position.
On Monday, it was reported by Ian Rapoport of NFL Network that Baltimore is adding help at outside linebacker by veteran Devon Kennard to their practice squad. The former Arizona Cardinals player hasn't had much success in terms of sack production, but can be very effective in other areas that include coverage and more.
