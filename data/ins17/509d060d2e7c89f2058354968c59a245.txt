Scanners were once one of our primary methods of creating copies of documents. If you held an office job before the mid-2010's, a photocopier was likely a workplace staple. However, these devices have fallen in popularity as we've transitioned to sending digital documents.
That isn't to say that copy machines are totally obsolete. Some documents, such as passports and book pages, may require scanning technology to pull and share information quickly. But instead of holding onto antiquated tech or making a trip to the post office every time you need a quick scan, you can turn your iPhone into a photocopier with iScanner, on sale now for $40.
