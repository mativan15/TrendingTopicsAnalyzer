Japan's government has approved a cabinet decision to amend existing laws to curb money laundering using crypto, according to local news reports.

The cabinet made the decision to move forward with the changes to the country's Foreign Exchange Act and the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds on Oct. 14, Bittimes reported over the weekend.

The cabinet decision follows a Nikkei report from September that said the government is planning revisions to the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds targeting remittances in an effort to stop criminals from using crypto exchanges to launder money.
