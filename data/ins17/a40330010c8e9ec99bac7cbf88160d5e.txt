The Toyota Corolla sedan and hatchback both benefit from a number of important changes for the 2023 model year, including better safety tech and all-wheel drive for the Corolla Hybrid.
These updates -- along with changes like improved multimedia tech and some styling changes -- allow the Corolla to remain super competitive in the compact class.
The refreshed 2023 Corolla range goes on sale later this year.

The Toyota Corolla might not look all that different for 2023, but the most important updates aren't the ones you can see, they're the ones you can't.
