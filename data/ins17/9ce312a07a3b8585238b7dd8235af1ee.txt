Jun. 5—Question : During the 2020, my brother lost his new job he was to start when the mayor's order for the shutdown came. He applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and was approved. Later, he received a letter asking him to confirm his identity and proof of the job lost. When this letter was received, he tried contacting the business and, unfortunately, it had closed. Being unable to prove the lost job, his PUA benefits were stopped and he was told to repay the benefits he had received. By this time, most of his benefits had been spent.
