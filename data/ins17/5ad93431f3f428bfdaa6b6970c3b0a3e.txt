Banijay Group CEO Marco Bassetti may be making a smart marketing move by delivering a Mipcom keynote on Oct. 18, but the Italian executive insists that 'PR, for us, comes after.' At the first major TV market for the 'Survivor' distributor since its $2.2 billion acquisition of Endemol Shine Group in 2020, Bassetti has a clear message: Producers, including Banijay, need a more equitable business model against the streamers. 'It's the golden age of content, but I'm not sure it's the golden age of revenue share for producers,' Bassetti tells Variety from Banijay Group's Paris headquarters in late September.
