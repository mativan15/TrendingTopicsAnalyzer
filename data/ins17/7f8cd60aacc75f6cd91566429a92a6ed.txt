While Capcom continues the trend of bringing its classic horror games back to life, a Resident Evil Code: Veronica remake seems increasingly unlikely. Capcom producer Yoshiaki Hirabayash told NoisyPixel the team is currently focused on making Resident Evil 4 remake the best it can be.
So far, it seems Capcom's efforts in that regard are paying off. As we said in our Resident Evil 4 preview, the game's early moments are a gruesome delight and a blend of the familiar and innovative.
As for what comes later, Hirabayashi told NoisyPixel they may consider a Code: Veronica remake, if the opportunity arises.
