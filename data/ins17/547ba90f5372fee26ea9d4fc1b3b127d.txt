AgenciesThe country's coal output increased to 777 MT in 2021-22 over 716 MT in 2020-21.The government on Thursday said the drop in coal imports in FY'22 was mainly on account of the power sector's inbound shipments declining. Coal imports that had touched 248 million tonnes (MT) in FY'20 dropped continuously during the next two financial years to 215 MT in 2020-21 and 209 MT in 2021-22. "The decline in coal import during 2021-22 is largely due to decrease in import by Power Sector which came down from 45 MT in 2020-21 to 27 MT in 2021-22, decline of almost 40 per cent," the coal ministry said in a statement.
