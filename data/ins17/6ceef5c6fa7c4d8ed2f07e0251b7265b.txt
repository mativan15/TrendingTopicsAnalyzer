DEAR HARRIETTE: A friend of mine passed away recently, after asking me to handle all of her affairs.
Harriette Cole 
I quickly stepped in to help, got a lawyer and all of the other things needed to make sure she was set. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, her former partner came to me asking for money. He said he had bought a house with her years before, and he claimed that she owed him money.
This transaction was something I knew nothing about. There were no records of it, either. He couldn't show me anything, certainly no legal documentation of the loan he said he gave her.
