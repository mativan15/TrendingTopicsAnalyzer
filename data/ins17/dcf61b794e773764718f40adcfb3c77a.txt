"There is a deliberate attempt' by the Centre in withholding Rs 97,000 crore due to Bengal and they are 'politicising the entire issue", TMC alleged.West Bengal's ruling Trinamool Congress alleged that the union government was playing politics over central funds and because chief minister Mamata Banerjee was the main face of the opposition, it was not releasing money to her state. Senior Bengal minister Chandrima Bhattacharya told ET that the state had a major focus on social welfare schemes for women and their empowerment, and this helped boost employment among its women.
