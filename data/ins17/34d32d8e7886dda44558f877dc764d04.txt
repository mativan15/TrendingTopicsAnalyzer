Claudia Jordan, who starred on Deal or No Deal alongside Meghan Markle, has hit back at claims that she was ‘objectified' and ‘reduced to a bimbo' on the show.
Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and Real Housewives of Atlanta star Claudia both modelled on the show during the mid-2000s, holding up briefcases as part of the game.
Meghan, 41, recently reflected on her experience and said she was ‘grateful' for the opportunity on Deal or No Deal back in 2006 but she was ‘treated like a bimbo'.
Claudia, 49, has shared a different take, insisting that the pair were offered ‘so many opportunities' after appearing on the gameshow.
