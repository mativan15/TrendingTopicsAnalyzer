Jun. 3—John Burlew will be the next Daviess County attorney.

Burlew, a Republican, expected to face Democrat Nick Goetz in November's primary election. But Goetz has formally withdrawn from the race, leaving Burlew to claim the seat uncontested. Daviess County Attorney Claud Porter didn't seek reelection.

Goetz said that while he has enjoyed campaigning for office, he decided that he needed to prioritize his private practice.

"After careful consideration and lengthy discussions with my family, I have decided to withdraw from the race for Daviess County attorney in order to focus on the growing needs of my private practice," he said.
