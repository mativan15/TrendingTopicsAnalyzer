SpaceX boss Elon Musk has come under fire after the company said it could stop funding the Ukrainian military's access to the Starlink satellite system, despite recently being valued at around $125 billion.Around 20,000 Starlink satellite units have been donated to Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February, playing an important role in battlefield communication for Kyiv's forces. On Friday, Musk said the operation had cost SpaceX $80 million, adding it will "exceed $100M by end of year."On Wednesday Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov described Starlink as an "essential part of crucial infrastructure" for his country.
