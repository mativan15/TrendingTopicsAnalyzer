A mum was scammed out of more than £2,500 by a conman who pretended to be her daughter.
Sheelagh Stewart received a message from someone claiming to be her 22-year-old daughter Beth.
The scammer said she had to use a temporary phone after dropping hers down the toilet.
The 65-year-old then received a panicked text from ‘Beth' explaining her online banking had been frozen for 48 hours due to a security breach, and she had an urgent invoice of £1390.45 to pay.
Believing her daughter was in desperate need, Sheelagh, from West Lothian, transferred the cash to account details provided.
