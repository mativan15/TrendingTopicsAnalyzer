A slew of bullish calls on Netflix Inc. from 'back on track' to 'rise of a new version' by Wall Street brokers confirm that a change in tact and rebound in user growth are likely to set the stock off to a sustainable recovery.

Shares in the video streaming giant surged 14% Wednesday, set for its biggest jump since January 2021. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG and KGI Securities Co Ltd upgraded their recommendations on the stock, while at least a dozen other analysts boosted their target price.
