Ralph Hasenhüttl lives to fight another day as Southampton manager. It was not pretty, and was far from the complete performance, but nobody could accuse his players of not fighting for him as they ground out a precious victory thanks to Ché Adams's early goal.It may prove a temporary reprieve for the Austrian but four points from two games following a dismal run at least gives him hope. At the final whistle, he went on to the pitch and congratulated his players individually, before joining them in front of the travelling support.
