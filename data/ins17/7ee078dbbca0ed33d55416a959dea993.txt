AgenciesThis move will be a relief for manufacturers of agricultural machinery such as tractors, power tillers and combined harvesters.In a boost to tractor and other agricultural equipment manufacturers, the Transport Ministry has deferred the implementation of stricter emission norms by another six months.

Officials say that this led to consultations within the government which concluded that the global chip shortage, among other factors, is going to hamper the implementation of these norms.
