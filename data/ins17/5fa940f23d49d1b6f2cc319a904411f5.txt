Drew Barrymore is addressing accusations that she "hates sex" after recent comments she made about the relative unimportance of sex in her life at this time.

In a new blog post, the 47-year-old shared that she has had no issue abstaining from sex "for years." The piece was published in response to a woman who accused her of "hating sex," with Barrymore writing that her feelings about intimacy have evolved over the years.

"I have very different feelings about intimacy than I did growing up," the former child star writes.
