Bush singer, Gavin Rossdale, 56, on the chaotic Woodstock '99 festival, daughter Daisy Lowe's engagement, being Tom Jones's and David Bowie's buddy and a mammoth tour of the US as music still grabs him. 
It's 30 years since you first formed the rock band Bush. How's the North American tour been with Alice In Chains and Breaking Benjamin?
I spend 23 hours going, ‘I can't believe we're doing this, this tour is too long.' And then you do the show and it's really good fun and you're like, ‘This is great!' 
The venues are really beautiful.
