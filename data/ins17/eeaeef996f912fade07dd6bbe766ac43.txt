Home is where the heart is, and the money, if inflationary trends don't cool. That's according to the latest Deutsche Bank survey of investors, who say that property will be their most preferred buy-and-hold asset class, if inflation stays elevated — averaging between 3% and 5% over the next decade. 'In spite of soaring across the world during the pandemic, property is the preferred store of value in an inflationary environment, while equities outstripped gold despite the latter's huge outperformance during the inflationary 1970s,' said Jim Reid, head of thematic research, and strategist Tim Wessel, in the survey released on Monday.
