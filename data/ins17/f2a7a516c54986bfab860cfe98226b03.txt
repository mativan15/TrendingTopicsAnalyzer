With a heritage that goes back to the fabled times of 2000 A.D. (since when it has backed 160 European teams) Paris-based early stage fund Alven, has something of a reputation to keep up. After investing in unicorns such as Qonto, Dataiku, Algolia, Stripe and Ankorstore, it now has €2B in assets under management.
But that was yesterday. And today it's coming out with its sixth fund, having hit a hard cap of €350M after exceeding the initial target of €300M, making it one of the largest early stage funds operating out of France.
