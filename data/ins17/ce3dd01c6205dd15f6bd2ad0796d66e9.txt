Coup, assassination, abdication, suicide and illness – all have contributed to history's shortest serving leaderships though none, in the literal sense at least, can be said to apply to Liz Truss.But at just 45 days, she faces the ignominy of being the UK's shortest-serving prime minister by some degree.As she becomes an indelible footnote in British history, it will be little comfort to Truss that, compared to some, she has enjoyed positive political longevity.The Tory statesman George Canning had, until Thursday, the distinction of holding the UK record, serving 119 days in office before dying of tuberculosis on 8 August 1827.
