A townhouse is defined as a tall, narrow, urban home on multiple levels, with properties on one, or both, sides. This waterside property, with its ice blue and white facade, stands tall on a gated marina. The living room is on the ground floor with bifold doors that open on to a marina-side terrace. The main bedroom, with an en suite bathroom and a south-facing balcony, is on the first floor. The top level has three bedrooms and a bathroom. It is near the Shack seafood restaurant and National Maritime Museum, and a short walk to the town centre.
