Aviation bosses were on Tuesday told to 'get a grip' to avoid holiday getaway misery hitting millions of Britons this summer. The Government and MPs piled pressure on airline bosses to act swiftly to end cancellations and delays currently blighting breaks for thousands of families.Passengers also pleaded for moves to tackle lengthy queues at some airports amid fears that the delays will hit flights during the Platinum Jubilee four-day bank holiday weekend and spill over into the summer months.The chaos for tens of thousands of travellers is believed to be partly down to a 'perfect storm' of staff shortages, computer problems, air traffic problems and a bigger than expected surge in demand after the Covid crisis.
