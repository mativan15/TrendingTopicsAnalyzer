WASHINGTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Masazumi Wakatabe said on Saturday the yen's recent fluctuations were "clearly too rapid and too one-sided."

In a seminar, Wakatabe also said the government has made clear there was no discrepancy or inconsistency between its efforts to tame excessive yen declines, and the BOJ's ultra-easy monetary policy aimed at achieving its 2% inflation target. (Reporting by Leika Kihara; editing by Diane Craft)
