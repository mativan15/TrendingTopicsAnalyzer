Former Tory minister Lord Agnew has launched a public attack on Starling Bank, dragging the online lender into the Covid loans scandal by claiming it did not run adequate checks on borrowers before handing out taxpayer-backed loans. During the pandemic, the UK government relied on high street and online banks to hand out £47bn to small businesses under the bounce back loan scheme, which offered up to £50,000 per company. The Treasury promised to cover 100% of the losses if borrowers failed to repay.
