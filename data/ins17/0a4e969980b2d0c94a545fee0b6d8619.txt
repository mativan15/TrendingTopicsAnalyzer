Boarding1Now In a previous report, I marked Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) as two companies that have strong management execution. However, after a steep selloff on the markets which was extra harsh on airlines, neither of the two companies has shown market outperformance. In fact, Alaska Airlines shares are tanking today, trading 5% lower despite beating expectations. In this report, I will assess the company's Q3 2022 results and I will mostly be looking for what part of the earnings is causing shares to sell off despite the stock market being in positive territory today.
