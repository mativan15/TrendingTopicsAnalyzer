TOKYO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Thursday the government will continue to take appropriate steps against excessive currency market volatility.

"We absolutely cannot tolerate excessively volatile moves driven by speculative trading," Suzuki told parliament, speaking in the wake of the yen's slide to a fresh 32-year low against the dollar to 149.91 in overnight trading. The greenback stood around 149.84 in early Asia trading on Thursday.
