Lewis Capaldi's mum had no qualms with pointing out her son's almighty wardrobe blunder during a recent TV appearance, and we absolutely love her for it.
On Friday October 21, the singer appeared on Scottish TV channel STV, having recently announced he's heading on a brand new tour in the new year.
During his interview, the 26-year-old chatted about topics including Davina McCall and the recent release of his song Forget Me, the music video for which took inspiration from Wham!'s Club Tropicana.
However, after watching her son on TV, Lewis' mum couldn't help but point out his unmistakeable ‘mangina', due to the way his trousers looked on the screen while he was sitting down.
