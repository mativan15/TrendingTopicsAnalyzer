So you have $2,000 (or $500 or $25,000) burning a hole in your pocket, and want to buy some stocks? That's great! First, be sure that you're ready to invest -- meaning that you're not saddled with high-interest rate debt (such as credit cards) and that you'll be investing money that you won't need for at least five years.
You should also have a decent understanding of how (and why) to invest in stocks. Once you do, you can start thinking about whether you want to opt for a simple index fund or two or if you want to carefully choose some individual stocks.
