Organizers of the Exotics on Las Olas car show have switched locations for its 5th annual event.

For the past four years, the event had taken place on Las Olas in Fort Lauderdale. But the Nov. 13 show is now known as the Exotics at the Pointe as it has moved to downtown Dania Pointe in Dania Beach.

"We chose to move as the new location provides a variety of options for dining, entertainment and event parking," said organizer Floyd Rag, co-founder ofSupercar Saturdays Florida. "We were maxed out at Exotics on Las Olas, so we couldn't have any more cars there.
