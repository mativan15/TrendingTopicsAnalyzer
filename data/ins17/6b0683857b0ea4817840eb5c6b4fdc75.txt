The Washington Wizards start their season at Gainbridge FieldHouse to face the Indiana Pacers. Tipoff is at 7 p.m. ET. Below, we analyze Tipico Sportsbook's lines around the Wizards vs. Pacers odds, and our expert NBA picks and predictions.
The Wizards began last season 10-3 before immediately imploding. In February, they were sellers at the trade deadline, but did acquire F Kristaps Porzingis. Wizards fans didn't really get to see how G Bradley Beal would play with Porzingis due to injuries. Will the Wizards enjoy the same good fortune that last season started with? Or how it ended?
The Pacers are rebuilding and possibly tanking even further for the draft.
