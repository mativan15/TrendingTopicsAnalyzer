A 32-year-old southern Minnesota man said he fatally shot his roommate because one of them in the house had to die by midnight, according to a criminal complaint filed Wednesday. Cody V. Kolstad, of Morristown, was charged in Rice County District Court with second-degree intentional murder in connection with the death of Brian D. Stoeckel, 41, early Tuesday at their house in the 100 block of SE. 2nd Street in Morristown. Kolstad remains jailed ahead of a bail hearing Thursday. Court records do not yet list an attorney for him.
