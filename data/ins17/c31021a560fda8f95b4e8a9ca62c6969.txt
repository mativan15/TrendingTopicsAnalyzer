BMW unveiled the third generation of its X1 subcompact crossover on Tuesday. While the smallest SUV in the company's lineup got a slight refresh in 2020, this 2023 model promises more power and tech with a revised interior and a starting price under $40,000.The new X1 is 1.7 inches longer than its predecessor with a wheelbase that's longer by nearly 1 inch. Overall width increases by 0.9 inches and it's 1.7 inches taller, too. That translates to more interior space and a stronger presence on the road.
