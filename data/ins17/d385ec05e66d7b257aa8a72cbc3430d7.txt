Prime minister Liz Truss was today accused of 'hiding away' from scrutiny after she dodged questions in the House of Commons, sending Penny Mordaunt in her place.There was loud and derisive laughter from Labour benches as Ms Mordaunt told MPs that the prime minister could not turn up to answer an urgent question on the economic crisis resulting from her botched mini-Budget because she was 'detained on urgent business'.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that Ms Truss should be showing leadership at this time, but told MPs: 'The lady's not for turning up.
