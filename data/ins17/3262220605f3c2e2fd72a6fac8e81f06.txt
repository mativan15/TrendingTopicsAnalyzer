Oct. 20—Frederick County Public Schools students in 10th and 11th grade can apply until Nov. 4 to be the student member of the Frederick County Board of Education.

Lucas Tessarollo, a Gov. Thomas Johnson High School senior, is the current student member. The next one will begin in that position in July.

The student member doesn't vote, but is responsible for representing a student's perspective on the board. The student communicates with other board members about student priorities and communicates with students about the board's decisions.
