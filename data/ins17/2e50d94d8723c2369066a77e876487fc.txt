Oct. 16—POTSDAM — After a debate on Tuesday night, town councilors decided to stick with giving themselves a raise in the 2023 budget.

The board that evening also passed a preliminary second draft of the coming year's spending plan, and set a public hearing for what will be a final budget vote at 6:30 p.m. Nov. 10, prior to the start of the regular monthly meeting. It will take place at the Potsdam Town Hall, 18 Elm St.

The current draft of the budget increases annual pay for the four town councilors to $21,000 in 2023 from $19,460 in the 2022 budget.
