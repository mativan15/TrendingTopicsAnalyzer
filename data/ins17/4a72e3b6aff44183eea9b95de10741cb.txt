Georgia-Pacific announced Monday it has closed its Oshkosh packaging facility.

The closing of the facility, 413 E. Murdock Ave., will result in 38 people being laid off.

"All positions at the facility are being eliminated as a result of the closure," said company executive Rachel Ryan in a letter to the Wisconsin Department of Workplace Development.

Most of the layoffs are effective Monday, but Ryan said some employees may remain past Monday to assist with the facility shutdown.

Employees will receive 60 days' pay with benefits, which is in accordance with federal and state law.
