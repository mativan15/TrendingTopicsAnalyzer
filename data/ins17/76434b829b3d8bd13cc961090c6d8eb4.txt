"The notice to evict from Fair View was served to me a few days ago. This has not come as a surprise and is along the expected lines," the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister told PTI. She said although the notice mentions that the bungalow is meant for the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, that is not the case.
