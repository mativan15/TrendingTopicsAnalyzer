TOKYO, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The dollar hung close to a 32-year peak versus the yen on Wednesday while edging up from a two-week trough against a basket of major peers as traders weighed improved risk sentiment against the prospect of aggressive Federal Reserve rate hikes.

Sterling consolidated in the middle of its trading range this week as the market digested the British government's fiscal policy reversal and the Bank of England's decision not to sell any longer-duration gilts this year.
