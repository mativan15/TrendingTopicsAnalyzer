After a challenging period for law enforcement in this country, police are gathering in the sunshine city this weekend to help a cause near and dear to their hearts. The Law Enforcement Torch Run is set to take place on Sunday. Police from across the province will be participating, along with the general public, to help bring in critical funds for Special Olympics Ontario. "It can be a tough profession. Obviously, over the last few weeks, we've seen that," says Derek Spence, a retired police officer who is chairing this year's run.
