Kicking off the summer recruiting scene with their ChampU Family BBQ, the Oklahoma Sooners are hoping to make a lasting impression on the 2023 class ahead of their senior year of high school.

While not every kid will want to make a commitment this summer, many will want to get it out of the way before they play their final year of high school ball so it's not lingering over their head. They've spent this week hosting Brent Venables first football camp as the head coach of the Oklahoma Sooners and now they're in the midst of hosting a number of players in Norman for the ChampU event.
