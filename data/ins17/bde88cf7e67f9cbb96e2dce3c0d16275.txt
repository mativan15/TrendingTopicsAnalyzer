Bertuzzi left Sunday's win over the New Jersey Devils on Sunday after a puck smacked his right hand. The Red Wings did not disclose the full nature of the injury, referring only to an upper-body injury as the reason for his absence. Bertuzzi had an assist at 1:30 of the second period before he was hurt while blocking a shot.
