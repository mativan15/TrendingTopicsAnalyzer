There are few things better than passive income. Getting paid month after month and year after year without having to work for it is a pretty magical thing. One of my favorite ways to earn passive income is by investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs). 
REITs are some of the best dividend stocks because their structure requires them to pay 90% or more of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends. This leads to higher dividend returns, more consistent payouts, and the bonus of diversification into real estate.
