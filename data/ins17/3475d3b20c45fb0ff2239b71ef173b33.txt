By Australian Associated Press Published: 21:00 EDT, 15 October 2022 | Updated: 22:25 EDT, 15 October 2022 Thousands of NSW teachers will be shifted from temporary to permanent positions under pledges simultaneously announced by the state government and opposition. The two major parties on Sunday accused each other of copying the policy as both promised to move 10,000 staff into ongoing roles to fix shortages ahead of the March state election. The government said temporary teachers and support staff in areas of need would be offered permanent positions to bolster classroom numbers.
