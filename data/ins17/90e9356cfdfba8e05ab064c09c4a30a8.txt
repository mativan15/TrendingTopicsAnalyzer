Ezekiel Elliott is entering his seventh season with the Cowboys. An eighth is not guaranteed.

That's because the running back has no guaranteed money remaining after this season. It seems likely the Cowboys won't pay him $10.9 million in base salary and take a $16.72 million cap charge for Elliott in 2023.

So, this could be his last season in Dallas.

Elliott needs a big year personally after falling out of the conversation as one of the league's best backs the past two seasons.
