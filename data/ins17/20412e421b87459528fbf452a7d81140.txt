A TIKTOKER has gone viral after revealing how he covers up his hair loss with a simple trick – and social media users can't believe the 'catfish' transformation.
Paul, a sandwich maker from Lima, Peru, first started noticing his thick, glossy locks falling out unexpectedly 14 years ago and struggled to cope with his new reality.

He believes the "difficult" ordeal is due to genetics, as his dad and grandparents also used to have "beautiful and thick" hair, which soon started to disappear.
