Sir Keir Starmer will accuse Liz Truss of 'insulting' British workers while pledging a Labour government will repeal any new Conservative legislation restricting the right to strike.In his address to the annual TUC conference on Thursday, the Labour leader will say the Tories are 'completely out of touch with the reality of the British economy'.He will highlight a leaked audio recording of Ms Truss when she was treasury chief secretary under Theresa May saying workers in the UK lacked the 'skill and application' of their foreign counterparts and needed 'a bit more graft'.
