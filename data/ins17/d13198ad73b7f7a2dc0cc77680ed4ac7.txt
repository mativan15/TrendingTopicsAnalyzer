Remarks as Delivered I was supposed to say good afternoon, but I have ten minutes to spare here, so good morning. Just now, Minister Buschmann and I met to reaffirm the importance of the law enforcement partnership between our two countries. During our meeting, we discussed the necessity of robust cooperation between the United States Department of Justice and the German Ministry of Justice in countering a wide range of threats to the security of both of our countries and to the Rule of Law. That includes the threat posed by Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.
