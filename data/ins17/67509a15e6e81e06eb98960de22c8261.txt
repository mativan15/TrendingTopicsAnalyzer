Photo: Al Drago/Bloomberg News Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell listed holdings largely made up of stock funds and local government debt in his financial disclosure statement for 2021. Mr. Powell's disclosure doesn't show any transactions in individual stocks or other securities. His form lists a number of transactions in funds for municipal debt securities as well funds that hold collections of stocks. Some of Mr. Powell's transactions don't have trade dates listed, but a Fed spokesperson said those transactions are tied to automatic reinvestments, a practice permitted by the government ethics office.
