A London council has waded into the debate over free school meals by writing to the Government calling for the eligibility threshold for children in secondary school to be almost tripled — from £7,400 to £20,000 a year.A letter to Kit Malthouse, Secretary of State for Education, calls on him to 'act now to avert a calamitous hunger crisis' by initiating universal provision of free healthy, school meals for all primary school children, as well as raising the income threshold for all secondary school pupils.
