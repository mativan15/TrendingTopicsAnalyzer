CLEVELAND — Aaron Judge is out of the leadoff spot for Game 3 of the ALDS. 
The slugger was moved to the No. 2 spot on Saturday against the Guardians, with Gleyber Torres moving to the top of the lineup. 
The switch came after two straight subpar games from Judge, who went hitless in the first two games, with seven strikeouts.

Judge hasn't been alone in his early struggles in the postseason, as the Yankees had just 11 hits in the first two games. The slugger was booed by Yankees fans during Game 2.
