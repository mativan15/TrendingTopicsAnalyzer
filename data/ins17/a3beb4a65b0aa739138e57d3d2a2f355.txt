The price of a pint of beer and glass of wine is set to increase after the new chancellor scrapped the freeze on alcohol duty.

Jeremy Hunt tore up beleaguered prime minister Liz Truss's economic plan on Monday in an effort to ease the worries of the financial markets.

The chancellor, only in the job since Friday after Truss sacked Kwasi Kwarteng, reversed almost all the tax cutting policies announced in last month's disastrous mini-budget.
