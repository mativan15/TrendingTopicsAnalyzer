When I was younger I wanted to be a doctor. I loved school and learning and my parents noticed that I was intelligent from an early age. I remember in the third or fourth grade, we took a plane trip somewhere and during the flight I memorized the periodic table for fun.But when I reached sixth grade, I had one teacher who really made me lose interest in school. This guy was just super absent; he went to class and did as little as possible. I became more focused on the social environment rather than learning and paying attention to the teacher.
