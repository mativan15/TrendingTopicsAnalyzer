Roberto Wirth was the owner and manager of Rome's famed Hotel Hassler, one of the world's few grand hotels still in private hands. Superbly sited at the top of the Spanish Steps, it has played host to everyone from Charlie Chaplin and Pablo Picasso to Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.Wirth's achievements, though not as noteworthy as theirs, were nevertheless remarkable. Born profoundly deaf, he had numerous barriers to success to overcome in a business in which communication is fundamental.Many Italians still stigmatise disability, perhaps as a folk memory of the days when it was viewed as a mark of divine disfavour or of the malice of an evildoer.
