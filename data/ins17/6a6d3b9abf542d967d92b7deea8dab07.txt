Yaounde, Cameroon — 
Cameroon's military said several soldiers have been arrested for torturing a suspected separatist general and fighters, following deadly fighting in the northwestern village of Djotin.
Army Captain and military spokesman Cyrille Serge Atonfack Guemo said in a statement that the government troops in question committed gross human rights violations and crimes, which give Cameroon's military a bad image.
The military said during an operation to free civilians abducted by fighters, troops killed at least a dozen rebels and arrested and tortured several others.
