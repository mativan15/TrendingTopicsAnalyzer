JPMorgan has released its monthly list of analysts' top picks, and there's one addition. Auto auction platform ACV Auctions was added to the list as a growth pick. The firm didn't outline any stocks that were removed from the list, which is compiled each month by analysts from its top stock picks. All of the stocks in the bank's Analyst Focus List have overweight ratings and are recommended for growth or value strategies, with the exception of one near-term term pick: Bank of America . Analyst Vivek Juneja called out the bank for its sensitivity to rising rates.
