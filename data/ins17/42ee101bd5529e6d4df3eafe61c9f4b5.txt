When a clip of the Cardinal Divas, a majorette dance team at the University of Southern California — Los Angeles, went viral last month, the group's founder, Princess Isis Lang, said she didn't expect her life to dramatically change.

'Honestly, my life has been so crazy,' said Lang, 20, who is studying musical theater at USC. 'Some people have come up to me and they're like, ‘Oh my gosh, are you Princess? Are you that girl that created that majorette team?''

'I'm really blessed. And I can only really thank God and my friends and family,' she added.
