Capital Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ: CBNK) wants to more than double its asset size and it's aiming to do so by converting more of its subprime credit card customers into traditional borrowers, building out its technology tools and perhaps making an acquisition or two.

Over the last couple of years, the parent of Rockville-based Capital Bank has seen triple-digit growth in the number of consumers using its OpenSky secured credit card, to about 500,000 nationwide, said CEO Ed Barry. These cards require consumers to pay an up front, refundable deposit that they can then borrow against, and Barry sees significant opportunity in helping them repair their blemished credit and eventually graduate into products like car loans and mortgages.
