EY is planning to spin off its audit business, working towards the biggest shake-up of one of the UK's 'big four' accounting and consultancy firms in decades after a series of high-profile corporate collapses including Carillion and BHS.Senior partners at the firm – formerly known as Ernst & Young – are drafting plans for a voluntary split of the firm's advisory and audit divisions, which was first reported by Michael West Media.The move comes after a spate of accounting scandals and company failures, and pressure for a major overhaul of the sector to tackle potential conflicts of interest at the big four accountancy groups – EY, KPMG, PwC and Deloitte.
