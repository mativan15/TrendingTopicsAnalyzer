The Ministry for Primary Industries is investigating after photos and video emerged of stock being hit while being loaded on to a live export ship at Port Taranaki. Advocacy group Taranaki Animal Save took the footage of the animals, which were being collected by livestock carrier the Ocean Ute last week. New Zealand exports live cattle to China in efforts to help the country build up its own herd. Last year nearly 135,000 cattle were exported there. Group spokesperson Elin Arbez said what they saw last week was disturbing.
