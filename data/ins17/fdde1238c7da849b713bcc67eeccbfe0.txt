GNC has a new office address for its world headquarters and made its new home official with a ribbon cutting celebration on rainy June afternoon.

'Today is obviously a milestone for GNC as we open this new office,' said Josh Burris, CEO of the nutritional supplements retailer, who will also be speaking at the Business Times' VisionPittsburgh event next Wednesday.

The company moved from its long-time office on Wood Street downtown to 75,000 square feet in the top three floors of 75 Hopper Place, a new office building by Oxford Development Co.
