By Kyle Morris Eve Sleep PLC said Monday that it is starting a review to look at strategic and financing options, including a possible sale of the company, and that it no longer expects to achieve its previous full-year revenue expectations. The London-listed sleep-wellness brand said the board thinks that it would benefit from further investment and that it has entered a formal sale process, as defined in the U.K. Takeover Code. There can be no certainty any offer will be forthcoming nor the terms of any such offer, it said.
