Markets regulator Sebi has given its nod for the proposed initial public offerings of four companies -- BIBA Fashions Ltd, Keystone Realtors Ltd, Plaza Wires Ltd and Hemani Industries Ltd. These companies have received their respective observation letters from Sebi, according to an update on the regulator's website as on October 14. In Sebi's parlance, issuance of the observation letter implies the go-ahead from the regulator for the proposed IPO. Ethnic wear fashion label Biba Fashion, which is backed by Warburg Pincus and Faering Capital, had filed the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) for an IPO in April.
