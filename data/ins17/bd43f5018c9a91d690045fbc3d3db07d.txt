Rich countries must urgently develop a plan to assist countries suffering the ravages of extreme weather, as failure to take early action on the climate crisis has left them increasingly vulnerable, developing nations have said.The V20 – made up of the 20 vulnerable countries facing the worst impacts of the climate crisis, and least able to cope with them – set out its proposals on Monday for how rich countries should pay for the 'loss and damage' caused by the climate crisis.Its demands are likely to be a key issue at the Cop27 UN climate summit, which starts in Egypt on 6 November.
