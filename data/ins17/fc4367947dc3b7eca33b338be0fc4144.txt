THE BOMBAY High Court on Thursday dismissed over 100 petitions by realtors, who are developing projects on lands or properties of state government, Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) or BMC lands/properties and sought exemptions from levy, imposition, demand and recovery of development charges by BMC under Section 124F of the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning (MRTP) Act, 1966.
The developers claimed that such recoveries were illegal and contrary to the law. The exemption sought was to the tune of Rs 800 crore.
