A popular supe from hit Prime Video series The Boys looks set to return for the series four despite their apparent death at the end of season 3.
Pictures posted to Twitter appear to show filming for the eagerly-anticipated season taking place, with Black Noir, played by Nathan Mitchell, in costume.
The character is seen standing with a number of other superheroes in an unknown location, which could suggest the popular character is making a return to the show.
Black Noir was killed at the end of series 3 by Homelander after he finds out he helped to hide the identity of his father, Soldier Boy.
