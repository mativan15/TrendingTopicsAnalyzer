Dr Disrespect's gaming studio has taken up a partnership with the Ethereum based company Polygon Studios for a new game. 
The world of cryptocurrency and the blockchain is horrendously complex, and hideously stupid. However, despite the constant crashes in value and scams that plague the entirety of Web3, it seems to be soldiering on. 
Dr Disrespect has been working on a game with his studio, Midnight Society, but there's never been any real information on what it is. What we now know, with this partnership with Polygon Studios, is that it'll feature a blockchain-based item and trading system.
