The stock market is unlikely to stage a complete rebound later this year as inflation remains high, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said.When asked on Bloomberg TV late Thursday if markets can recoup losses in the second half of the year, he replied, "probably not — not totally." He noted that markets are recalibrating to tighter monetary policy, with growths stocks seeing most of the downside. Meanwhile, soaring energy and commodity stocks are masking some of the weakness on indexes, he added. "So if you look at the volatility in the market and the spread between winners and losers, it's pretty broad this year," Fink said.
