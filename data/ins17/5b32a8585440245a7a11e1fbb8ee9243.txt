"It's the lack of r's for me 😂"

A woman astonished her dad with some exciting news — she's running the Boston Marathon next year.

In a viral TikTok, Bridget Lawler called her 'very Boston' father, Joseph Lawler, to ask if he had any plans for April 17.

'Pay tax bills,' he responds, before his daughter offers him something else to add to his calendar: 'Would you like to come watch me run the Boston Marathon?'

Joseph's stunned reaction gained the video over 80,000 likes, with nods from Marathon officials and sportswear brands alike.
