If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) share price is up 39% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. In stark contrast, the stock price has actually fallen 5.4% in the last year.

With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
