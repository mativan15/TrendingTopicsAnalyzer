An Oscar-winning actress has slammed The Crown for "crude sensationalism" as she claims the Netflix show is "cruelly unjust". Dame Judi Dench, who was an actress in the James Bond films, called on Netflix to insert a disclaimer at the start of the programme to say it is a "fictionalised drama" in a letter to The Times. It comes as the hit-Netflix show is set to return on November 9 for an explosive season which will see the breakdown of Princess Diana and Charles' marriage on screen. Ms Dench, 87, said adding in the disclaimer would not only be a mark of respect for the late Queen, but would also help to preserve Netflix's reputation.
