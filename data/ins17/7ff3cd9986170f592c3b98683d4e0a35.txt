TAIPEI (Reuters) -Foxconn the world's largest contract electronics maker, said on Tuesday it wanted its customers to sell electric vehicles (EVs) in large numbers, produced in Taiwan, Thailand and the United States and possibly in the future also in India and Indonesia.

The ambition lines up with Taiwan-based Foxconn's plans to ramp up EV business to help diversify away from its role of assembling consumer gadgets like iPhones for Apple Inc and other tech firms.
