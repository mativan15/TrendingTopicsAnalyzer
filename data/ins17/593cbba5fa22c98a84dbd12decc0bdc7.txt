Standing before some 2,300 Chinese Communist Party elite members and giving a nearly two-hour long speech at the opening of the Party Congress, China's President Xi Jinping looked in full control, at the helm of a giant nation growing ever more powerful economically and geopolitically.
But applause aside, Xi knows he faces many critics from within his party and without.
A rules-breaker the likes of which China has not seen in recent decades, Xi has ruffled many feathers, to say the least. 
He has rewritten the constitution to end term limits, jailed members of the top echelon of power and punished hundreds of thousands of other lower ranking officials in his wide-ranging corruption campaign, and put the military firmly under the control of the party.
