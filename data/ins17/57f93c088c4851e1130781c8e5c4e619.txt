Joseph Kosinski is flying high off the success of 'Top Gun: Maverick,' which debuted to a record-breaking $160 million over the Memorial Day weekend frame. The sequel is the first bonafide box office success for the director, who started his feature directorial career with Disney's 'Tron: Legacy.' That sequel earned $400 million worldwide, but that sum wasn't enough for Disney to allow Kosinski to pursue an intended sequel under the title 'Tron: Ascension.'
In a new interview with Vulture, Kosinski confirmed he had storyboarded and written the entire third 'Tron' movie when Disney pulled the plug on the project in 2015.
