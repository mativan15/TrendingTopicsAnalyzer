Saturday morning, aerospace company Blue Origin is slated to conduct its fifth tourist flight, sending a crew of six to the edge of space and back out of West Texas. Once again, it's a flight without any major celebrities on board, as the company transitions into making these quick jaunts to space relatively routine.
The flight, called NS-21, comes just two months after Blue Origin's last tourist trip on March 31st. That mission sent up five paying customers and one company employee — the first time no big names flew.
