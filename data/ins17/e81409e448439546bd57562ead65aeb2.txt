Puppy farmers who sold sick and dying dogs and even kept dead spaniels in a freezer have been jailed. 
The gang made £850,000 and advertised dogs as ‘bred at home' despite being sourced from puppy farms in Swindon and Wales. 
Police seized nine puppies kept in a shed at a property in Essex, one of which died after contracting the fatal parvovirus in the squalid conditions.
Two miles away the bodies of two adult spaniels, six cocker spaniel puppies and two dead spaniel puppies were found stuffed in a freezer.
