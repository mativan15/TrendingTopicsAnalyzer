The Enterprise Center has paid $12.5 million for a stretch of land it will look to develop in West Philadelphia, part of a broader effort by the nonprofit aimed at revitalizing the area in and around the 52nd Street commercial spine.

The 2.9-acre parcel is on the south side of Market Street from the corner of 46th Street to the Community College of Philadelphia's new building at the corner of 48th Street. Enterprise Center CEO Della Clark didn't want to get specific on details as a master plan is still being drawn up for the project but said to expect 'something very transformative' on the site.
