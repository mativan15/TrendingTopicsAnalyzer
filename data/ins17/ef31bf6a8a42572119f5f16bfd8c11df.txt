RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Cheri Beasley saw her fundraising advantage over Republican rival Ted Budd widen during the past three months and entering the campaign's final weeks.

Budd's campaign reported over the weekend — on the Federal Election Commission's deadline date — that it raised $4.77 million during the three months ending Sept. 30. That's barely one-third the $13.36 million that Beasley told the FEC that she raised — in keeping with what her campaign already had disclosed last week.
