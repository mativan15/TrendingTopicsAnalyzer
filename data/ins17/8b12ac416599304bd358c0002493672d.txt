Republican nominee Doug Mastriano told Erie-area supporters he would create an economic "renaissance" in the state, drastically reduce regulations on his first day in office, ban abortion with no exceptions from the point of conception, and address a range of other culture war issues if he's elected governor on Nov. 8.

"We're going to shock all the prognosticators in politics and all of those commenting on how things should be run, and can be run. We're going to take our state back by storm," said Mastriano, 58.
