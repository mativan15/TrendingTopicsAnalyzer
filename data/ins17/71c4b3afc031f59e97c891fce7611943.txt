Liverpool can bring 100 up and further extend their impressive Anfield record when they host West Ham on Wednesday evening.

The Reds' next goal will be their 100th against West Ham in the Premier League.

If there are three goals in tonight's game, that will bring the total amount in all Premier League meetings to 150.

September's goalless draw at Everton was the one and only time Liverpool have failed to score in the Premier League in 2022.

Going into this round of fixtures, only Man City (24) have scored more goals at home than Liverpool (16).
