One of the most popular features we published in 2021 was again our 120 Milwaukee-area power brokers, who are many of the key movers and shakers in southeastern Wisconsin's business community.

The response was overwhelming in terms of web traffic and overall reaction from the southeastern Wisconsin business community. I received many emails, calls, texts and posts on Twitter with suggestions of business executives who should be on our list.

We actually did three lists last year — our 100 Milwaukee-area power brokers and then 10 young professionals on our young professional power brokers list, along with 10 Milwaukee-area business executives who are on their way to becoming power brokers.
