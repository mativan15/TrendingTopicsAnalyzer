SUNNYVALE — Applied Materials has widened its shopping spree for expansion space in Silicon Valley through a property purchase in Sunnyvale and office rental deals in Santa Clara.
The tech titan has now spent roughly a quarter-billion dollars buying sites in Sunnyvale over a four-year stretch that has produced a remarkable buying binge for properties in the vicinity of the company's Santa Clara headquarters.
In the most recent property purchase, Applied Materials paid $9 million for a smaller industrial building at 230 Commercial St.
