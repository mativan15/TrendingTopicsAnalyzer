I recently tested the OM System OM-1. It's a serious bit of kit for serious photographers, with a rugged DSLR-style build, an impressive stacked sensor, and excellent lenses. It's also a flagship camera that will set you back $2,200 / £2,000 / AU$3,300 body-only.Yet something altogether different snuck into the headlines about this new camera – its computational modes. Surely computational photography is for the smaller sensors of supposedly inferior smartphones? Not so.The OM System OM-1 has a dedicated menu for 'Computational Modes', which are like advanced versions on the ones you'll find on smartphones.
