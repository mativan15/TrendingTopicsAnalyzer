U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open Friday as investors look ahead to the Labor Department's May jobs report.

Contracts on the S&P 500 fell 0.5%, and futures tied to the Dow eased 110 points, or about 0.3%. Nasdaq futures shed 0.9%.

Shares of Tesla (TSLA) dipped roughly 4% in the early trade after Reuters reported CEO Elon Musk warned of a "super bad feeling" about the economy and said the company is expected to trim about 10% of jobs in an email to executives. Musk also motioned management to "pause all hiring worldwide" in the note.
