Jenson Button has admitted losing wind tunnel access will 'really hurt' Red Bull as a budget cap punishment. The 2009 champion stressed losing some wind tunnel allowance would have a major impact on Red Bull going into future seasons. It comes after McLaren boss Zak Brown pushed for Red Bull to be handed tougher sanctions after they were found guilty of breaching F1's budget cap. Alongside his suggestions was the reduction of wind tunnel time for next season in a bid to impact Red Bull's development.
