Scientists are getting to the point when they can talk about a 'cure' for breast cancer, according to a leading Irish scientist based in the US.Within five to 10 years women with breast cancer will be dying with the disease rather than of it, thanks to groundbreaking new treatments, Prof Donald McDonnell has predicted. 'We're going to get much better at improving resilience while you have breast cancer and at treating it as a chronic disease. Incredible strides are being made at curing it,' he said.
