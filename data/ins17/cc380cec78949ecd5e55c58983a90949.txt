On Jerusalem Day, a few archaeologists spoke about what it's like to work in a city with so much history underground and so much politics above ground.

Ronnie Reich, a retired professor of archaeology from Haifa University, spent almost his entire career excavating in Jerusalem. He says 'ninety-nine percent' of his excavations have been in Jerusalem, digging through the layers of the city from 1969-2010, starting from 'day one after the reunification.' He is almost iconic in Jerusalem archaeology.
