Stock transaction tax revenue halved on-year in Aug. amid economic slump SEOUL, Oct. 20 (Yonhap) -- The amount of tax collected from stock transactions halved on-year in August, data showed Thursday, as the bearish market weighed down retail investors' appetite for local shares. The combined amount of stock transaction tax collected in August came to 528.5 billion won (US$368 million), down from 1.01 trillion won tallied a year earlier, according to Rep. Jin Sun-mee of the main opposition Democratic Party, citing data from the National Tax Service.
