Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich and his Russian business partners are set to lose more than £300 million on their investments in a British telecoms company as it closes in on a rescue deal.Hakan Koc, the Turkish-born entrepreneur behind Berlin-based used-car marketplace Auto1, has emerged as the preferred bidder for Truphone, which has been forced into a pre-pack administration because of the sanctions imposed on Abramovich because of the Ukraine war.Truphone, which was valued at £410 million in 2020, hired FRP in April to carry out 'an immediate review of its strategic options' in response to the sanctions on Abramovich.
