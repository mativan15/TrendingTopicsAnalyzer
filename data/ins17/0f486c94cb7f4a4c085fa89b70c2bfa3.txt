U.S. stocks continued a streak of choppy trading to start Thursday as third-quarter financial results from companies continued to barrel in against a backdrop of persisting growth concerns on Wall Street.

The major indices wavered to start the session, then steadily climbed throughout the morning. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up about 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved up 350 points, or 1.2%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up 1.3%. Meanwhile, Treasury yields held at multi-year highs, with the rate-sensitive 2-year note topping 4.
