Online fashion firm Asos has slumped to an annual loss and warned it will remain in the red over the first half of its new financial year amid turnaround efforts and an 'incredibly challenging' economic backdrop.The group reported pre-tax losses of £31.9 million for the year to August 31 against profits of £177.1 million the previous year after tougher-than-expected trading in recent months as rampant inflation has seen shoppers rein in their spending.On an underlying basis, pre-tax profits slumped 89% to £22 million.
