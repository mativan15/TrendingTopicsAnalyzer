Hedge funds recorded widespread redemptions covering nearly all strategies and size categories last month as stock and bond markets around the globe continued to plunge. Amid this extensive bear market, funds administered by Citco saw their losses widen dramatically to -3.1% in September, compared to the -0.6% return recorded in August. However, the firm also pointed to a wide dispersion in overall returns, as evidenced by the median return of -1.7% for September, which showed that the biggest hedge funds were the worst performers.
