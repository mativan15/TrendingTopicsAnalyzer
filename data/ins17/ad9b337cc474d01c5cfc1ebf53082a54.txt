The Lululemon Everyday Backpack 2.0 is back in stock in two colours.

If you're looking for a new backpack for school or work, you may want to consider Lululemon's Everyday Backpack 2.0. After being sold out for several weeks, the popular backpack is back in stock in two colours.

The Everyday Backpack 2.0 is a shopper favourite thanks to its water-repellant material and laptop-friendly capacity. We have a feeling this restocked backpack, currently available in black and navy, will sell out again soon — so you'll have to move fast if you want to snap it up.
