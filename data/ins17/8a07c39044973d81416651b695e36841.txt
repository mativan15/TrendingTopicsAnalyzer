Shanthi Sepe-Chepuru@ssc627Stop us if you've heard this one already -- it's been a really long time since Cleveland won the World Series. 73 years, if you want to be specific. (Just as a reference point, the Red Sox's championship drought officially became known as the 'Curse of the Bambino' after 68 years.)
It isn't as if the Guardians have been totally absent from the postseason in that time, though. The unfortunate reality of a drought this long is that no franchise plays poorly in 73 consecutive regular seasons -- inevitably, at least once every decade or so, the season doesn't end gracefully on the final day of the regular season, but rather much more abruptly in an elimination game.
