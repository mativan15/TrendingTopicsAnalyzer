While cornerback Greedy Williams is set to make his season debut for the Cleveland Browns, newly-acquired linebacker Deion Jones will not be activated from Injured Reserve. Per Jeremy Fowler of ESPN, we will have to wait another week to see Jones rep the brown and orange for the first time.

Jones was designated for return by the Browns this week, but the team has 21 days to activate him from that moment. With just one week of practice under his belt since shoulder surgery in May (as well as learning a new defensive playbook), it makes sense for the Browns to keep a roster spot for a player that can make an impact against the New England Patriots.
