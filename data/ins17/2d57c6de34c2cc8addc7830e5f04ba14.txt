By Australian Associated Press Published: 01:35 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 01:35 EDT, 30 May 2022 A mini-tornado has cut a path through an Adelaide suburb, bringing down powerlines, trees and damaging houses. The windstorm hit Salisbury, about 20km north of the Adelaide CBD, shortly after 5am on Monday, the South Australian State Emergency Service says. More than 200 people called for help, with SASES reporting it was difficult to get to some areas due to a large amount of debris blocking roads.
