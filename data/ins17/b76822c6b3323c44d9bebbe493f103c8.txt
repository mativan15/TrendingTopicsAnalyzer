The central government has approved 8.1% annual rate of interest on EPF deposits for the financial year 2021-22. Though this is one of the lowest rates given on EPF deposits in the last 40 years, it is still probably the best interest rate being offered among safe fixed income investment options like the PPF, NSC, RBI savings bonds etc. Further, most big banks are still offering an interest rate 6% or less on their fixed deposits to the general public and around 6.5% to senior citizens. While employees typically go for statutory contribution of 12% of basic pay towards EPF, which is matched by employer contribution, however, employees can contribute over and above this limit through the Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF).
