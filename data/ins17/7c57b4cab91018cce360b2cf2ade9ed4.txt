Spirit AeroSystems Inc. is instituting pay raises for its employees represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, including an increased starting pay rate that answers a similar hike last month by Wichita's other major aviation manufacturer.

The city's largest employer confirmed to the WBJ on Thursday that the minimum hourly base pay rate for IAM members will increase from $16.91 to $20.50 effective Oct. 28. Those currently earning less than $20.50 will rise to that amount next week.
