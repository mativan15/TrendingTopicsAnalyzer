Changing habits can be hard, but it becomes easier when the motivation is a healthy family. In Samoa, the Government, with support from the World Bank, is using taxation to encourage healthier lifestyle choices for its people.  
For example, excise taxes have been added to products like cigarettes, sugary drinks, salty snacks, and selected fatty meats. The Government has also been considering reductions in import duties on healthy options like vegetables, fresh chicken, and bottled water to make them more widely affordable.
