The longest run of falling bond prices in nearly four decades, as well as a stark warning on ad spending from Snap, has stocks trading firmly in the red Friday.

U.S. equity futures moved lower Friday, amid one of the longest sell-offs in the Treasury bond market on record, as investors continue about the impact of Federal Federal Reserve rate hikes on a fragile global economy.

Benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields hit a fresh fourteen year high of 4.297% in early New York trading, extending one of the longest weekly stretches of declines since 1984 that has added more than 28 basis points to the paper in just over five trading days.
