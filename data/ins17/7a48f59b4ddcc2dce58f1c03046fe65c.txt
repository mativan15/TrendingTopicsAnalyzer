Can things get any worse for the Denver Broncos?

The Broncos are already missing several injured starters and now they might be losing quarterback Russell Wilson as well.

Wilson has played through a partially torn lat over the last two and a half games, and he also suffered a hamstring injury against the Los Angeles Chargers on Monday evening.

That hamstring injury could be 'fairly significant,' NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Monday. Wilson will undergo an MRI today that will give more clarity on the significance of the quarterback's injury.
