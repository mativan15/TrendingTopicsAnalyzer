Published: 17:31 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 18:16 EDT, 2 June 2022 The Government has confirmed that a consultation which could pave the way for greater use of imperial measurements in post-Brexit Britain will be launched on Friday. Plans to review 'overbearing EU rules' will restore 'common sense' to the statute book, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The EU weights and measures directive came into force in 2000, with traders legally required to use metric units for sale-by-weight or the measure of fresh produce.
