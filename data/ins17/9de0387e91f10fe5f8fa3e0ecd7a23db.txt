Members of K-pop band BTS will fulfil their requirement to undertake mandatory military service in South Korea, the group's agency has confirmed.
Oldest member Jin, 29, will be first, management group HYBE said on Monday.
‘All other members will also serve mandatory military duty according to their plans,' they revealed in a regulatory filing.
All able-bodied men in South Korea are required to perform between 18 and 21 months of military service after their 18th birthday and by 28 at the latest.
However, exemptions have been made in the past for prize-winning athletes, dancers and classical musicians who have been seen as boosting the country's profile internationally.
