In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term Edgewell Personal Care Company (NYSE:EPC) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 51% over a half decade. But it's up 8.1% in the last week. But this could be related to the strong market, with stocks up around 5.9% in the same time.

On a more encouraging note the company has added US$145m to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the five-year loss for shareholders.
