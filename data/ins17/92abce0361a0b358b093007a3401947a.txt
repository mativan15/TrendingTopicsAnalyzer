The U.S. stock markets have taken a beating this year, but there are some markets around the world that are up in 2022. That's why a good diversification strategy is so important, as it provides you with a variety of investments that don't all move in sync. International or global investments are an essential part of a well-diversified portfolio. 
While it can be daunting to identify good international stocks, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks international markets might be more preferable for some investors.
