And there are probably few ways better to achieve this than to engage in a sport or other recreational activity. One company that offers a very specific type of recreational activity for outdoor enthusiasts is Vail Resorts (NYSE:MTN). This company, today, operates 37 mountain resorts and regional ski areas that it collectively refers to as resorts. As part of its business, it also offers other ancillary services like ski school, dining, retail and rental operations, and more.
