Russian emergency officials engaged 180 firefighters, dozens of vehicles and three helicopters to combat the fire. They said 125 people were rescued from the building and crews searched for anyone else who might still be inside. Russia's newly appointed emergencies minister, Alexander Kurenkov, went to the site to oversee the firefighting efforts.
