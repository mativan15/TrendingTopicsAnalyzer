The stock market's historic turnaround last week following a hotter-than-expected inflation report was the beginning of a tradeable short-term rally, according to Morgan Stanley. The S & P 500 closed lower on Friday at 3,583.07, after notching a 2.6% gain the day before following the CPI report. However, stocks were back up on Monday and Michael Wilson, the firm's chief U.S. equity strategist who called the bear market, said the "inflation bull trap" can push the broad market index as high as about 4,000 — 11.
