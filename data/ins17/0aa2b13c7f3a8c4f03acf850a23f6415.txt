The alleged murder of a man on a bush-clad stretch of winding Coromandel road was preceded months earlier by a violent confrontation between the members of two feuding families, a jury has been told. Adrian Reginald George Phillips, 23, is on trial in the High Court in Hamilton. He is facing one charge of murder in relation to the death of Bayden Williams, 20, who was found dead on the Kopu-Hikuai Rd in Coromandel on the evening of Wednesday, August 5, 2020. It is alleged that Phillips rammed Williams' vehicle off a twisting stretch of road about 5km from Kopu.
