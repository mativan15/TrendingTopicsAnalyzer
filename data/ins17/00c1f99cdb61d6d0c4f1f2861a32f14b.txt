LOS ANGELES (CNS) - The Los Angeles City Council is set to meet Friday for the first time since Councilman Kevin de León said he does not plan to resign over his involvement in the City Hall racism scandal. The council will meet virtually due to COVID-19 exposure among council members. The council has so far conducted its business this week despite de León and fellow Councilman Gil Cedillo continuing to resist widespread calls to resign, with just 10 members -- the minimum for a quorum -- present for most of Tuesday and Wednesday's meetings.
