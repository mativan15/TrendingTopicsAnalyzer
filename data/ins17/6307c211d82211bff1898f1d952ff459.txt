Republican lawmakers have pitched a measure that would ban the use of taxpayer money for sexually explicit programs targeting kids, such as New York City's 'drag queen story hour.'
The 'Stop the Sexualization of Children Act' was introduced Tuesday by Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) and more than 30 House Republicans have signed on. 
The bill would prohibit federal funds from being used to promote 'sexually-oriented' materials to children under the age of 10.
The bill defines 'sexually-oriented' as the 'depiction, description, or simulation of sexual activity, any lewd or lascivious depiction or description of human genitals, or any topic involving sexual orientation, gender identity, gender dysphoria, or related subjects.
