The Philadelphia 76ers are putting the finishing touches on their roster ahead of the season opener against the Boston Celtics on Tuesday night.

With a series of sign-and-waives to get players to join the Delaware Blue Coats and three notable cuts as Trevelin Queen, Charles Bassey, and Isaiah Joe moved on, the Sixers' front office parted ways with another player on Sunday and retained one of their current players on a new deal.

25-year-old Philadelphia-born guard Charlie Brown Jr became the latest Sixer to be waived on Sunday morning.
