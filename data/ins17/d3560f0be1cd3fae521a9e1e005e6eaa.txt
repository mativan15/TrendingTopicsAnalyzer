It's been said before and we'll say it again: Eurovision can save lives. The campy, beloved international song competition is now responsible for more than $1.2 million in fundraising, which will reportedly be used to purchase drones to assist the Ukrainian army in its fight against Russia. The winners of this year's contest, Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra, swept the all-important popular vote. The group put up for auction its victory trophy as well as the signature bucket hat that was worn by lead singer Oleh Psiuk during performances.
