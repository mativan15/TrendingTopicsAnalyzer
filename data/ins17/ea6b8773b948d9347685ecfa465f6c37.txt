Before leaving for business meetings in the Middle East last weekend, Dalton Philips, the DAA chief executive, sent a buoyant letter to the TDs on the Oireachtas committee on transport and communications. While passenger numbers had outstripped all forecasts for the post- pandemic recovery, and 4.5 million people had passed through Dublin airport in April and May, he said, 'good progress' had been made on reducing the long departure queues of last spring.The next day Philips, whose remuneration was given as €366,270 in the company's 2020 financial statement, left for Saudi Arabia, where DAA has contracts to manage three airports.
