WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun 2, 2022--The Ecosystem Services Market Consortium (ESMC) and the Conservation Innovation Fund (CIF) announced today the launch of an inaugural project to streamline the creation and sale of environmental credits from dairy and beef producers across the Mid-Atlantic. Through the project, farmers will implement practices such as edge-of-field conservation, increased nutrient management, manure management, cover crops, and reduced tillage. These practices will generate environmental credits from measurable water quality improvements, carbon reduction, and biodiversity enhancements.
