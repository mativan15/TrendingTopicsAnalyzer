Even dating back to last season at Oregon, you could tell Kayvon Thibodeaux was frustrated that he couldn't have the impact on his team that he wanted, due to not being at full strength.
The No. 5 overall pick in the 2022 NFL draft dealt another setback in the preseason, when he suffered a knee injury against the Cincinnati Bengals.
Well, he sure looked like he was back to full strength Sunday, when he sealed a huge win over the Baltimore Ravens with a strip-sack of Lamar Jackson.
After the game, Thibodeaux couldn't contain his emotions after making such a clutch play to give his team the win:

KT a real one.
