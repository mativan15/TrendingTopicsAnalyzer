Governor Kathy Hochul today announced the suspension of certain taxes on motor fuel and diesel motor fuel takes effect today, Wednesday, June 1, 2022. The motor fuel excise tax, State sales tax, and Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District sales tax on motor fuel and diesel motor fuel will remain suspended through the end of the year. This fuel taxes suspension will provide a reduction of at least $0.16 per gallon statewide, with some counties providing additional savings per gallon. "Fuel prices have surged in recent months, hurting working families and small businesses the most, and it is crucial that we provide New Yorkers relief," Governor Hochul said.
