safety, those activities that seek either to minimize or to eliminate hazardous conditions that can cause bodily injury. Safety precautions fall under two principal headings, occupational safety and public safety. Occupational safety is concerned with risks encountered in areas where people work: offices, manufacturing plants, farms, construction sites, and commercial and retail facilities. Public safety involves hazards met in the home, in travel and recreation, and other situations not falling within the scope of occupational safety.
