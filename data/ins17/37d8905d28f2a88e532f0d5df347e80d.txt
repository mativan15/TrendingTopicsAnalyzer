With a few minutes remaining in the match, Cristiano Ronaldo left Manchester United's dugout and made his way along the side of the field and down the tunnel, shunning fans' attempts at a high-five off the soccer great.

He was in no mood for that, not after failing to even make it off the substitutes' bench.

United didn't need him Wednesday.

Producing possibly its most complete performance under Erik ten Hag, United swept past Tottenham in a 2-0 win to move to the brink of the Champions League qualification positions in the Premier League.
