NEW DELHI/SHIMLA: A day after the Election Commission announced the poll schedule for Himachal Pradesh, home minister Amit Shah on Saturday, while addressing a rally in Sirmaur in the state, said PM Narendra Modi believes in development whereas Congress incites and divides people."Shouldn't the country be freed from dynastic politics? PM Modi has done the work of ending 'parivaarvad' in politics... Congress, in the desire for power, hasn't been able to respect our heritage," said Shah in his first rally after poll dates were announced for Himachal on Friday.
