Noel Gallagher has shared heartbreaking news for fans of Oasis – he doesn't think there's any point in the band every getting back together.
Oasis parted ways permanently in 2009 due to a feud between brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, but fans have always held out hope that the pair could put their differences aside and reunite the band one day.
However, Noel poured cold water on a reunion being imminent – if ever – by revealing that financially there is ‘no point' for the band to reform.
He was asked about a potential to get back together on the Pub Talk show, where he quipped: ‘Er, would you go on holiday with your ex-Mrs?!'
Noel explained: ‘As funny as this sounds, Oasis sell as many records now per year as we did when we were together.
