Youth vaping rates remain alarmingly high in the United States; an estimated two million middle and high school students have reported that they used e-cigarettes last year. But another nicotine product is also catching the attention of teens and, now, public health experts. A new class of flavored, nontobacco oral nicotine products—including gummies, gums, lozenges, and tablets—is quickly gaining in popularity among young adults. Sold in flavors such as 'Blue Raz,' 'Cherry Bomb,' and 'Fruit Medley,' their candy-like taste, design, and ability to be concealed are similar to the marketing tactics that propelled sales of flavored, cartridge-based e-cigarettes, until the US Food and Drug Administration banned cartridge-based flavored vapes in 2020.
