Ukrainians who are eligible for military service should be allowed to leave the country in defiance of an active travel ban – if they can pay several thousand dollars, an Interior Ministry adviser suggested on Monday.Most male Ukrainians aged between 18 and 60 cannot legally travel outside their homeland due to martial law.The adviser, Viktor Andrusiv, said Ukraine needed to mobilize 'several hundred thousand soldiers' to fight Russia. However, the current near-total ban on leaving the country for those subject to mobilization was a bad policy, he added.
