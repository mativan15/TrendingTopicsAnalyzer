Shares of Moderna Inc. MRNA, -1.33% fell 1.1% in premarket trading Thursday, after the COVID-19 vaccine maker said it amended its agreement with the European Commission, so member states can delay deliveries of the vaccine booster product Spikevax. The company said deliveries of the booster doses that were scheduled for the second quarter of 2022 can now be delivered later this year or in early 2023. Moderna said participating member states can receive the expected updated bivalent booster candidate following approval by the European Medicines Agency.
