At 92 and 86 years of age, respectively, Warren Buffett and Carl Icahn are two of the greatest living investors  -- and both are still at it!
In fact, these two seniors have been quite active this year, especially around oil giant Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.94%). After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Icahn sold his stake in the company, which he had held since 2019. On the flip side, Warren Buffett has been buying Occidental shares hand over fist throughout the year, scooping up over 20% of the American oil driller.
