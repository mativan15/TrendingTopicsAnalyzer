Jun. 2—JOHNSTOWN, Pa. — Johnstown Police detectives are waiting on laboratory findings on several pieces of evidence to help them solve a Hornerstown double-homicide that occurred in late May.

"Regardless of whether it's a blood sample or gun ballistics, everything sent out by Johnstown Police for testing in any case goes to one lab," Johnstown Police Captain Chad Miller said. "But they are so backed up that it can take several months or more to get results."

Given that the Westmoreland County lab processes evidence for an eight-county area that includes Pittsburgh, Johnstown, Uniontown and elsewhere — homicide cases and other major crimes "really add up," Miller said.
