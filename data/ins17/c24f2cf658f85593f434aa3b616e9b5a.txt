Students who are residents of hostels run by the Social Welfare department of Maharashtra government have complained that they have not received their stipend for nearly three years. However, officials of the department said the stipend has been delayed only for the past five months whereas the stipend for the past two years of the pandemic is disputed as the hostels were closed and this stipend is issued to students in hostels, away from home. 
There are over 400 hostels run by the Social Welfare department across Maharashtra.
