As debate continues over how police officers should present themselves in the upcoming Aurora Pride Parade, questions remain about the impact of the controversy on the event, first held in the city in 2018.Word began spreading about a week ago that Aurora Pride, organizers of the June 12 Pride Parade, had banned wearing of uniforms by police officers who might want to march in the parade.Officers marched in both the 2018 and 2019 parades, some wearing uniforms. But organizers said in a statement that the uniforms upset some people who would take part in the parade because of past incidents across the country involving police and people of color and in the LGBTQ community.
