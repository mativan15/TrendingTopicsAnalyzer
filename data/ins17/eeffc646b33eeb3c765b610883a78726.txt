London CNN —

Even by recent standards, Thursday was a jaw-dropping day in British politics.

Liz Truss, a born-again Brexiteer who took over from Boris Johnson a mere six weeks ago, announced that she was to resign. In her wake, she leaves an economic crisis precipitated by a 'growth plan' full of unfunded tax cuts, and a Conservative Party that may be in office, but is most certainly not wielding much power.

It is hard to overstate just how much impact Truss' accession to the top job had on British politics in such a short space of time.
