Nasa is getting ready to run a simulation of its Artemis Moon Mission in Arizona next week.It's invited media to go and see how it runs through missions on the Moon's surface, so astronauts, engineers and scientists can practise exercises in a simulated 'lunar surface environment'.It's as the space agency prepares to return humans to the moon - the Artemis mission will land the first woman and the first person of colour onto the lunar surface.It looks like Simon Cowell is attempting to disrupt the music industry once again - this time by teaming up producers with TikTokers.
