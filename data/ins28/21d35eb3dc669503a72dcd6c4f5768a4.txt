The Los Angeles Lakers will be starting their regular season on Tuesday evening in San Francisco versus the Golden State Warriors, the defending NBA champions.
That means it will be ring night for the Warriors, which is always an emotional night and the affirmation of a lifelong goal.
One member of the Lakers, forward Juan Toscano-Anderson, will be getting his world championship ring that night, as he played for Golden State last season.
But he made it clear he is living in the present, as he says he wants his new team to win the contest more than he wants to get his ring from his former squad.
