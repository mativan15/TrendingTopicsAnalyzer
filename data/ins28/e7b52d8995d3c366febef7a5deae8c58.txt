Jun. 2—GREENE — George Farris Jr. has a reputation for disappearing at the scene of an accident.

One minute he's standing nearby. The next, he's worming his way into the deformed vehicle.

It's a dangerous job. Farris can never be quite sure what he's getting into.

But with half a century of emergency response experience, there's very little he hasn't seen.

Last week, Maine EMS announced that Farris will be one of five people to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award this year. As a volunteer for the Greene Fire Department since 1973 and a 41-year veteran paramedic for United Ambulance, there are few individuals in the state with a more impressive legacy of service.
