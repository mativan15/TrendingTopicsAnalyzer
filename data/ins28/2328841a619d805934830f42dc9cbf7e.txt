The reauthorization of funding for the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs will allow startups in innovation hubs, such as Birmingham, to get off the ground.

President Joe Biden recently signed the SBIR and STTR Extension Act of 2022 in a move that reauthorized the programs to continue through fiscal year 2025. This includes Innovate Alabama, which will be able to continue supporting small businesses across the state through additional rounds of local funding.
