Rewind to Saturday, May 7th and Munster had earned themselves a 'home' Champions Cup quarter-final at the Aviva Stadium against reigning champions Toulouse. In front of an impassioned 40,000-plus crowd as the Red Army invaded Dublin, they lost, as it were, after a 24-all draw and extra-time by dint of a goal-kicking competition which the five-time winners won 4-2. It was the most honourable exit Munster could have hoped for and, perhaps, a blessing in disguise.After all, a week later Leinster beat Toulouse 40-17, albeit the latter's exertions in overcoming Munster may have contributed to their demise.
