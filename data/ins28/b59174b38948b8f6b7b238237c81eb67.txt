Mohammed Shami looked to have attained close to full fitness as he bowled with full intensity during India's first training session at the Gabba on Sunday, ahead of their first warm-up fixture against England on Monday.
Shami, who had reached Brisbane after recovering from COVID-19 and getting a go-ahead, had replaced an injured Jasprit Bumrah in the squad of 15.
On Sunday, Shami had a full-fledged session with coach Rahul Dravid welcoming him in the mix after a lay-off of around three months.
As far as the first session went, Shami looked to be building on his rhythm as he bowled for quite some time to team's best batter Virat Kohli.
