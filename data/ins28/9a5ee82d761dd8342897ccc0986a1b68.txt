— Jason_OTC (@Jason_OTC) October 15, 2022 Jackson signed a three-year, $22.575 million deal with the Seahawks before the 2021 season. His cap number next year is $11,262,223. They could save $6.5 million in cap space by cutting him before June 1 next year but that would come with a significant dead money penalty.
