The Wrap Ireland native David Burke, Laika Studios chief marketing officer and SVP of business operations, came to the Oregon-based animation house in 2019 from a longtime role as Universal Pictures general manager for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Now he's overseeing the growth of Laika, best known for its stop-motion feature films 'Coraline,' 'ParaNorman,' 'The Boxtrolls,' 'Kubo and the Two Strings' and 'Missing Link' — as well as the upcoming fantasy adventure 'Wildwood,' which includes a voice cast of major stars including Carey Mulligan, Mahershala Ali and Awkwafina and is directed by company president Travis Knight.
