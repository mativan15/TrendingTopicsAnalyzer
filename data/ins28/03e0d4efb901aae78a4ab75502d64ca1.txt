England all-rounder Ben Stokes has slammed the 'stupid' size of boundary marking sponges at stadiums after seamer Reece Topley was ruled out of the Twenty20 World Cup having suffered a leg injury by stepping on one during a fielding drill.
Topley, who has picked up 22 wickets in as many T20 games, sustained ligament damage to his left ankle ahead of a warm-up clash against Pakistan and was replaced by fellow fast bowler Tymal Mills for the tournament in Australia.
The triangular sponges – which are about 20 cm in height and width – have become increasingly common in cricket venues around the world and offer advertising space, but Stokes said the sport's authorities should also address player safety.
