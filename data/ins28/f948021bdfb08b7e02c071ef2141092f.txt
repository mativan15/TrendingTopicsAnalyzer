Vadodara: Two senate members of M S University have approached the Gujarat governor and chairman of the University Grants Commission ( UGC ) demanding a probe into the recent fracas during the gold medals distribution ceremony organized by the university.Unlike other universities in the state, the governor is a visitor at MSU. The senate members have also claimed that out of 192 gold medalists, 54 students are yet to receive their gold medals because of the sheer mismanagement by the university.Though the university had conducted its 70th annual convocation ceremony on February 5, it was after a gap of eight months that the university officials organized a function to distribute the gold medals on Wednesday last.
