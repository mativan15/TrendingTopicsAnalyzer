utah778/iStock via Getty Images Credit Suisse's (NYSE:CS) plan to revamp its investment bank will lead to Christian Meissner, the head of that division, leaving the Swiss lender, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. The bank is set to announce on Oct. 27 its plans to restructure the company to focus more on a capital-light advisory business. The investment bank is expected to be significantly pared back or broken up. The Financial Times has reported that the unit may be split into three units, including a so-called "bad bank" that would include assets that Credit Suisse (CS) intends to dispose of or wind down.
