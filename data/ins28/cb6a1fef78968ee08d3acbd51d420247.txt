The sign indicates that the pushcart operator — who is the child's mother — sells flavored iced jelly, a type of dessert.In an interview with Chinese online media outlet Wanxiang News, the unnamed mother from Tongren City in the southwestern province of Guizhou said that she had no choice but to bring her two-year-old to work.
