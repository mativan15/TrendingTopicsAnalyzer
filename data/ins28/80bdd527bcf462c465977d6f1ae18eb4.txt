DEHRADUN: The National Wildlife Board has given its nod for the ambitious Sonprayag-Kedarnath ropeway project, which aims to bring down travel time to the shrine (which is reached via a trek route) from eight hours currently to 25 minutes. Besides, the board has also approved the construction of a 5-km trek route from Rambada to Garudchatti near Kedarnath.The trek from Sonprayag, where the ropeway would originate, to Kedarnath, a distance of around 18km, takes about eight hours on foot or on mules since there is no motorable road there at present.
