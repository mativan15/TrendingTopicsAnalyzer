The internet has praised a woman who punished her lying husband by changing the Wi-Fi password and not telling him what it is unless he starts paying his share.The man first lied to her about being fired from his job and then asked her to set up a trust fund to pay for his studies in order for him to get a job in a different industry, she said.In a post shared on Reddit on Monday, the wife who goes by the username Sandy/20994, explained that her husband recently lost his job in retail because of his "narcissistic" boss who fired him, and has now been looking for a job for over three months while she's been providing for him.
