Odd, creepy things are popping up around downtown Elgin.

There's a mangled, bloody skeleton with a shrunken head dangling from the Spring Street parking deck. A giant spider web has engulfed South Grove Avenue.

It's just a small taste of what downtown Elgin will become Saturday night when Nightmare on Chicago Street, the fright fest for people who love a good zombie apocalypse, returns after a two-year pandemic hiatus.

Volunteers and Elgin Public Works staff have been preparing scenes all week for the 6 to 11 p.
