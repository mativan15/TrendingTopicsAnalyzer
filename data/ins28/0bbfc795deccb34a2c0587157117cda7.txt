A law introduced by Spain's government to tackle the legacy of General Francisco Franco's fascist dictatorship will be enforced on Friday, to the pleasure of victims' families and associations.

The Democratic Memory law, introduced by the current leftist coalition headed by Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, pardons all victims of the regime who were sentenced on the grounds of political and religious beliefs, ideology or sexual orientation.

Under the new law, the state will also promote the search and exhumations of victims buried in mass graves, which until now were handled by memory associations.
