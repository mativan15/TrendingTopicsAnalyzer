The buy now, pay later (BNPL) industry reached a new milestone with the amount spent on its services in 2021, according to a new report from GlobalData.

GlobalData estimated that the BNPL providers — such as Affirm (AFRM) and Klarna — reached a global transaction value of $120 billion in 2021, and will likely hit $576 billion by 2026. In contrast, global transaction value in 2019 was only $33 billion.

The BNPL space has been red-hot for fintech players like Affirm and Klarna, with established companies like Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) jumping into the foray.
