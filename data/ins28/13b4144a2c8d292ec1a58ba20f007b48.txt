Don't worry, darling: Olivia Wilde's 'special' salad dressing recipe is for everyone. Even Grey Poupon.

The mustard brand went out on a promotional ledge Thursday and announced it is producing limited-edition Don't Worry Dijon jars that riff on the actor-director's new movie, 'Don't Worry Darling,' and feature a classic vinaigrette recipe emblazoned on the back.

This after Wilde posted a salad dressing recipe on social media that alluded to the hot gossip swirling this week around her, her ex and her new boyfriend.
