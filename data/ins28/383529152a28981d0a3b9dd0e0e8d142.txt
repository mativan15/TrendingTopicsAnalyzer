Political leaders in Northern Ireland need to 'make choices' to restore Stormont or else force an 'unnecessary election', Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has warned.Mr Coveney also insisted that Northern Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is 'not bluffing' about his intention to call a fresh Assembly poll next Friday if a powersharing executive is not in place.Speaking on Wednesday during a return visit to a peace-building event in Belfast, seven months after a bomb threat forced him to abandon an address and evacuate the building, he delivered a defiant message to the loyalist paramilitaries linked to the hoax device.
