A senior union leader has launched an angry attack against the Government and called for a general election amid the continuing political turmoil.

Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, pledged to fight plans to introduce further legislation on taking industrial action, as unions continue to hold strikes in growing disputes over pay, jobs and conditions.
