An improved clean and green means of coating materials for efficient wastewater treatment processes is now possible thanks to the Vortex Fluidic Device. The adaptability and wider clean chemistry applications of the extraordinary Vortex Fluidic Device (VFD)—invented by Flinders University's Professor Colin Raston—continues to achieve unexpected innovations. This time the VFD has been used to demonstrate potential for water treatment with real time detection of impurities. Since 2013, Professor Raston has been working with his team to explore the possibilities of the VFD, which is capable of controlling chemical reactivity, materials processing and probing the structure of self-organized systems, enabling rapid and now predictable modifications.
