By Maria Martinez The fragility of the eurozone manufacturing sector was once again clear in the purchasing managers index for May, as manufacturing orders fell for the first time since June 2020, S&P Global said in a note. The S&P Global manufacturing PMI fell to 54.6 in May from 55.5 in April. This is the lowest mark in 18 months. "Eurozone manufacturers continue to struggle against the headwinds of supply shortages, elevated inflationary pressures and weakening demand amid rising uncertainty about the economic outlook," Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in a note.
