It will not be an easy role to assume. In January, the CMA's chief executive Andrea Coscelli announced that he would step down amid frustration among ministers that he failed to take advantage of Brexit. The boss of the UK's Open Banking unit, which falls under the CMA's purview, quit last year after an independent investigation found that he oversaw a culture of bullying and intimidation.
Management is one issue, but the CMA's policies have been little better. Under former chairman Lord Tyrie, who left in 2020, the body pursued a populist agenda that sought extensive powers to bypass courts to fine firms for what he viewed as bad behaviour.
