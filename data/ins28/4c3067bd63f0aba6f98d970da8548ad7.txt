(Bloomberg) -- Tesla just followed up a vehicle deliveries report that fell short of expectations with quarterly revenue that also was a bit lower than hoped, disappointing investors looking for a more clear-cut kibosh on debate over whether it's starting to have demand issues.Elon Musk has a broad target to grow sales around 50% annually. While the company now expects to fall just short of that mark this year, one of its models is climbing toward the top of global sales rankings.Tesla doesn't disclose the split in sales between its Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle, but given the latter's performance, maybe it should.
