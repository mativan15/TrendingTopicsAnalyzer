Netflix is making it easier for password-sharing users to set up their own accounts with a new tool that allows them to move their profile while keeping all of their customized recommendations, viewing history, My List, saved games and other preferences.
The 'much requested' Profile Transfer feature rolls out to subscribers globally Monday. Users will be notified when Profile Transfer becomes available on their account.
Except for the United States and Korea, where members must enable the function in their preferences, the feature will be enabled automatically for all countries.
