White Americans are now more likely to die from Covid-19 than black Americans, according to new analysis of coronavirus figures. The shift has surprised experts. An imbalance in death rates among the country's racial groups has been a defining feature of the now-two-and-a-half-year-long pandemic, but it was not expected that the ratio would reverse. From the start in early 2020, Covid-19 was killing more black people than white, a phenomenon experts put down to a disparity between the healthcare access available to the different groups, and the prevalence of underlying health conditions.
