A Christchurch restaurant and takeaway business' plan to attract public funding for new outlets has fallen short, so it will now shift its focus to the blockchain. Anton Matthews, along with his wife Jess Matthews and sister Maia Matthews, opened Fush in the suburb of Wigram in late 2016. In April, they launched a crowdfunding campaign as they worked towards opening four new restaurants around the city. It fell short of its minimum goal at the end of May. Fush has become well known through its focus on te reo Māori, and through Anton Matthews' public profile promoting the language and tikanga Māori.
