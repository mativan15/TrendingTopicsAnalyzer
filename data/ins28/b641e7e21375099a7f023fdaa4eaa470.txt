The theater brought Amanda Magee to the East Coast.

Magee grew up in Oregon and Washington, but when she started her career, she got a job as a carpenter and assistant production manager for the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Williamstown, Massachusetts.

On the morning of 9/11, she and her husband, Sean Magee, were on their way to take a flight out of Logan Airport in Boston. After, they decided they wanted to shift careers and move somewhere smaller. He's from Lake George and got two job offers — one in Saratoga Springs and one in Bellingham, Washington.
