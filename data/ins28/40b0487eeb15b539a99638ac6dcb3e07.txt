Reliance Brands Ltd (RBL) and Plastic Legno SPA have signed a joint venture arrangement through which RBL will acquire 40% stake in Plastic Legno SPA's toy manufacturing business in India. This investment by RBL will help to bring in vertical integration for RBL's toy business and help diversify the supply chain to manufacture toys in the country.

Plastic Legno SPA is owned by the Sunino group of Italy which is into toy manufacturing for more than 25 years in Europe. The group started its India business in 2009 to both tap the local market and set up a manufacturing base.
