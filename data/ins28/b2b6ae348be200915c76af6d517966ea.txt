By Reuters Published: 07:08 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 07:08 EDT, 2 June 2022 PARIS, June 2 (Reuters) - French power giant EDF wants to pay less for a nuclear turbine unit it is buying from General Electric because its business could be hurt by Russia's Rosatom being its main client, a senior source said. The source, who has direct knowledge of the matter and was confirming a report published on Thursday by French daily les Echos, said Rosatom accounted for the bulk of the Arabelle turbine maker's orders, which could now be cancelled because of the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions against Russia.
