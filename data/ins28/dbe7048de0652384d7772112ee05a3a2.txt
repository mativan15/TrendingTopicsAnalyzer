NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Insight Enterprises Inc (NSIT.O), which helps clients with the critical but largely unsung work of digital transformation, is poised for a dramatic stock price jump as its revenue stream becomes more predictable, investment firm ValueAct's chief executive said.Mason Morfit, the firm's chief executive and chief investment officer, said the company's stock price, currently trading at $87.63, could climb to as high as $500 a share in the next five years."We find companies that have the opportunity to transform into global champions by becoming better aligned with the mega trends in the economy, whether that's cloud computing, streaming television, or medical technologies, and the list goes on and on," Morfit said during a presentation at the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Investor Summit.
