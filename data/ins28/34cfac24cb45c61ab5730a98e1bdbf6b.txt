Real Housewives of Potomac star Candiace Dillard-Bassett is not taking costar Gizelle Bryant's recent comments about her husband, Chris Bassett, well.
 
Following Gizelle's accusation in Sunday's episode that Chris made her feel "uncomfortable," Candiace took to Twitter to call out her costar across several tweets.
 
"The first & most relevant thing I can say is that it's hard to say anything at all because I #supportwomen I #believewomen and I support #metoo," began the "Drive Back" singer, 35.
 
"I can't tell a woman how to feel about a man's presence in her orbit," she continued.
