SoxFest 2023 will not take place in January, the Chicago White Sox announced Friday, saying it was 'due to several factors.'

'We recognize our fans may be disappointed the event will not take place,' the Sox said in a statement. 'Please check back throughout the 2023 baseball season for updates regarding future plans.'

The most recent SoxFest — the 28th edition — occurred in late January 2020. The 2021 event was canceled because of the the COVID-19 pandemic. And 2022 SoxFest was canceled, with the Sox noting at the time the challenges of projecting and managing COVID-related protocols in an indoor setting.
