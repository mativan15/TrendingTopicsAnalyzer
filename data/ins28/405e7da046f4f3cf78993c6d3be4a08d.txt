School students in India can soon earn ‘credits' from classroom learning as well as extracurricular activities and deposit them in a ‘bank' — much like the system already being followed in some colleges and universities.
The policy to integrate this credit system, the draft National Credit Framework (NCrF), was put in public domain by Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Wednesday (October 19). It has been drafted by a 11-member committee headed by National Council of Vocational Education and Training (NCVET) chairperson Nirmaljeet Singh Kalsi.
