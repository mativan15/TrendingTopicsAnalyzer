Oct. 15—NEW LONDON — George Potts of New London is "saving the past one yard at a time."

It's the motto of Three Cs Metal Detecting, a company Potts started a few years back to serve as an outlet for his passion of digging up hidden treasures in backyards around the city. The three Cs is named after his kids: Carly, Cole and Cayley.

He doesn't actually make money with the business. That's not the point, Potts said. Instead, it's the thrill of the hunt and the uncovering of bits of the city's history.
