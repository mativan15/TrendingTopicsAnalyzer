Publicis Groupe SA upgraded its expectations for 2022 organic-revenue growth as it reported third-quarter results, saying that so far, it hasn't seen an impact from clients cutting spending despite signs the ad market could be slowing down.The Paris-based advertising holding company, which owns agencies including Saatchi & Saatchi, Leo Burnett and Zenith, said it expects to deliver organic growth of 8.5% for the year, up from a previous estimate of 6% to 7%. Organic growth refers to the change in net revenue excluding the impacts of acquisitions, disposals and currency fluctuations.
