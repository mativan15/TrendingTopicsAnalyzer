The Biden White House could experience a changing of the guard after November's midterm elections, and analysts see the U.S. Treasury as one department that's likely to get a new leader. The period 'after a midterm shellacking' would be a 'natural culling point' at the White House, said Ben Koltun, director of research at Beacon Policy Advisors, in a note on Friday. White House chief of staff Ron Klain is expected to leave at that time, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen looks likely to depart after the midterms as well, according to Koltun.
