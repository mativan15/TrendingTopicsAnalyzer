Oct. 20—A group of toddlers rushed from the parking lot at High Country Orchard to check out the waiting cow train early Wednesday morning.

Made up of little metal carts painted to look like cows, with names and all, the cow train has become one of the most popular ways to see the orchard, said Angie McDermott, a manager there.

At $5 a ride, it's "really popular," McDermott said.

The orchard ramped up their weekday offerings this year under new management.

They offer school tours complete with a petting zoo and pumpkin patch.
