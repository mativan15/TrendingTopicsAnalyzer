Brendan Fraser's awards season with 'The Whale' continued over the weekend at the Mill Valley Film Festival, where he was on hand for a screening of the film and to accept the annual event's lifetime achievement award. Speaking to SFGATE on the red carpet (via Entertainment Weekly), Fraser issued a humorous apology to the city of San Francisco due to a traffic jam the 'George of the Jungle' production caused over 25 years ago. Mill Valley is about 14 miles north of San Francisco. 'When we were doing ‘George of the Jungle,' George goes to rescue a parachutist tangled in the Golden Gate Bridge,' Fraser said, citing the Golden Gate Bridge instead of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge which was featured in the film.
