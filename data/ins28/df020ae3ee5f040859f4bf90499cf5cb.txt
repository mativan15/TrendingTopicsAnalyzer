Since Russia attacked Ukraine in February, Ukrainians have asked Western countries for fighter jets.

The "Buy Me a Fighter Jet" campaign is raising private donations to buy jets for Ukrainian forces.

The campaign is ongoing, but a Ukrainian pilot says missiles would now be more useful against Russia.

Since Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, Ukrainians — from the general public to top officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy — have urged the US and its allies to provide fighter jets so Ukraine's air force can fight off Russia's larger, better-equipped military.
