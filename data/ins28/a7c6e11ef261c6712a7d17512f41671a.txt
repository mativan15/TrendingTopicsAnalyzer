GT Real Estate Holdings, the company billionaire owner David Tepper established for the Carolina Panthers' headquarters project in Rock Hill, owes nearly $50 million to various entities involved in the work, according to bankruptcy documents it filed in Delaware on Wednesday night.

Its two biggest creditors are Mascaro and Barton Malow, the general construction contractors in charge of the site, and York County, South Carolina, which together are owed almost $48 million. The rest of the companies listed in the filing are owed much smaller amounts.
