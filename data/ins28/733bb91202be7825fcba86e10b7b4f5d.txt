PANAJI: Goa excise commissioner Narayan M Gad on Thursday dismissed a complaint that sought cancellation of the liquor licence of Silly Souls Bar and Restaurant in Assagao, ruling that there was a procedural lapse in the process of issuing and renewing the bar's excise licence but these did not warrant cancellation of its licence.'If a liquor licence is either suspended or cancelled on petty issues, it not only hampers the business but also affects the revenue of the state,' the commissioner said in his 19-page order.
