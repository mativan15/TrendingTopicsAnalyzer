jetcityimage Introduction 3M (NYSE:MMM) is known as a large conglomerate that has been growing steadily for years and increasing its dividends year over year. Currently, the company future looks less rosy because of a lawsuit filed over malfunctioning earplugs. American soldiers suffer hearing loss and 230,000 jury lawsuits against 3M are demanding hefty damages. Bloomberg estimates the company could suffer up to $100B in losses and plaintiff's lawyers are trying to limit 3M's dividend payments. The stock has been punished hard as a result but had been in a bear market since 2018.
