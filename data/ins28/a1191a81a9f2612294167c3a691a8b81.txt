Dimitrios Kambouris Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's bullishness on his company's stock was certainly not dented by a disappointing earnings result on Wednesday evening. For the Austin-based automakers third quarter, shipping challenges hampered deliveries and led to revenue missing the analyst consensus. Margins also came in lighter than anticipated as CFO Zachary Kirkhorn cited 'raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange' as the biggest headwinds hitting the automaker in Q3. Shares of the world's most valuable automaker slid over 6% in early trading on Thursday, trending toward a 52-week low marked on Friday, October 14.
