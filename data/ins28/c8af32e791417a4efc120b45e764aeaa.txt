Dawg City adding second location

Milwaukee hot dog vendor Dawg City is growing its footprint.

The business by Ken and Tonya Hughes started with a location at the 3rd St. Market Hall in downtown Milwaukee. Now, the husband-and-wife team is adding a second location at another food hall. Dawg City will be part of the North Avenue Market, which recently opened inside a former Associated Bank branch building.

Ken Hughes said he expects the second Dawg City location to open in November, pending the licensing process.
