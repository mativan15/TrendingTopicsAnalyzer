Chelsea are set to thrash out a deal to land Sevilla defender Jules Kounde when Todd Boehly's proposed takeover is officially finalised over the next few days, according to reports in Spain. Kounde has long been admired by those in command at Stamford Bridge and came close to making the switch to west London a year ago but was ultimately forced to stay put after the two clubs failed to agree on a transfer fee despite months of negotiations.Chelsea have retained their interest in Kounde in spite of their failure to bring him in last summer, with the likes of Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen set to leave the club upon the expiry of their contracts at the end of the current season.
