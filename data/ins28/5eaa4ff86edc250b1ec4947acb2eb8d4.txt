The Institute for Human Services is working to combat the labor shortage in Hawaii, helping an average of 20-25 homeless or at-risk individuals find work each month, IHS Program Manager and Recruiter and Trainer November Morris told Pacific Business News on Tuesday.

"We really help them to find work in all kinds of places," Morris said.

The jobs IHS have placed people in recently include 7/11, Aloha Petroleum, Dave and Busters, Flying Food Group, Rainbow Drive-In, Lowes, ProPark, Red Lobster, McDonald's, and more, according to Morris.
