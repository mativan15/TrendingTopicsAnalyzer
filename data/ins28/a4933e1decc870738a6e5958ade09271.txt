The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) said there is 'substantial reason to believe' that Republican Reps. Pat Fallon (Texas) and John Rutherford (Fla.) failed to report financial transactions on time, which is a violation of House rules and federal law.
In reports made public on Tuesday, the OCE — an independent watchdog that probes unethical behavior from lawmakers and refers incidents to the House Ethics Committee — outlined more than 100 financial transactions the two lawmakers reported past the Ethics Committee's deadline, some of which which were outside the grace period and triggered late fines
According to the OCE, Fallon — who was first elected to the House in 2020 — failed to disclose 122 financial transactions on time between January and December 2021.
