Swiss company Climeworks plans to phase out the first-generation technology that made it a pioneer in the business of carbon removal. The move is part of Climeworks' pivot away from selling its captured carbon dioxide to companies like Coca-Cola. Instead, Climeworks says it will focus on efforts to store the CO2 underground permanently.Climeworks became the first company to suck carbon dioxide out of the air and sell it as a product back in 2017. That's when its direct air capture (DAC) plant called Capricorn opened in Hinwil, Switzerland.
