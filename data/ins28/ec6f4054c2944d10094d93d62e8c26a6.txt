(Bloomberg) -- Sudan's military and a group of political opponents are close to a deal that aims to resolve the crisis caused by last year's coup by restoring a civilian prime minister and guaranteeing the army some independence, according to people familiar with the secret US-brokered discussions. Talks in recent weeks, also facilitated by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and UK, have seen the army and the country's most powerful militia hold direct negotiations with members of the Forces for Freedom and Change, a major opposition coalition, according to the people, who include diplomats.
