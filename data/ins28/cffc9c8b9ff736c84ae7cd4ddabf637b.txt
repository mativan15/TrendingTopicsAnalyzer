WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is set to resume her campaign-style promotion of President Joe Biden's economic initiatives on Friday, visiting a Virginia business incubator to tout U.S. investments in research, semi-conductors, clean energy and other technologies.

The Treasury said Yellen will deliver remarks and meet with entrepreneurs at the Virginia Innovation Partnership Corp (VIPC) in Herndon, Virginia, a booming Washington suburb near Dulles International Airport.
