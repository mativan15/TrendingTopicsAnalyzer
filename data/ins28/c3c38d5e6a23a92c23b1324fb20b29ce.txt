(Bloomberg) -- South Korea's early exports dropped in October, suggesting a weakening of demand that reinforces signs of a slowdown in the global economy.Daily shipments declined 9% on average in the first 20 days of the month compared with a year earlier, the customs office said Friday. It was the first time in two years that the reading, which reflects working-day differences, had fallen and a clear sign of cooling momentum.Headline exports also fell 5.5% for a trade deficit of $5 billion. Korea's chip sales dropped 12.
