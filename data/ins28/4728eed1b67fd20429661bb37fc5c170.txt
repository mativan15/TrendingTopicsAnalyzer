Axe_Olga/iStock via Getty Images Copper futures that have fallen nearly 30% from a peak in March do not reflect a "strikingly tight" physical market for the metal, Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) CEO Richard Adkerson said Thursday. The decline in copper prices reflects investor concerns about the global economy, weak data from China, the European energy crisis and a strong dollar, so it is "striking how negative financial markets feel about this market and yet the physical market is so tight," Adkerson said during today's earnings conference call after the company reported slightly better than expected Q3 results.
