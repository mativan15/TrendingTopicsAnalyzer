A target of 5 million euros (£4.3m) was met within just three-and-a-half days as Lithuanians rushed to donate funds to help another country formerly under Moscow's rule.

Most donations were made in small amounts to buy the Byraktar TB2 unmanned aerial vehicle from Turkey.

The crowdfunder was organised by Laisves TV, which said it would transfer the funds to Lithuania's defence ministry, which will buy the drone and its munitions for Ukraine.
