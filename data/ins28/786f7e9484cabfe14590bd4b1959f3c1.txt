A new chocolate maker on the block is taking on competitors via an innovative marketing approach. Ocho Chocolate was supported by investors via the crowdfunding platform PledgeMe, after Cadbury closed its Dunedin factory in 2018, with 350 jobs lost. Manager Angela Howell said the company has introduced a 'tasting journey' box, which includes eight of its chocolates and two unnamed commercial competitors – one from New Zealand and another from overseas. ‘'We are that confident,'' she said of their products.
