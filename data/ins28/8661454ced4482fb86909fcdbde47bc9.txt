Published: 20:10 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 20:12 EDT, 2 June 2022 Finishing all meals before 3pm and not snacking in the evening boosts health and helps people lose weight, a review has suggested.Experts who analysed 250 previous studies have advised fasting for at least 14 hours a day and limiting food intake between 6am and 3pm.They say it works best with the body clock and is closer to how our hunter-gather ancestors would have eaten, as they would not have had unrestricted access to food.People who ate this way had better control of their blood sugar, lost weight, shed dangerous fat around their midriff and reduced inflammation, researchers claimed.
