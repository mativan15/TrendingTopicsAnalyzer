BI Graphics Kiersten and Julien Saunders first met at their corporate hospitality job, then got married a year and a half later. At the time, the couple subscribed to the idea of "Black excellence." Julien says, "Black excellence is this term that we use to label anyone who is doing really well, or even just a term of endearment that is used whenever someone is shining brightly in an area where less may have been expected of them."Kiersten and Julien both had six-figure corporate jobs in Atlanta that allowed them to travel all over the country.
