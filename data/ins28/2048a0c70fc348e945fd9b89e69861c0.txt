Amid rising chorus for putting a price cap on Russian oil by US and the European Union, India has said that it will examine the proposal, Reuters reported. Russia President Vladimir Putin has seethed over the West's plan to put the price cap that will limit Moscow's crude oil revenue as it seeks to up the ante against Russia.

India, which has benefited from Russian cheap oil, has not taken a decision so far. However, officials and industry executives have urged not to join the price cap proposal as it would hurt India's interest.
