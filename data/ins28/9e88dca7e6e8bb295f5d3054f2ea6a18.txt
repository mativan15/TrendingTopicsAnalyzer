During the
second quarter of the year, Sasa International Group's retail and wholesale
turnover decreased by 1.1 per cent, with the group's turnover 62.1 per cent
lower than it was during the same period in the previous financial year prior
to Covid-19. However, despite the protracted impact of the
pandemic on retail and wholesale turnover in Hong Kong and Macau SARs, the
same-store sales increased by 6.7 per cent. Similarly, online sales in Hong Kong SAR
increased over 70 per cent year on year, driven by the group's own online
channels.
