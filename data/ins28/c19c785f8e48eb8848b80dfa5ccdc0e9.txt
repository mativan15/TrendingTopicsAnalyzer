By Alice Uribe SYDNEY--Insurance Australia Group Ltd. announced an on-market share buy-back of up to 350 million Australian dollars (US$217.30 million), which will be funded by a reduction in its business-interruption provision. The insurer on Monday said it had reduced its net BI provision from A$975 million to A$615 million, after Australia's High Court on Friday denied a special leave to appeal in a legal case. "The revised BI provision is based on IAG's actuarial modeling and includes a significant risk margin," IAG said in a regulatory filing.
