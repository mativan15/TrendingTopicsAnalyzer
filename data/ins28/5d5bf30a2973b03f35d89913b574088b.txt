Canadians are planning to spend as much or more on Halloween this year, according to the Retail Council of Canada, but plans to celebrate could be disrupted by inflation and supply chain issues, one expert says.
'We know that there is a crisis across several industries where people aren't able to just get the workers in, to ramp up manufacturing, to ramp up shipping, and do all of those things because of disruptions that happened during the pandemic,' said Tandy Thomas, an associate professor of marketing at the Smith School of Business at Queen's University.
