Tesla, the publicly listed company headed by the world's richest man, Elon Musk, delivered nearly 350,000 cars from July to September this year - a record number but short of analysts' expectations. The electric car maker delivered 343,830 cars across the three months thanks to increased production in China, a figure that was less than expected as supply chain issues and car shipping problems persisted.
It's an increase from the 241,300 vehicles delivered during the same period last year.Shares fell steeply after the announcement of the company's results.
