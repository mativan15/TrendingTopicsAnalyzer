Incoming Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has vowed to set the country on a new course on immigration, criminal justice and energy policy as he presented a centre-right coalition government led by his conservative Moderate Party.The new Cabinet consists of 24 ministers — 13 men and 11 women.Thirteen are Moderates, six are Christian Democrats and five are Liberals.The three centre-right parties secured a majority in Parliament after the September 11 elections with the help of the Sweden Democrats, a far-right party which has entered the political mainstream after years of being treated as a pariah by the other parties.
