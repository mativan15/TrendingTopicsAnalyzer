The U.S. Department of Education canceled about $5.8 billion in outstanding student loans for more than 560,000 borrowers in the largest single loan forgiveness action taken by the government to date, the department announced Wednesday. The cancellation applies to all those who attended schools operated by the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges, one of the largest for-profit education companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2015. Corinthian Colleges has faced several lawsuits since its founding in 1995 — but perhaps the most notable is from 2013, when Vice President Kamala Harris sued Corinthian while she was attorney general of California for "deceptive and false advertising and recruiting" among other allegations, according to the department.
