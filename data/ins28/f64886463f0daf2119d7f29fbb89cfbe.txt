Shawn Michaels has teased an impending WWE NXT debut for Dwayne ‘The Rock' Johnson's daughter Simone.
The 20-year-old star – who is using the stage name Ava Raine – has been impressing people with her skills on the microphone, and it doesn't sound like it'll be too long before she finally steps between the ropes in front of a live crowd.
NXT boss Michaels – who serves as the company's senior vice president of talent development creative – is playing a key role in developing younger talent for the big time, including Ava and fellow trainer Valerie Loureda.
