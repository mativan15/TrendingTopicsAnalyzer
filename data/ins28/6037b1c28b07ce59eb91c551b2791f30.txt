Grandpops Army Navy Store is located at 505 Auburn Ave. in Swedesboro. (Google Maps)SWEDESBORO, NJ — In his 11-plus years of owning and running Grandpops Army Navy store in Swedesboro, Joe Musumeci said he had never thought much about helping people a half a world away.However, that changed when two women — Victoria Veretchak and Marta Makar — who grew up in Ukraine — approached him shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. After hearing the women describe Putin's threats to any country that tried to help Ukraine, and how some of those still in the country wanted to fight the enemy but "didn't have money to buy uniforms to do so," the trio came up with the idea of providing uniforms to those in Ukraine.
