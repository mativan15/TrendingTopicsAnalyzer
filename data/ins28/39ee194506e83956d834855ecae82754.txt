Published: 19:30 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 19:30 EDT, 17 October 2022 Doctors can't shut their eyes to the fraud that happens within their profession, top medic Dr Nick Coatsworth says.  A bombshell investigation by the Sydney Morning Herald and the ABC on Monday claimed an estimated $8billion a year is being siphoned from Medicare by doctors charging for services they did not deliver or over-servicing patients.Extreme cases involved a GP billing dead people at an aged care home, a dentist who exposed children to radiation for unnecessary procedures and doctors wrongly diagnosing conditions such as diabetes to claim a higher Medicare rebate.
