It looks like Katie Price and fiancé Carl Woods are back on the straight and narrow following split rumours, with Katie now hinting at a wedding.
The reality star's relationship with the car salesman has been quite the rollercoaster as of late, as reports stated they had called time on their romance.
Both Katie, 44, and Carl, 33, shut down the speculation, though, and recently put on a smiley appearance at an event before attending the National Television Awards together this month.
Now, the former glamour model seems very serious about walking down the aisle once more, as she's on the hunt for a wedding dress designer.
