After 65 days in lockdown, normality is finally coming back to Shanghai. Restrictions are being swiftly lifted with the city breathing a collective sigh of relief. However, Tesla's (TSLA) reliance on its Shanghai Gigafactory is set to impact June quarter results, so believes Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh.
