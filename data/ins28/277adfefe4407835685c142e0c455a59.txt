TVLine.com 'When in doubt, Elanor Brandyfoot, always follow your nose,' The Stranger tells the young Harfoot in The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power's Season 1 finale.The line is almost identical to what Gandalf (played by Ian McKellen) tells Pippin in Peter Jackson's Fellowship of the Ring, leaving many wondering if The Stranger — who was revealed to be an Istari — is the famed Grey Wizard. Adding to speculation is his friendship with Nori and the other Harfoots, which feels reminiscent of Gandalf's relationships with both Bilbo Baggins and Bilbo's nephew Frodo.
