PITTSBURGH - So many words have been written about Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. and Senate hopeful John Fetterman's tattoos. The imposingly statured, baldheaded 53-year-old former mayor of Braddock, Pa., has ink of the Pittsburgh borough's Zip code and the dates of every violent death that took place there while he served in office, as well as a Nine Inch Nails lyric: "I will make you hurt."

But what about his wife's tattoos?

"This is the most recent one," says Gisele Barreto Fetterman, 40, pulling her sleeve up past her wrist in an East Liberty coffee shop to reveal a tiny outline of a bird.
