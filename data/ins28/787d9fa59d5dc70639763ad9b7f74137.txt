Around 30 former RAF pilots have been lured by Beijing to coach Chinese aviators in exchange for reported salaries of up to £240,000. The Defence Intelligence service is putting out a "threat alert" to warn personnel against approaches amid fears efforts are intensifying as tension between theWest and China grows.And Armed Forces minister James Heappey said the Government will make it illegal to work for foreign militaries once the alert is issued.Mr Heappey said the situation is "deeply uncomfortable" but stressed approaches to pilots are not illegal.
