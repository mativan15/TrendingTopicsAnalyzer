In a scathing letter attacking Prime Minister Liz Truss, she said that she had 'concerns about the direction of this government' and that ministers had broken 'key pledges' to voters in a number of policy areas. It is the latest blow to Ms Truss's Government following the meltdown of financial markets prompted by Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget and his subsequent sacking. Ms Braverman's departure will create further headaches for Ms Truss as she struggles to maintain her grip on power. The former Home Secretary was a popular figure on the right of the party and one of Ms Truss's most prominent backers during the Tory leadership contest.
