Small retailers targeting Gen Z and Gen Alpha through social media should expect higher profits, according to Capterra's SMB Holiday Retail Report

ARLINGTON, Va., October 19, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Small and midsize businesses (SMBs) are optimistic about the holiday shopping season—a stark contrast to their big-box counterparts that have cut hiring and brace for excess inventory along with expected profit losses. Capterra's SMB Holiday Retail Report reveals that more than half of SMB retailers predict higher profits this year due to an increase in marketing spend on targeting younger audiences through social media, advance supply-chain planning, and embracing hybrid store models.
