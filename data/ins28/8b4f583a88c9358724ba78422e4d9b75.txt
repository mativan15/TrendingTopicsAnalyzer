THE MUCH-AWAITED online registration process for medical under graduation (UG) courses has finally started in Maharashtra, and a provisional merit list for the same will be out on October 25. Also, in a great relief to the students, there is no clause of security deposit like the one introduced in PG (Post Graduation) admissions this year. Additionally, candidates will get fresh choices of colleges to be filled in each round.
The Maharashtra Common Entrance Test (CET) Cell late Monday released the information brochure for the admission process for health science courses including MBBS, BDS, BHMS, and BAMS among others.
