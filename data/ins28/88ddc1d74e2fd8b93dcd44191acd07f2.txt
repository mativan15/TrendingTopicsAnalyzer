Pakistan is expected to be taken off the Financial Action Task Force grey list at the global watchdog body's plenary session in Paris this week, although it will be asked to update members on its actions to counter terror financing and money laundering on a regular basis, in a decision that India will monitor closely. The final decision on Pakistan, which has faced stringent financial sanctions and difficulties in availing international loans as a result of the FATF grey list, or 'jurisdictions under increased monitoring' list since February 2018, will be announced at the end of the two-day session on October 20-21.
