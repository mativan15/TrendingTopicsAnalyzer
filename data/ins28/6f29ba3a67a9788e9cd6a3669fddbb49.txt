peepo/E+ via Getty Images Joby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY) isn't a household name yet but I expect things to change in the next few years as the eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) industry grows exponentially in the future. eVTOLs allow people to travel around cities at a much faster rate and could lead to a new era of human productivity if we solve the global vehicle traffic crisis. Joby was founded in 2009 by JoeBen Bevirt who had dreams of flying electric cars as a child. The company raised capital through a SPAC deal, but JOBY shares are currently down 39% from its initial $10 SPAC level.
