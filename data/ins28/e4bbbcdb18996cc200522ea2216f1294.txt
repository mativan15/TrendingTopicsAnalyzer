American Eagle Outfitters Inc. is taking steps across its businesses to set itself up for a stronger second half of 2022 following a relatively soft first half.Ahead of Friday's open, the retailer announced an accelerated share buyback agreement with JP Morgan Chase for $200 million of its stock, part of a broader effort to shore up its capital structure. The move comes after a disappointing first-quarter earnings report last week that missed the FactSet consensus for both profit and revenue. American Eagle executives say tough stimulus-enhanced comparisons, unseasonable weather, inflation, high gas prices and higher freight expenses were to blame.
