In Nagaland, where it occupies the singular position of leading the longest-running insurgency in the country, the NSCN (I-M) is used to being treated with kid gloves by parties – a far cry from the criticism that has been directed at it recently by the BJP .
State BJP president Temjen Imna Along recently said in the state assembly that the NSCN (I-M)'s demand for a separate flag and constitution – one of the intractable points over which the Naga solution is stuck – had been described as Union Home Minister Amit Shah as 'unachievable', even in '400 years'.
