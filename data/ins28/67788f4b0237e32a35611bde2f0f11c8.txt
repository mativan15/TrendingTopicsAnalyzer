Earth and ocean researchers at the University of Canterbury (UC) are using drones, satellite tracking and infrared sensors to improve ocean health. The non-invasive technology used by UC earth system scientist Associate Professor Travis Horton and his team of researchers to monitor the vital signs of endangered paikea humpback whales is now being used to help understand the condition of our oceans ecosystem. "The ocean makes up more than 70% of our planet, and because it is difficult to access such a large area, we have very little knowledge of what is happening in there," lead researcher Associate Professor Horton says.
