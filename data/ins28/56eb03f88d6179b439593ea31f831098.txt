To the editor: In an earlier column than his most recent one on the mayoral candidates and homelessness, Steve Lopez called Rick Caruso's plan to build 30,000 housing units a 'short-term fix at best.' I've worked with homeless people for nearly a decade, and I believe that we need a short-term fix.

New York does not have sidewalk encampments like Los Angeles. This is not because it has low rents or a surging economy. It's because encampments are illegal. As long as a bed is available, a person cannot camp on the sidewalk.
