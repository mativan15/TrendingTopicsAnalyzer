The teaser of the upcoming film of Telugu superstar Ravi Teja, Dhamaka, has been released. Packed with comedy, this seems to be a mass-action film. The teaser shows the Mass Maharaja fighting the goons in the Ravi Teja's style. The teaser confirms the movie is full of action sequences but has little punches of comedy every now and then. The dialogue also does not fail to impress the viewers. Big Dhamaka looks as promising as any other Ravi Teja movie. The teaser begins with Ravi Teja holding a bike's silencer as a weapon and looking dashing in his goggles.
