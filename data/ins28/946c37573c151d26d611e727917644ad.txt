Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a 25-year-old gun violence prevention advocate, first became involved in politics after 20 children and six adults were fatally shot at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.A decade later, Frost is a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination in Florida's Orlando-area 10th congressional district, and he's grappling once again with the implications of the country's most recent mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde, Texas."Just last week, I was at a vigil for the Buffalo shooting," Frost told Insider in a phone interview on Friday.
