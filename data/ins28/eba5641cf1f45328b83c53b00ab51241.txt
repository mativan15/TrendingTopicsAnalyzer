The Office of the Auditor General has revealed flaws in recordkeeping for Masterton's civic facility project decisions. This was confirmed in a statement released by the OAG on Thursday. The OAG said when Masterton District Council decided on June 26, 2019, to progress the option of a new civic facility to public consultation, it had received advice from the project's Steering Group not to proceed with the project at that time. At this stage, the council was considering options on the current town hall site.
