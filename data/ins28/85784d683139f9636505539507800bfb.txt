I recently read a letter from the business and energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, in which he tries to justify government plans to encourage investment in new North Sea oil and gas. He says it would 'protect Britain's energy security' and smooth the 'transition to cheap, clean, home-grown energy', as well as cutting energy bills.
