It's been a tough past few months for Nvidia (NVDA 5.16%) and its investors. Despite being swept higher in Thursday's broad bullishness, shares of the technology giant are still down by nearly half of their peak price hit in November. And the company just warned shareholders that revenue for the quarter now underway wouldn't be as healthy as analysts were initially anticipating.
Veteran investors know, however, that some of the market's biggest rewards come from buying shares of great companies while they're beaten down.
