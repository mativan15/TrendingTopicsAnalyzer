Conor McGregor wanted Liverpool to win the Champions League final despite being a Manchester United fan. Liverpool were defeated by Real Madrid in the competition's final last weekend thanks to a second-half goal from Brazilian forward Vinicius Jr. It was a tough loss to take for the Reds, who previously lost the same final to Madrid in 2018. McGregor has been a fan of United since a child and was pictured as a young boy wearing their kit. The UFC star revealed his family are big Liverpool supporters so he put aside the rivalry for one game by supporting the Reds against Madrid.
