It's easy to match the overall market return by buying an index fund. When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. Investors in JOANN Inc. (NASDAQ:JOAN) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 44%. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 12%. JOANN may have better days ahead, of course; we've only looked at a one year period. Furthermore, it's down 31% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.
