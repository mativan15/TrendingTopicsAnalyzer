Bruins forward A.J. Greer has all the makings of a fan favorite in Boston originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston

BOSTON -- A.J. Greer has the potential to quickly become a fan favorite in Boston, especially if he continues to play like he did for the Bruins in Saturday night's home opener at TD Garden.

Greer scored twice, picked up an assist, tallied four shots on net and played a physical style of hockey in Boston's 6-3 victory over the Arizona Coyotes.
