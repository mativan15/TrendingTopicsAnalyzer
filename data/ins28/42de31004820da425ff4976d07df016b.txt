The family of a man killed in a shooting outside a Queens nightclub believes the victim was killed by a stray bullet.

'He was in the wrong place at the wrong time,' the man's brother told the Daily News on Wednesday. 'They were shooting at somebody who ran by him and he caught a stray.'

Nicholas Mahabir, 23, was celebrating his belated birthday at Blend Lounge on Atlantic Ave. near 129th St. in Richmond Hill early Monday morning, his friends and family said.

The victim was involved in a late-night disagreement inside the club that spilled out onto the street, according to police.
