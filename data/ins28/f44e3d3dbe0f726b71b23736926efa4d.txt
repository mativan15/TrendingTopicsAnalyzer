El Paso's migrant bus program, which has flooded New York City with thousands of new border arrivals since August, could soon end, an official in the Texas city told The Post.
El Paso Deputy City Manager Mario D'Agostino said the Democrat-led border city may stop busing migrants to the Big Apple in light of the new Biden administration policy that would instead send asylum-seeking Venezuelans back to Mexico if they cross into the US illegally.
'We realize that we won't need the charters, so at the point, we will start handling it differently,' D'Agostino said.
