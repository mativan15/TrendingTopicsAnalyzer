(SBI) on Wednesday said it will endeavour to accelerate its digital agenda and forge partnerships with fintech firms and NBFCs to drive its business growth. Overall FY22 has been a much better year compared to the previous year as the pace of economic activity picked up, chairman Dinesh Khara said. The momentum is expected to continue, he said, adding opening up of the economy has reduced the need for a fresh stimulus package and the current momentum appears sustainable. Thus, for the bank, it is imperative that the business keeps adapting to the new operating environment, he said in his letter to shareholders published in the annual report for FY22.
