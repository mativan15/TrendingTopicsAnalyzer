The Karnataka High Court has quashed the September 14 order of a magistrate's court allowing the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) to obtain custody of five accused in the police sub-inspectors' (PSI) recruitment scam as part of a probe into a money laundering case registered by the ED in connection with the scam.
The high court has quashed the order granting permission to the ED to quiz D Harsha, an official who was working at the Karnataka police recruitment cell, and four others regarding the money involved in the recruitment scam, on the grounds that the ED should have approached a special court dealing with money laundering cases and not a magistrate's court.
