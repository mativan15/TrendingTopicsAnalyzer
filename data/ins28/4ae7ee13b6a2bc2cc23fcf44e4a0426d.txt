India expects rainfall in the biggest coal-producing areas of its east-central region to be below the long-term average this year, potentially easing utilities' coal shortages as there could be fewer disruptions to mining activity due to flooding. East-central India includes the states of Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal, which together account for nearly half of the country's annual coal output. Coal accounts for nearly 75% of India's power generation.
 India expects overall rainfall during the annual monsoon to be 103% of the long-term average.
