Last week, McDonald's Corporation's (NYSE:MCD) stock jumped 4.3%, but insiders who sold US$3.7m worth of stock in over the past year are likely to be in a better position. Selling at an average price of US$258, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.

While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
