There is good news and bad news for the government this morning.

The good news is that the financial markets have not taken further fright at the extraordinary political scenes of discord and chaos in the UK's governing party.

As Tony Danker of the CBI business lobby group said to me last week, "market stability is a pre-requisite for business investment - nothing happens if the government's borrowing costs (which affect all borrowing costs) are soaring".

Government bond yields (the interest rate the government has to pay to borrow) were stable this morning and are half a percent below the level seen in the aftermath of the disastrous mini-budget.
