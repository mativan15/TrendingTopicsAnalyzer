So what
A 2019 spinoff from chemicals company FMC, Livent isn't the world's biggest lithium producer, but it's a sizable "tier 2" kind of a company that did $420 million in sales last year -- but just barely broke even. As lithium prices have surged in 2022, however, Livent's profitability has grown by leaps and bounds, passing $53 million in the year's first quarter -- more than the company earned annually in four of the past five years, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
