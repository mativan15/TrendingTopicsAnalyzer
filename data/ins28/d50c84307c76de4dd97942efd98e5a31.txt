Pranksters snuck into the NRA convention to mock NRA leader Wayne LaPierre for offering 'thoughts and prayers' in response to mass shootings

Political pranksters trolled NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre at the NRA Convention.

'The Good Liars' sarcastically thanked LaPierre for his "thoughts and prayers" following mass shootings.

LaPierre was re-elected by the NRA Board as executive vice president on Monday in a 54-1 vote.

National Rifle Association leader Wayne LaPierre appeared to be unknowingly trolled by political pranksters at the NRA Convention in Houston on Saturday.
