By Reuters Published: 10:13 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 10:13 EDT, 2 June 2022 PARIS, June 2 (Reuters) - Matines, the egg business of French agri-food group Avril supplying 16% of eggs sold in French supermarkets, is winding down its loss-making activities after failing to find a buyer, potentially resulting in 114 job cuts, it said on Thursday. A surge in grain prices - the main cost for feeding laying hens - strong competition and difficulty in passing on rising costs to clients were among the main reasons for the company's recurrent losses over the past years, a Matines spokesperson said.
