dima_zel Overview I believe Virgin Orbit Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:VORB) is grossly undervalued. My thoughts are that there are strong tailwinds to support VORB's expected growth over the coming decade. It is true that there are risks associated with VORB today given they are not generating meaningful revenue or profits, but their strong execution history gives comfort that they will be able to meet guidance. Business description VORB is a vertically integrated company engaged in providing small satellite launch capabilities.
