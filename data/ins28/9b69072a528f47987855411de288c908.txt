Mike Pence's detractors walked out on him while he was in the middle of delivering prepared remarks during a conservative event at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. on Wednesday.The walk-out happened around the 25-minute mark when Pence repeated his opinion that big corporations, media, and the government are conspiring against the freedom of Americans."It seems like every day a new story breaks that says big media, big government, big tech or big business have locked arms to advance a woke agenda designed to advance the policies and beliefs of the American left, and show intolerance to people that have divergent views," Pence said.
