A California woman found US$36,000 hidden in the cushions of a couch she got for free off of Craigslist, but what she decided to do with the money has people divided.
Vicky Umodu, who lives in San Bernardino County, told ABC News she'd just moved into a new place and scored a set of free sofas from a nearby family who was liquidating the estate of a relative who had recently died.She said she was inspecting the new-to-her furniture when she came across something that felt like a heating pad inside one of the cushions.
