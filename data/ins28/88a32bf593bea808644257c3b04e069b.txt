Love Island 2022 star Tasha Ghouri will donate half of her winnings to a deaf charity should she be crowned this year's winner.
The 23-year-old model and dancer is among the first batch of sexy singletons headed into the Majorcan villa for series eight and is set to make history as the show's first-ever contestant with impaired hearing.
Should Tasha manage to storm the show and take home the £50,000, she wants to help a charity close to her heart.
‘If I did win the prize money, it would be a shock,' she said.
