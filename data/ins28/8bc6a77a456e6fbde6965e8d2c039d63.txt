The Supreme Court Friday asked governments of NCT of Delhi, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh to take suo motu action against any hate speech crimes taking place within their jurisdiction, without even waiting for any complaint. Noting that 'the Constitution of India envisages a secular nation and fraternity among citizens assuring the dignity of the individual', the apex court bench, comprising Justices KM Joseph and Hrishikesh Roy, directed the three governments to furnish a report before the court regarding the actions taken against those indulging in hate crimes within their jurisdiction.
