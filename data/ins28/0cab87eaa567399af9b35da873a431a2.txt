Emergency? What emergency?

How fast we forget just how slow we were to end the occupation of our national capital. And the blockading of our national borders.

Remember when the convoy converged on Ottawa to ransom its residents, making their lives miserable for the sin of trying to save lives in a pandemic? Recall when scofflaws blocked international bridges in order to bring our economy to its knees (and bring down a recently elected government)?

Those memories are being relegated to revisionist history as we begin the blame game of who didn't do what when.
