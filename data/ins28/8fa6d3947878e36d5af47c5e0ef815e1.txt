Germany is set to make a "quantum leap" by approving a massive military fund on Friday. MPs are expected to approve €100 billion of spending to strengthen German forces with a huge procurement drive. The move, which is expected to be widely supported in the Bundestag, was prompted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Chancellor Olaf Scholz described the spending spree as a 'quantum leap" that would be greeted with "relief" in capitals across Europe. "Finally, they say, Germany is taking on the security policy responsibility that it has in the 21st century,' he said.
