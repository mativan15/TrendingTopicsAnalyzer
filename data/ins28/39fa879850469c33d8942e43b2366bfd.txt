Jun. 1—NEWBERRY COUNTY — Newberry County Council approved a request from Newberry Electric Cooperative for $92,000 (from ARPA funds) for a 50/50 matching grant to expand broadband, with contingencies.

"We wanted to come and present an opportunity that came our way. We have an initiative to get broadband fiber, high-speed internet, into the county, which is a huge undertaking. For us, it was going to be a $22 million project to start with," said Keith Avery, CEO of the coop.

Stephanie Sullivan, vice president of Operational Support, presented the plan to council.
