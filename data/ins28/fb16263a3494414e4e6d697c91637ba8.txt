After starting all of the Magpies' first four games of the Premier League season, a hip injury put the keeper out of action.
And after heading to the South coast, Woodman was disappointed not to get a minute of Championship action.
Now North End are keen to take him — although that would mean them having to guarantee him game time to get approval from the Toon.
