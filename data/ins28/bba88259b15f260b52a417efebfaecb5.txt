Netherlands made heavy weather of a small target before eking out a five-wicket win over Namibia to register their second consecutive victory in the T20 World Cup here on Tuesday.
Netherlands dished out a fine bowling effort to restrict Namibia to 121 for six before taking the game deep. They completed the task in 19.3 overs in their first round Group A match. Sitting pretty at 92 for one, Netherlands made a harakiri towards the end to allow Namibia to make a comeback. Vikramjit Singh (39 off 31) and Max O'Dowd (35 off 35) got Netherlands' chase off to a blazing start, sharing 59 runs for the opening wicket.
