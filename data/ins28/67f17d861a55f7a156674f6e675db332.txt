The cost-of-living 'tsunami' is set to sweep National into power at the 2023 election, according to leader Christopher Luxon. Speaking at the National Party Central North Island conference in Hamilton on Saturday, Luxon told the audience 'the cost of living crisis, that's how we'll win this election'. 'We have reset the party. We are ready to lead the country, we are ready to win,' he said. '[The] cost-of-living tsunami is making jumping over the ditch more attractive every day.'National leader Christopher Luxon said the Labour Government was out of energy, and ideas, and that the reset National party was ready to govern.
