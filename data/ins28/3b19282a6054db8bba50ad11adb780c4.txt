sturti/E+ via Getty Images Canadian Apartment Properties REIT (OTC:CDPYF, TSX:CAR.UN), which is more fondly known as CAPREIT, is the largest multi-residential REIT on the TSX. The over-the-counter version of the stock has too low a trading volume. So, it would defeat the purpose of investing in the asset class of stocks that are advantageous for their liquidity. Therefore, interested investors should invest on the TSX, where the trading volume is about 257x higher with an average volume of 565,625.
