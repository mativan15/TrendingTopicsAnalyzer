French rail, energy and other key workers are striking on Tuesday to demand a bigger share of corporate profits, raising pressure on President Emmanuel Macron to take further steps to ease the impact of surging inflation.

Commuters face travel disruption on regional trains and buses, while some Eurostar services between Paris and London have been canceled. The CGT union has also asked port workers to hold stoppages for several hours.
