Savusia Konstantin/iStock Editorial via Getty Images BlackBerry stock (NYSE:BB) has jumped 6.7% in response to a partnership with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on its Chrome operating system and browser. The companies have launched Chrome Enterprise Management with BlackBerry UEM (Unified Endpoint Management) - offering BlackBerry's UEM support for the range of devices running the Chrome OS and browser. That boosts BlackBerry UEM's Serviceable Available Market, the companies say, and the integration is featured on Google's Chrome Enterprise Recommended program.
