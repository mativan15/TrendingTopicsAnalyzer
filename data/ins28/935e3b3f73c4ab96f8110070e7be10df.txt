President Biden on Thursday said John Fetterman's wife Gisele would make a 'great lady in the Senate' in an awkward stumble amid questions over the Senate candidate's health after a stroke.

'John, thank you very much for running, I really do appreciate it,' Mr. Biden said at an event in Pittsburgh. 'And Gisele, you're going to be a great, great lady in the Senate.'

Mr. Fetterman, who is in a tight race for Pennsylvania's open seat in the U.S. Senate against Republican Mehmet Oz, has come under increasing scrutiny since a stroke left him with auditory processing issues and raised questions about his ability to hold office.
