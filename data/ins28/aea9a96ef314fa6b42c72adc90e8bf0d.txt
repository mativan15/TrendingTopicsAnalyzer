Liz Truss announced her resignation on October 20 2022, 44 days after taking office. The departure makes her the UK's shortest-serving prime minister. But who did she replace to earn this undesirable accolade?

The previous holder of this title was George Canning, who lasted more than twice as long as Truss. He died in office after a premiership of 119 days. Known by many as the 'lost leader' because of his short tenure, Canning still left his mark on British political history. He is one of only four prime ministers to have a statue in Parliament Square, the others being Benjamin Disraeli, David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill.
