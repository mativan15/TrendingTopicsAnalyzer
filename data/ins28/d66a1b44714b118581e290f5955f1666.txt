Jinx Tea, Folly Coffee join forces

Coffee lovers and tea lovers now have common ground at the Folly Coffee Cafe & Jinx Tea Bar. Now open in Minneapolis' Linden Hills neighborhood, the space at 4503 France Av. S. was a standalone Jinx Tea Bar before closing temporarily to renovate for the new joint venture. The menu highlights both local companies. Jinx serves iced teas, bubble teas, nitro-infused teas, carbonated teas and more, while the Folly menu features its fruit-forward house bean, single-origin espressos, lattes, cappuccinos and more.
