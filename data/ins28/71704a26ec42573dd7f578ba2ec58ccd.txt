The 2022 NCAA Tournament field was revealed Monday morning where it was announced the Arizona baseball team will be headed to the Coral Gables Regional hosted by Miami. They will also be joined by Canisius and a familiar foe in Ole Miss. Arizona manager Chip Hale called the Wildcats "road warriors" this season in response to being asked about traveling to Florida to begin what they hope to be the start of the road back to Omaha.  "This is probably the most this school has traveled in a long time," Hale said.
