Amber Davies received some strong words of advice from country music icon Dolly Parton when it comes to avoiding men – but now she's all loved up with her co-star.
The musical theatre graduate was catapulted to fame when she won Love Island in 2017, dating Kem Cetinay at the time.
And the former reality star has had quite the career overhaul since, as she's now a West End star in her own right with acting credits including musicals 9 to 5 and, most recently, Back to the Future.
