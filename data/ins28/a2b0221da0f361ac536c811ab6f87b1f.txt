A new competition to find future female tech stars has awarded its first set of prizes for ideas including a software system which tackles paper waste in schools and an app to make it easier to learn foreign languages.

Girls aged 16-18 from across England were invited to submit their ideas on how technology can be used to improve schools and education as part of the TechGirl 2023 competition.

They were encouraged to think critically about their own school experience to identify an important challenge facing the education system, and to think creatively about how technology can be used to solve that problem.
