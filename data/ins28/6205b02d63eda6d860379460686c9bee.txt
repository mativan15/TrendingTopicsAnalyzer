The establishment, Shoreline Seafood Inc., sold party platters and carryout meals. Chefs cooked up everything from crabs and fish to oysters and scallops. Specials included shrimp, tuna and chicken salad sandwiches. The main entrance is shaped like a lighthouse, honoring the nautical nature of the business. That rotunda still overlooks the neighboring Waugh Chapel Towne Centre, but a hand-written note on the door announced the closure.
