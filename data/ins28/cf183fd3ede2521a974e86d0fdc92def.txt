It's been 50 years since the first Mack truck roared off the assembly line in Palmerston North, a milestone fans of the iconic brand intend to celebrate en masse at Manfeild. Almost 180 Macks, comprising models from throughout the decades, are to be displayed at a special show on Saturday. The Mack Trucks 50 Year Celebration Truck Show is being held in conjunction with the Manawatū Car Club Octoberfest event. Sime Darby Motors senior marketing executive Adam Crawford said people who attended would also be able to watch car and truck races on the Manfeild track.
