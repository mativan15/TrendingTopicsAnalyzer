The maker of the Snapchat app said third-quarter sales increased 6% to $1.13 billion. That was just shy of analysts' average estimate of $1.14 billion, according to projections compiled by Bloomberg.

The social media company spent the quarter shrinking and refocusing its business, announcing in August that it was cutting 20% of its workforce and slashing projects that don't contribute to ​​user or revenue growth, or to the company's augmented reality efforts.
