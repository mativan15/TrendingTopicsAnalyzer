The videos of KK feeling uneasy and sweating profusely during his live performance are all over the social media. The concert was overcrowded and that has raised many questions. "Do the security guards/police/organisers of the show realise what they did by allowing so many people inside an auditorium meant for 2000 people? Will the authorities of Nazrul Mancha now please wake up?" wrote Rupsha Dasgupta who works for Fossils, a rock band based in Kolkata.    TwitterArmaan Malik has also stated that concerts in India need better management.
