(Patch Media)Hello, my people. It's me again, Simone, your regular host of the Healdsburg Daily. Happy to be back! Hope everyone had a wild and wonderful Memorial Day and Future Farmers weekend in our beautiful bumpkin town. I'm still getting caught up on everything that happened over the past week or so, while I was out, but here's a quick look at all the most important stuff you need to know right now. Enjoy... First, your daily weather: Tuesday: Clear, sunny and hot. High: 86 Low: 49. Wednesday: Partly sunny and even hotter.
