The City of Toronto was overbilled by hotel operators by nearly $15 million on its emergency program to shelter the homeless in hotels around the city over the past two years, the auditor general says in a new report. Toronto Auditor General Beverly Romeo-Beehler says that as the city moved to rapidly expand its housing operations in hotels at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was charged by a hotel owner for things it specifically was not responsible for according to its contract but paid out the money anyway.
