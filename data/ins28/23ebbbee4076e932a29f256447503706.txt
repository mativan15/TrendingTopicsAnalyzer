Russia's Gazprombank opened a special rupee account with state-owned UCO Bank, paving the way for bilateral trades between Moscow and New Delhi, two people familiar with the matter told ET. The move would help increase imports of cheaper oil from Russia. Earlier, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) came out with a bespoke special rupee account for bilateral trades between rupee and any other currencies besides the US dollar. Gazprombank is only facing sectoral sanctions, but is not under the Specially Designated Nationals, or SDN, sanctions.
