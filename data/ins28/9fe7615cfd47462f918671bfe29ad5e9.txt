Trump Media & Technology Group, the company behind former President Donald Trump's social media app Truth Social, recently laid out their plans for a new 'non-woke' streaming service called TMTG+. The subscription-based streaming service is set to be a "non-woke alternative to the programs offered by streaming services" like Netflix and Disney+. However, it will not " insist that programming push some particular political ideology," according to an SEC filing from Digital World Acquisition Corp, a SPAC or "blank check" firm, set to merge with TMTG.
