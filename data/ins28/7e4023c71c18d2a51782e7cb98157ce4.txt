If there's a phrase in English that has really gone off the rails and needs to be shunted back into the yard, it has to be 'Throwing him under the bus'. For starters, no one ever makes the threat, 'I'll throw you under the bus!' simply because causing harm to someone to gain advantage shows the thrower in very poor light. Instead, the phrase is used - and overused - to describe a third party. And barring the criminally minded - like the family in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, earlier this month, which 'punished' a young man for eloping with a girl by pushing him in front of an approaching bus - no one actually does the dastardly deed since buses ply in crowded areas with witnesses galore.
