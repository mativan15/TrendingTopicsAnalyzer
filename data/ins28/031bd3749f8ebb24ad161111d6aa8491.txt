AgenciesClimate activists promised to carry out protests every day in London in October. Members of the group "Just Stop Oil" blocked Park Lane today and painted an Aston Martin showroom orange with spray paint. Chloe Thomas, a 19-year-old pregnant campaigner, said they were on the road demanding no new oil. Chloe Thomas asked how she would explain to her child in the upcoming years when she asked where the beauty, the animals, and the culture were. She said it was bad and as parents, children, humans, and citizens, it is their responsibility to protect those they love and themselves.
