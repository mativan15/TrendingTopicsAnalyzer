A recent front running episode which has come to light at a well-known mutual fund is one more addition to the long list of white collar crimes that have occurred in India in last couple of decades. The stars in the list include Harshad Mehta, Satyam, Ketan Parekh, Saradha Chit fund, PMC bank and Punjab National Bank.  
The sociologists and criminologists define white collar crime as 'crime committed by people who enjoy the high social status, great repute, and respectability in their occupation'.
