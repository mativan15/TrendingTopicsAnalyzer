Joni Mitchell is set to return to the stage for her first headline concert in 23 years, singer Brandi Carlile confirmed. 
The 78-year-old musician has not performed her own headline shows in over two decades, but had taken the stage with Brandi earlier this year at the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island.
Brandi confirmed that the music legend has been inspired to perform on June 10, 2023 at the Gorge Amphitheatre in Washington, telling the Daily Show on Wednesday: ‘I can't believe it's happening, but it's happening and she is going to crush it.
