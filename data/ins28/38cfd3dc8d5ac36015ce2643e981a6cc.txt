Last month, a manager at a Dollar Tree store in Indiana posted a sign on the door of the business, which read as follows: "I apologize for closing AGAIN. My 2 new cashiers quit because I said their boyfriends couldn't stand here for their entire shift!! Don't hire Gen Zs. They don't know what work actually means. NOW HIRING! Baby Boomers ONLY. Thanks!"

We then compiled a list of stereotypical complaints that older generations tend to make about Gen Z's work ethic. In the comments, over 200 people from the BuzzFeed Community came to Gen Z's defense.
