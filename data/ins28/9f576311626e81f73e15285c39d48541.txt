May 31—Malachi Smith, considered one of the top players in the transfer portal, apparently is taking a close look at Gonzaga.

Smith, who led Chattanooga in scoring, assists and steals while earning Southern Conference Most Valuable Player honors, is considering Gonzaga and Texas Tech, but On3 recruiting analyst Jamie Shaw projected the Zags as the favorite with 75% confidence. On3's recruiting prediction machine listed GU as Smith's future destination at 99.9%. Those projections were made prior to guard Rasir Bolton's announcement Tuesday that he is returning to Gonzaga next season.
