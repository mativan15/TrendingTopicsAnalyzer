The explosive series of events that led to the departure of Suella Braverman began yesterday morning with a simple mistake.The home secretary had been deeply concerned about government plans to relax immigration restrictions as part of Liz Truss's attempts to drive growth. After a heated confrontation with the prime minister about the policy on Tuesday evening she wanted to enlist the support of her Eurosceptic base in fighting the measures.She emailed Sir John Hayes, a former security minister and one of her biggest champions, a draft ministerial statement detailing the policy and asking for his opinion on it.
