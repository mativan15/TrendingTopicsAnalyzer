Polling guru Professor Sir John Curtice has claimed it will be 'very difficult to recover' from the calamitous premiership of Liz Truss for the Conservative Party as the idea that they 'can run the economy' has been 'tarnished'. Speaking to LBC's Nick Ferrari, Sir John said that, though a recovery 'of sorts' was possible, history suggests that 'if the government gets into a fiscal crisis, it usually loses at the next general election'. He claimed it was because 'voters do not forget' such difficulty even if there is a period of time lapsed between the collapse of a government and the markets, and another general election.
