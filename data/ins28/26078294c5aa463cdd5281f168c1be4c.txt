A 19-unit townhome complex in Lebanon has traded hands for $5.2 million, according to Wilson County records.

The buyer, BAF 2 LLC, appears to be affiliated with Austin, Texas-based Amherst Holdings, a real estate investment and development firm. The company could not be immediately reached for comment.

Florida-based Dreamstone Investments bought the 1.7-acre lot on Hartsville Court in November 2020 for $1.2 million, county records show.

The sale was facilitated by Matthews Real Estate Investment Services President Austin Graham and associate Austin Tomaiko, according to a news release.
