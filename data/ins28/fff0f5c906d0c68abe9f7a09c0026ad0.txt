Indian military establishments have been a preferred choice for the Sri Lankan army in producing leaders of the island nation's Armed forces, the Indian High Commission here said on Friday. "Annually, 1,500-1,700 slots are allocated to Sri Lankan trainees which amount to around INR 500-550 million (more than USD 6 million). Similarly, officers of the Indian armed forces are also hosted by the friendly armed forces of Sri Lanka, including for specialised (operations)," the Indian mission said in statement.
