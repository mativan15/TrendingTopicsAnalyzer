Hungary has issued a condemnation of EU sanctions against Russia, posting an image on its official government Facebook page likening the economic measures to a bomb and warning that Brussels' financial warfare against Moscow will 'destroy' Budapest.The graphic, which features a warhead emblazoned with the Hungarian word for 'sanctions' and the message 'Brussels sanctions will destroy us,' was added on Saturday to accompany the government's latest national consultation survey, which asked citizens whether they agreed with Budapest's stated opposition to EU sanctions on Russia.
