harmpeti/iStock via Getty Images Investment Thesis Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) had lost 78.8% of its value, given the continuous downwards slide since November 2021. Since other Metaverse related stocks, including Meta (FB) and Matterport (MTTR), have also massively declined in the past six months, it is apparent that the party is over for now, though the former is mainly attributed to its reduced profitability from the Apple (AAPL)'s headwinds. In addition, stock recovery will not be soon, given its lack of profitability, the overly bearish market, and global macro conditions.
