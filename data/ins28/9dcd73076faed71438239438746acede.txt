Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Monday, with the U.K. outperforming, following the news that the new Chancellor will bring forward the announcement of his fiscal plans to shore up market confidence after weeks of turmoil.

By 03:40 ET (07:40 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%, and U.K.'s FTSE 100 climbed 0.3%.

New British finance minister Jeremy Hunt will announce tax and spending measures later Monday, two weeks earlier than previously scheduled, after the original economic plan put forward by Prime Minister Liz Truss and former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng roiled financial markets.
