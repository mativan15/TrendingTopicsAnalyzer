The long-running debate over where to build a new arena in Greater Sudbury will start all over again with the election of a new mayor and city council on Oct. 24. In 2017, council selected the proposed Kingsway Entertainment District over a site in downtown Sudbury, setting off years of legal challenges and divisive discussion in the community.That chapter closed in July when city council rejected the $215 million price tag for building a new event centre on the Kingsway."I think we need an arena," said Paul Lefebvre, a former Liberal MP now running for mayor.
