Over the past two years, Yasmin Curtis has operated her Chicago restaurant at varying levels: Closed. Open for delivery. Limited capacity. Closed. Open. City and state restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic determined her business hours. "You never recognized how you missed the noise until it was completely gone," Curtis told Insider. "At one point, we were closed for four months straight and then they would allow us to open at 25% capacity." Given the unpredictability, Curtis knew she needed a more reliable form of income than the foot traffic at Two Fish Crab Shack, the seafood restaurant she opened in 2016.
