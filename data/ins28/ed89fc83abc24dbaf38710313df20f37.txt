US retail investors slowed the pace of their stock purchases following another hot inflation report that inspired huge equity swings, but a sustainable bear-market rally could revive their appetite to buy, Vanda Research said Wednesday. The firm in a weekly update said bearishness among individual investors was at its highest since June. Average daily net inflows of $938 million a day over the last five trading days have been sharply lower than the year-to-date average. Daily net inflows on average tend to top more than $1 billion.
