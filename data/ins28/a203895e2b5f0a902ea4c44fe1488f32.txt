The recent quarterly revenue miss and reduced 2022 sales guidance have added to the short-term pain for the company's shares with the stock now trading 38% below its IPO price. For patient investors, they could potentially enjoy "long-term gains" by considering TDCX as an investment candidate, as TDCX's current valuation multiples are reasonably attractive, and the company still has a long growth runway ahead.
