Frank Lampard believes a fit-again Dominic Calvert-Lewin will help Everton address the lack of goals and creativity that has hindered his team this season.The England international, 25, made his first start of the campaign at Newcastle on Wednesday, when Everton suffered a third successive Premier League defeat. Lampard's team did not have a shot on target at St James' Park, or in last weekend's defeat at Tottenham, and the manager admits they must improve in the final third after scoring eight goals in 11 league games.
