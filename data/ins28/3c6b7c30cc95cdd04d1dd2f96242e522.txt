If you buy and hold a stock for many years, you'd hope to be making a profit. But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Spin Master Corp. (TSE:TOY) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 16% over five years, which is below the market return. Over the last twelve months the stock price has risen a very respectable 11%.

After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals.
