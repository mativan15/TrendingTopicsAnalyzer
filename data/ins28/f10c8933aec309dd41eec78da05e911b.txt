A view of the Parliament House in Singapore May 24, 2018. 
Singapore's government filed bills in parliament on Thursday seeking to decriminalise sex between men, and to amend the constitution to prevent court challenges to laws and policies concerning marriage.The proposed legislation in socially conservative Singapore follows Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's announcement in August of a plan to repeal Section 377A of its penal code, a legacy of British colonial rule and not used in decades, which carries punishments of up to two years in jail for sex between men.
