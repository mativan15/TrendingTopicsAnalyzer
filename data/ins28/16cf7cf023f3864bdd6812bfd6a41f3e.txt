For the last five years, the Los Angeles Rams have primarily been built around an explosive offense that carries the team into the playoffs. That wasn't the case in 2020 and it hasn't been this year, but Sean McVay is an offensive genius who ranks among the best coaches in the NFL.
This season, the defense has been absolutely dominant, better than the team's 3-3 record reflects. Statistically, the Rams rank sixth in yards allowed, first in first downs allowed and second in red zone defense. In the last four games, the defense has allowed 12 points, 17 points, 15 points and 3 points, excluding any points scored by the opponent's defense.
