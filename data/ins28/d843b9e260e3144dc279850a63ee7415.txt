Jun. 5—By March 1, all Hamilton tobacco retailers will be required to obtain a license to sell the product within the city limits, if proposed legislation is approved this week.

Hamilton City Council is to consider legislation at its Wednesday meeting that would create the Tobacco Retail License at an annual cost of $250 per seller. The primary objective is to ensure tobacco retailers are not selling these products, and the accessories to the projects, to those under 21, said Hamilton Planning Director Liz Hayden.
