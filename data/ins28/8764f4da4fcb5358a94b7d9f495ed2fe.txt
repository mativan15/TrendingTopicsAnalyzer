Olga 'Bo' Thorp, one of the founders of Fayetteville's Cape Fear Regional Theatre and a driving force in the city's arts community, died on Friday. She was 89.

With Thorp, the Fayetteville Little Theater that she, her husband Herb, and their theatrical friends co-founded in 1962 as a community theater for local actors grew over the next 50 years into the Cape Fear Regional Theatre. The venue and organization at the top of Haymount Hill is a place for amateur thespians to perform with entertainment industry talent hired from around the country, and for audiences regularly enjoy professional-level productions.
