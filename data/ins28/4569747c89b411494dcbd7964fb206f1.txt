Eve the kelpie was only eight weeks old when Chris Stapleton realised his newest little dog was something special. 'She went around the sheep, and started working the first time she saw sheep,' the sheep and cattle farmer from Newbridge, in NSW Australia, said. 'She just had a lot of natural instincts. I've trained her since she was a little puppy and she has ticked all the boxes along the way.' Stapleton's own instincts proved correct on Thursday, when the kelpie – officially called Capree Eve – sold under the hammer for A$49,000 (NZ$54,200) at a combined online and in-person auction, marking her out as the most expensive kelpie in Australia.
