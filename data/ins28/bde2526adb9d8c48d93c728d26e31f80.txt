A west-end Toronto public housing complex was in a critical state of repair and 'falling well short' of targets the last time it was assessed before a ceiling collapse on Friday left a person hospitalized.The early morning incident took place in a two-storey lower-level townhouse in the Swansea Mews community near High Park, Toronto Community Housing says. The rest of the block — which has 14 units, 11 of which were tenanted — was then evacuated for an inspection by city engineers, it added.As those tenants remain in hotels, awaiting an update on the inspection that TCH expects to deliver by Wednesday, local councillor Gord Perks described the collapse as a blow to a community that has long struggled with disrepair, and was finally on the cusp of a site renewal.
