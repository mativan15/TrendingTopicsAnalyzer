Shocking video shows an armed 12-year-old boy robbing a Michigan gas station and firing a shot when the confused clerk asks 'are you serious?'
The boy told cops 'he didn't do it for the money' after he was arrested after the brazen, broad daylight stick-up at 4 p.m. Wednesday at Marathon gas station in Hartford.
'He said he would've thrown the money into the sewer. He wouldn't give us an explanation why he did it,' Lt. Mike Prince told TV station WZZM 13.
The child can be seen in the video waiting in line behind another customer at the counter before he approaches the clerk and demands she hand over the cash.
