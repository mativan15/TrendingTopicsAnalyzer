Eight out of 10 people in Britain now disapprove of the government, a YouGov poll showed on Oct. 18, as the country deals with an economic crisis inflamed by new Prime Minister Liz Truss's now-abandoned attempts at radical tax cutting reforms.　The poll found that 77 percent Britons disapproved of the Conservative-led government, the highest in 11 years of YouGov tracking, the company said.　YouGov also said that 9 in 10 Britons, or 87 percent of those polled, say the government is handling the economy badly, in a blow to the party that has historically talked up its record for fiscal discipline.
