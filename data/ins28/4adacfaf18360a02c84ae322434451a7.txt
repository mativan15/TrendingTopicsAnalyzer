The Mets' rotation didn't get any younger this season.
In a win-now mode, the team last November added Max Scherzer, who turned 38 in July, and also featured the 35-year-old Carlos Carrasco and Jacob deGrom, who turned 34 in June. Chris Bassitt, who arrived in a trade from the A's, turned 33 before the season.
It's a fact team brass will have to weigh heavily this offseason. Mostly, that pertains to deGrom — and also to Carrasco and Bassitt — as the Mets consider how to rebuild a rotation that was strong for most of the season, but faded in the final weeks as the Mets squandered their NL East title chances and lost to the Padres in the wild-card series.
