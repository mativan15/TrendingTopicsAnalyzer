BOSTON–The Philadelphia 76ers made moves in the offseason in order to help bolster the bench unit and improve the depth surrounding their star duo of Joel Embiid and James Harden. On paper, they look like great moves, but they struggled on opening night.
The Sixers fell in the season opener 126-117 to the Boston Celtics on the road. Philadelphia only received 11 bench points, five from De'Anthony Melton, and they weren't able to give the starters the boost they needed.
100 of Philadelphia's 117 points came from Harden, Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, and Tobias Harris and the Sixers needed more help than that.
