Apple could launch the new iPad Pro with the updated M2 chip tonight, suggests latest leak.
 October is usually the month when Apple launches a new Mac or an iPad. The tradition could continue tonight but not in the same way as before. If the latest leak has an ounce of truth, Apple could quietly announce the new iPad Pro models tonight. Yes, the new iPad Pro launch for later tonight. However, the only update to the iPad Pro is likely to be the chipset and Apple may not host a separate launch event for it.
