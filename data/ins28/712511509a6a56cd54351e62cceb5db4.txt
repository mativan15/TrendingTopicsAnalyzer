Official data show that applications for work visas from migrants outside the EU are running at 58 per cent higher than what the Government forecast for post-Brexit.
Internal Home Office modelling suggested Boris Johnson's new immigration points system would lead to work visa applications from individual non-EU workers would rise from 35,000 a year to just over 60,000 a year.
However, Home Office data for the year to June 2022 show that, in fact, it has risen to 95,000. This has been largely fuelled by the NHS and social care recruiting to plug staff shortages.
