Russia has lashed out at Britain's ‘opulent' celebrations to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee.
A Moscow state television broadcast suggested events to honour Her Majesty's 70-year reign were an attempt to mask a country in decline – claiming living standards have slipped due to sanctions imposed against Vladimir Putin over his war with Ukraine.
The Queen, 96, had overseen the ‘final collapse' of the British Empire, the evening news on Kremlin-controlled channel, Rossiya-1, broadcast in a report from London.
