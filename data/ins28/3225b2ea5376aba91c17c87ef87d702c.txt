Online auto auction company Copart (Nasdaq: CPRT) paid $24 million to buy out the landlord of its facility in Opa-Locka.

The 17.3-acre auto lot at 12850 N.W. 27th Ave. was sold by 12850 N.W. 27th Avenue GP, managed by William R. Ekasala in Sarasota. It has a 4,731-square-foot building but it's mostly used for storage vehicles.

The price equated to $1.39 million per acre. Buying out its landlord should save on the expense of leasing, and ensure the landlord doesn't sell the property to an industrial or multifamily developer.
