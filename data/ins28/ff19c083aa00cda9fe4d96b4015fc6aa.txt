Warren Buffett bought nearly $5 billion worth of HP shares ⁠— here's why you might want to ride his coattails

Warren Buffett isn't known for being a technology investor.

In his 2014 letter to shareholders, Buffett wrote that he prefers 'simple businesses' and added that 'if there's lots of technology, we won't understand it.'

But in recent years, the Oracle of Omaha has warmed up a bit to the tech space. His holding company Berkshire Hathaway started buying Apple in 2016. Now the iPhone giant is the largest public holding in its portfolio.
