For all the criticism the Chicago Bears have received this offseason — particularly with how they've handled Justin Fields — they haven't had a terrible offseason. It hasn't been spectacular, but it hasn't been bad either.
Which is a sentiment shared by ESPN's Bill Barnwell, who ranked the Bears near the middle-of-the-pack when it comes to overall offseasons in the NFL. He ranked the Bears 23rd in the league, which sounds about right, all things considered.
Barnwell noted new general manager Ryan Poles came into an impossible situation, where he had to rebuild the roster and had just five draft picks when he arrived.
