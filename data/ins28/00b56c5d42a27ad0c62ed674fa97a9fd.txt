Over 50 physical training instructors (PTI) demanding government jobs and members of farmers' unions supporting them blocked traffic on Airport Road near Sohana for around seven hours during a protest on Sunday. The road remained blocked from both sides from 10 am to 7 pm.The traffic was seen moving at snail's pace and many commuters were forced to take diversions, which further added to traffic chaos. 'I had to reach Zirakpur for some important work, but I am waiting to find a way to at least take a diversion,' said Sandeep Malhotra, a commuter who was stuck in traffic jam.
