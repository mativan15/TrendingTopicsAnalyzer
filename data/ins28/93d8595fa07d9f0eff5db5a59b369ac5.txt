Cavaliers All-Star point guard Darius Garland left Wednesday's season-opening loss at Toronto in the second quarter after injuring his left eye in a collision with Raptors guard Gary Trent. Jr.

Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Garland was bleeding from a cut inside the left eyelid after Trent accidentally poked Garland in the eye with 3:51 to play in the first half.

Garland received attention on the court before returning to the locker room for treatment.

'His head was clear and all those things, but he was cut and bleeding pretty bad from the inside of his eyelid,' Bickerstaff said.
