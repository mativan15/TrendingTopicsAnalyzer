Nicola Sturgeon insists that spending £20 million of taxpayers' cash on a second independence referendum is a 'really good investment'. Well, she should know: her ability to spot a good investment speaks for itself.There's the circa £300 million she 'invested' in those still-unbuilt CalMac ferries, and the £586 million she put up to expand Sanjeev Gupta's jobless business empire in Scotland — an intervention that is at long last being investigated by the UK audit watchdog. That guarantee, later creatively repackaged by Gupta into a bond, was supposed to deliver 2,000 jobs at the Lochaber smelter and adjacent hydro-power plant at Fort William, but fewer than 50 were created.
