A solid showing in the SEC Tournament was not enough for Alabama Baseball to land a spot in the NCAA Tournament.
Alabama hoped that making a deep run in Hoover, which included wins over two NCAA Tournament teams in Georgia and Arkansas, would help their stock rise in the eyes of the selection committee. But, as the final name was announced during the Selection Special on ESPN, Alabama did not see its name in the bracket.
