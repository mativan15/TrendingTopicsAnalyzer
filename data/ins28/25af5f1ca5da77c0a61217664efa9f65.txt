BBuilder/iStock via Getty Images Looking at the capital markets action this week, credit spreads improved, the US dollar fell (as measured by the UUP), the 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields haven't made new highs in weeks, the PCE deflator data came in as expected, and lower year-over-year, and stocks bounced sharply. This week's returns: UUP: -1.38% HYG: +4.81% JNK: +4.87% AGG: +0.94% SPY: +6.59% Nasdaq Comp: +6.8% QQQ: +7.07% You could call this week just a huge reversal of the 7-8 week trends.
