If you're a college football fan, you know you have every Saturday morning marked down to watch ESPN's College GameDay as you get ready for that day's games.
And it's always fun to see where the show travels to during the season, with rabid fanbases designing wild signs to root on their team and troll others, and to see who Lee Corso will pick with which headgear to put on.
If you're here, you're probably wondering: Where is GameDay this week?
The answer: They're in in Eugene, Oregon in Week 8. The Ducks will host UCLA on Saturday in a battle of top-10 teams.
