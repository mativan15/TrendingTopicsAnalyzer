The Latino Chamber of Commerce Minnesota has announced the winners of this year's Latino Business Awards.

The winners were presented with the awards at an event held Tuesday at Granada Theater in Minneapolis. The second-annual awards are intended to recognize successful Latinos in business who have contributed to the community.

To be selected, winners were first nominated by members of the public, then voted on by a panel of judges. Nominees did not have to be members of the Chamber, Fabio Tenorio, executive director of the Latino Chamber Minnesota, told the Business Journal.
