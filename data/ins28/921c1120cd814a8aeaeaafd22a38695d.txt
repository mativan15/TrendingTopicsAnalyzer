Before the season, Mark Stuffel announced this would be his last as Nansemond River's baseball coach.

So when Stuffel, now in his 22nd season, got ejected in the fourth inning of the Class 5 Region A semifinal game against Maury, his players knew they couldn't let their coach go out like that.

The Warriors kept Stuffel's season alive in dramatic fashion, scoring three runs in the eighth inning to beat the Commodores 9-6 at War Memorial Stadium on Wednesday. The win also clinched a berth in next week's Class 5 state tournament.
