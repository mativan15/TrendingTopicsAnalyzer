'Trust' is a common word that carries uncommon weight at Walmart. While there are countless ways we strive to earn customers' trust, delivering on our promise of fast shipping and delivery has never been more important to us. Today we use our 31 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and 4,700 stores located within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population to fulfill online orders at exceptional speed. But we're not stopping there.We know we must constantly exceed our customers' expectations, which is why I'm thrilled to announce we're building four next generation fulfillment centers (FCs) over the next three years, with the first opening this summer in Joliet, Illinois.
