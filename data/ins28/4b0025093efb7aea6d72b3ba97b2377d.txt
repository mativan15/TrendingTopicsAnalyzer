Robbie Anderson's past 24 hours have been a whirlwind.
 
On Sunday, the now-former Carolina Panthers wide receiver was kicked out of a game by his own coach during a game against the Los Angeles Rams. He was then sent packing the next morning.
 
According to ESPN, 29-year-old Anderson repeatedly argued with Panthers receivers coach Joe Dailey during the first half of the game at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.
 
Anderson then spent most of the third quarter on the sidelines until he and Dailey got into a shouting match once again, per the outlet.
