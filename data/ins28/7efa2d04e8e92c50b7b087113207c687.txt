Tucker Carlson slammed Amazon for banning the sale of books by Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin and signed a  light on the government's key role in this censorship on "Tucker Carlson Tonight."TUCKER CARLSON: So you go on Amazon.com and you remember this started as a bookstore and online bookstore. It's the biggest bookstore in the world. They have everything. There's nothing you can't find an Amazon, including used books. So if you were to go into Amazon to read books by a man who is in the news and whose ideas are directly bearing on world events, you look for a guy called Aleksandr Dugin.
