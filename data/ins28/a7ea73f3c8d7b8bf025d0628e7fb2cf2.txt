Shannon Finney/Getty Images Entertainment I am bullish on the dating/social networking industry. In a previous article, I analyzed Match Group (MTCH), which is arguably the industry leader in online dating. In this article, I will analyze Match Group's biggest competitor Bumble Inc. (NASDAQ:BMBL). Although Bumble stock is down less than Match YTD, 17% vs 38%, I don't think BMBL is necessarily the better buy. In fact, I argue Bumble is fairly valued/slightly overvalued and I assign a HOLD rating. My recommendation is supported by a residual earnings valuation framework, which based on analyst EPS consensus returns a fair base-case target price for Bumble stock of $22.
