Britain's largest bank has issued an urgent warning following a spike in a new scam targetted at those struggling with the cost of living.
Lloyds Bank said it had seen a 90pc surge in so-called "advance fee" frauds in which scammers pose as a legitimate firm and demand money upfront for a loan. Victims have lost an average of £231, the bank said. 
The scam sees fraudsters contact victims who have entered their details into a seemingly professional website after searching for a loan online. 
Lloyds said scammers were posing as representatives of legitimate loan companies – even sending documents to back up their claims.
