Welcome to Metro.co.uk‘s The Big Questions, where we ask, well, the big questions (and the smaller ones too) and this week, we're diving deep with Sinitta.
Sinitta has been one of the biggest names in the entertainment industry for decades, first rising to fame in the 80s with a stellar music career that brought us the likes of hit singles So Macho and Cross My Broken Heart.
Not satisfied with simply being a music icon, in the decades following the star broke out into TV, with younger generations getting to know her through her time on the X Factor and I'm A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here!
She even helped One Direction to their own phenomenal fame – and comforted a young Harry Styles when they were booted off the singing competition.
