Wairarapa MP Kieran McAnulty doesn't think a proposal to give councils more control over where carbon forests are planted is too late to save rural communities. Farms being converted into forestry due to rising carbon costs has been an issue in many rural parts of New Zealand recently, as farming jobs and people have disappeared from small districts. Earlier this month the Government opened public consultation on how forests were managed through the National Environmental Standards for Plantation Forestry.
