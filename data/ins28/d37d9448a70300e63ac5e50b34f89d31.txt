A prosecutor described rape allegations by three women Tuesday against "That '70s Show" actor Danny Masterson from two decades ago that contained some of the same disturbing elements.Two women became woozy or passed out after a couple drinks and were tossed in his hot tub, Deputy District Attorney Reinhold Mueller said in his opening statement in Masterson's trial. One of them said he dragged her to his bed where she regained consciousness to find him having sex with her. A third woman, an ex-girlfriend, said she woke up to find him on top of her.
