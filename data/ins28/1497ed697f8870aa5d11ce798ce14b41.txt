Warner Bros. film chief Toby Emmerich will step down from his job running one Hollywood's biggest movie studios, in a major shakeup following the company's recent merger with Discovery.

The parent firm run by David Zaslav has selected longtime producers Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy to oversee the Burbank-based Warner Bros. film division, along with the smaller New Line label, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to comment.
