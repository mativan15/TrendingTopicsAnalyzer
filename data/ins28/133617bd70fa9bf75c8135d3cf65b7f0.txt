By Reuters Published: 11:44 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 11:44 EDT, 21 October 2022 MILAN, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Serie A clubs on Friday agreed to start a review of a plan to create a media unit, a move which could clear the way for external investors to take a slice of the soccer league's key business. Serie A, which relies on broadcasting rights for more than half of its revenues, lags behind the English Premier League and other major leagues in Europe in terms of income. Serie A clubs discussed plans to set up a media unit at a closed door meeting on Friday, the league's president Lorenzo Casini told reporters during a press briefing.
