Happy Friday, Crunchers! It's 27 May 2022, and we are slinking into a long weekend because it's Memorial Day weekend here in the U.S. There's no newsletter on Monday — Haje is going 🍷 wine tasting in Sonoma, and Christine is planning to spend Monday 🛋️ sitting on the sofa doing absolutely nothing, which we celebrate wholeheartedly.
