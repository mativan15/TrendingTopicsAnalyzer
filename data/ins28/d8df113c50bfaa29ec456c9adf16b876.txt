Q. In February, the display screen of my leased 2019 Mazda CX-9 cracked internally in the upper right corner. Then in April, after the car  had sat for a day, the lower left side cracked from the inside. There are no scratches or markings on the outside of the screen, and I am the only driver of the car. Do you know what's happening? A. In previous models, there was a defect in the display. Mazda issued a technical bulletin concerning the spider cracking issue. The factory warranty is 36,000 miles or three years.
