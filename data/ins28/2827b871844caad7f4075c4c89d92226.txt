Money is still flowing despite concerns about the economy, but Wall Street is wondering how much of that money is being spent on Amazon.com Inc. 'The good news is the consumer is still spending,' D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte told MarketWatch. 'The bad news is they're not spending on e-commerce.' When Amazon AMZN, +3.54% reports third-quarter earnings on Thursday afternoon, investors will find out if those concerns are valid. That anxiety is largely based on perceived waning demand for online purchases as customers save their spending for 'revenge travel' and concerts, or for grocery and gas bills amid decades-high inflation.
