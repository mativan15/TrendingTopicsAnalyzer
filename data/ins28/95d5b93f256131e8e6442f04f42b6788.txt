Boulevard Brewing Co. and Vine Street Brewing collaborated on a beer honoring Kansas City legend Buck O'Neil and will donate 100% of the proceeds to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.

The money from Buck O'Neil Barrel-Aged Saison will help preserve and honor the history of African American baseball and its effect on the social advancement of America. The late O'Neil helped establish the museum.

'I know Buck would have really liked this, especially since it's raising support for his museum,' said Bob Kendrick, Negro Leagues Baseball Museum president.
