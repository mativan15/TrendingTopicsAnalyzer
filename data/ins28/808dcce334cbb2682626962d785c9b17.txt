Liz Truss is still eligible to claim a six-figure yearly allowance from British taxpayers – despite her brief stint as prime minister.
The embattled politician resigned as the UK's most powerful leader Thursday morning after a fiscal fiasco felled her tumultuous 44-day tenure.
But even as the shortest-serving prime minister in British history, she is entitled to the Public Duty Costs Allowance, which assists former prime ministers who remain active in public life.
Worth up to £115,000 ($129,196.75) – or three times the national average income – the PCDA will allow Truss to file offset correspondence, office and public speaking costs related to her former role.
