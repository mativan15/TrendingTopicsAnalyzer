It seems like just yesterday that the Indianapolis Colts went down to Duval County, only to get blown out 24-0 and lose their eighth straight game when traveling to play the Jacksonville Jaguars.

This unusual trend stayed true in Week 2, but both teams have struggled to find a rhythm since.

The Jaguars enter this week's matchup at 2-3 on the year, losing to the Texans in a low-scoring battle during their most recent matchup. The Colts are well-rested and are hoping to get some key players back after their gritty win in Denver.
