Wall Street's main indexes opened higher on Tuesday as strong earnings from Goldman Sachs and Johnson & Johnson lifted hopes that upbeat corporate reports could soothe market worries of a potential recession due to rising inflation and interest rates. The Nasdaq Composite led the way with a gain of 2.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 600 points, or about 2%. The S&P 500 added 2.2%.

Goldman Sachs rose more than 4% after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit as rising borrowing costs boosted net interest income, cushioning the blow from a slowdown in investment banking.
