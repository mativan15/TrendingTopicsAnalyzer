Highlighting the worries about inflation, oil prices briefly rose Tuesday after the European Union agreed to block the majority of oil imports from Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine. Benchmark US crude ended up falling 0.3 per cent to settle at $US114.67 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 1 per cent to settle at $US122.84 per barrel.LoadingThe jump of more than 50 per cent for oil prices so far this year has been a big contributor to the very high inflation sweeping the world.
