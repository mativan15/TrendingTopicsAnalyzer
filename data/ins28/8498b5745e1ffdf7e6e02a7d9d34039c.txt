For the past three years, she's been unable to eat without throwing up

The mum of a student who has a rare condition that leaves her unable to eat without instantly throwing up, says seeing her daughter deteriorate is 'destroying' her - and that treatment will cost £40,000.

Helen Tuck's, 63, daughter Emma, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, became ill 'out of the blue' three years ago when she developed bilateral kidney stones.

The 22-year-old then went on to develop a kidney infection which was treated by surgery and a course of antibiotics.
