Jun. 4—WATERTOWN — Real estate developer Jake Johnson has purchased the iconic Paddock Arcade and three other downtown buildings.

He also purchased the building that houses the Barton & Loguidice engineering firm, the Key Bank building and the building next to the Paddock Arcade, 1 Public Square.

The $4.55 million deal closed Thursday. He bought the buildings from the owners of 200 Washington St. Associates, managed by Donald G.M. Coon III.

Mr. Coon said he and Mr. Johnson started talking about the deal last October while the two businessmen were attending a city meeting about the city's streetscape project.
