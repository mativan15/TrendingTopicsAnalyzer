Former England striker Darren Bent believes Jurgen Klopp will have held talks with Paul Pogba over a controversial move to Liverpool. The World Cup winner, 29, is out of contract and several top European clubs will be interested in signing him this summer. Yet the club he's leaving is Manchester United - Liverpool's arch rivals, therefore few would expect Pogba to make the daring switch to Merseyside. Despite this, Bent thinks both Klopp and Pep Guardiola - manager of United's local rivals Manchester City - would've spoken to Pogba.
