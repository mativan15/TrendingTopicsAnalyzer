Re: 'And what for those who graduated debt free?' May 22 commentary
The commentary by Dick Wadhams did not list one positive thing about the idea of reducing college debt for individuals. Paying off college loans will yet have to be debated; it is not a law.
In debating this idea, positive ideas must be on the table also. FDR signed into law the GI Bill in 1944, and about half of the 16 million World War II veterans took part in this federal program. It has been said that a dollar invested in each young GI paid our economy back sevenfold.
