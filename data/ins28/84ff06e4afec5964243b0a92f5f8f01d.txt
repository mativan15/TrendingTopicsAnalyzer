Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) anticipates to raise the price of its COVID vaccine to about four times the current price, to ~$110 to $130 per dose after the U.S. government's current purchase plan ends, Reuters reported citing a Pfizer executive Angela Lukin. Lukin — who serves as Global Primary Care & U.S. President at Pfizer, as per her Linkedin page — said she expects the COVID shot would be made available at no cost to people who have private insurance or government paid insurance, the report added. The COVID vaccine is currently given for free to all by the government.
