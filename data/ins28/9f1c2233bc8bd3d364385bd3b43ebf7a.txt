It might be of some concern to shareholders to see the Freightways Limited (NZSE:FRE) share price down 11% in the last month. But the silver lining is the stock is up over five years. However we are not very impressed because the share price is only up 29%, less than the market return of 30%. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 24% decline over the last twelve months.

Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
