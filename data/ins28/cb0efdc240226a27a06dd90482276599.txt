It's easy to drop a lot of money on a sound system for your home, especially if you want to go all in on Sonos devices. But you can save a significant amount by going the refurbished route, and now Sonos has a bunch of refurbished speakers and soundbars on sale. Key among them is the Arc soundbar — the refurbished version is $180 cheaper than a new model, bringing it down to $719. You'll also save $110 on a refurbished Sonos Five, paying $439 for one instead of $549 for a new unit. If you want to start off with something more basic, both the refurbished Sonos One and One SL are under $200.
