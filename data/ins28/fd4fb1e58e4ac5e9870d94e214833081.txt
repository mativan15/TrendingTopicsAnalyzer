Hot off the heels of the debut trailer for his feature film, Mario is back on Oct. 20 with a wild new game for Nintendo Switch, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. The game is the sequel to 2017's shockingly good strategy game Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, which saw Nintendo's mustachioed mascot team up with the Minions-esque Rabbids (themselves a spin-off of the Rayman series). Published by Ubisoft, that game took a surprising twist by merging both series into an XCOM styled strategy game that somehow stuck the landing with whimsy to spare, and would go on to become one the Switch's most-played games not published by Nintendo.
