Published: 22:46 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 00:05 EDT, 19 October 2022 Maritime workers have called for the Emerald Class fleet of Sydney ferries to be turned into "diving wrecks" after a safety investigation into the beleaguered boats found more than a dozen safety issues. A formal investigation has been launched into the fleet of three second-generation Sydney ferries, used for the Manly-city service, after two developed steering issues in as many days last month. The Office of Transport Safety Investigations said it had received 19 safety reports since the Chinese-built ferries were launched in 2019, including 10 directly relating to steering defects.
