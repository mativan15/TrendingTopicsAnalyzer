TOKYO (AP) — Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida ordered an investigation Monday into the Unification Church in an apparent move to calm the public outrage over his governing party's cozy ties with the controversial group, which were revealed in the wake of Shinzo Abe's assassination.

Former Prime Minister Abe was shot to death during an outdoor campaign speech in July. The suspect, Tetsuya Yamagami, told police he killed Abe because of his apparent link to a religious group he hated. A letter and social media postings attributed to Yamagami said his mother's large donations to the church bankrupted his family and ruined his life.
