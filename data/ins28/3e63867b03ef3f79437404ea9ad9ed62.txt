It achieved this by going public on Nasdaq via a Special Purpose Acquisition Vehicle (SPAC) with Queen's Gambit Growth Capital, a women-led blank-check company, as its sponsor.Two months later, the bus-hailing company which started in Egypt is laying off 400 people—about 32% of its workforce—in a bid to become cash flow profitable by 2023.The turn of events is not unusual for the current global tech climate.
