Pakistan pacer Shaheen Afridi, who has been off cricket with knee injury for a while, seems to have come back in ominous form. In the warm-up match against Afghanistan on Wednesday, the leftarm pacer bowled with the new ball and in the very first over sent a vicious yorker that crashed into opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz's foot.

Gurbaz was declared leg before wicket, but that was the least of Afghanistan's worry. The batter seemed to be in terrible pain and had to hobble off the field with help from a teammate.
