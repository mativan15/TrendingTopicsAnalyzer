Wouldn't you know it, there's extra football to end the Week Six slate.

The Chargers and Broncos are headed to overtime tied at 16.

Los Angeles had a chance to go on a game-winning drive at the end of regulation. But the Chargers drive stalled at their own 44-yard line.

Quarterback Justin Herbert attempted a Hail Mary with one second left on fourth down, but the pass was short of the end zone and fell incomplete.
