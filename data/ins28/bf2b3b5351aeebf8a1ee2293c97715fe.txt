Ezra Miller has pleaded not guilty to felony burglary charges, it has been claimed.
The Flash star – who is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns – was charged with felony burglary after an incident in Stamford, Vermont, earlier this year.
Police received notification of a burglary complain from a property in the area on May 1, and found that several bottles of alcohol had been taken from the residence while the owners were not home.
After collecting statements and assessing CCTV footage, officers are said to have found ‘probable cause' to charge the 30-year-old with ‘felony burglary into an unoccupied dwelling'.
