A Southern Baptist Convention sexual abuse task force bypassed calls for victim compensation on Wednesday as it suggested reforms for church delegates to approve at this month's business session in Anaheim, California. Instead, the panel recommended establishing an 'implementation task force' that would review and implement suggestions from an independent report on abuse within the 14 million-member denomination that was released May 22. They also want delegates to vote on creating a 'Ministry Check' website that would maintain a record of pastors and other employees and volunteers who have 'been credibly accused' of abuse.
