Published: 09:44 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 09:45 EDT, 17 October 2022 "Liberation Day," by George Saunders (Random House) George Saunders is back with a new collection of short stories that feature his usual dystopian worlds and heartland characters whose lives and language have been fractured by social and economic pressures they barely understand. In the title story, "Liberation Day," the protagonists are rich enough to afford an "entertainment center" where less fortunate humans whose memories have been wiped clean are pinioned to a wall to reenact historical dramas like the Battle of the Little Bighorn for the amusement of the owners´ wealthy friends.
