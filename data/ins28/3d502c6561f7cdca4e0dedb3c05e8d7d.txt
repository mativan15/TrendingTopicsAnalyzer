A lawsuit between restaurant owners in a Wake County town has reached its end. But whether the business will reopen is unknown.

The co-owners of Wendell restaurant Farmers & Merchants have come to an agreement following months of legal battle. The dispute arose after Christopher Critzer, the plaintiff in the case, purchased a 50 percent stake in a hospitality group led by Sigurd Westerlund, the defendant.

The two parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal on Sept. 29.

The restaurant, located on Main Street in downtown Wendell, has been closed since early this year.
