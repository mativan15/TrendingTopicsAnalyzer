He had just identified the body of his 22-year-old son, Allasem, one of 50 people killed in the violence that erupted as people protested against Chad's government on Thursday. Hundreds took to the streets of the capital N'Djamena to demand a quicker transition to democratic rule just weeks after a military junta announced it was extending its time in power by two years.
