The Brazilian striker is currently on international duty, but Manchester City bosses plan to speak to his representatives over the next few days.

Arsenal have never hidden their interest in Jesus, 25, and have already held one round of talks with his agent Marcelo Pettinati.
And even though the Gunners missed out on Champions League football on the final day, the City forward is still interested in a potential move to the Emirates.
