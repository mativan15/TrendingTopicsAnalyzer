October 20, 2022 09:05 AM Eastern Daylight Time NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Torii, creator of the #1 Automated SaaS Management Platform (SMP), today released 'The State of SaaS At Work Report: Collaboration in a Distributed Workplace.' It reveals that most (60%) IT pros are in the dark when it comes to understanding their cloud app ecosystem, and only a small fraction collaborates with other key teams on controlling costs, securing data, and responding to changing business conditions. It also finds tremendous dissonance between how well IT thinks they're working with other teams to manage distributed SaaS, and how poorly they actually are.
