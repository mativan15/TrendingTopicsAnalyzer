Setting aside their ideological differences and political battles, Sharad Pawar and Devendra Fadnavis have made cricket a common cause ahead of the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) elections scheduled to be held on Thursday. But the move has sparked speculation in some sections, given that it comes in the wake of the consensus among all parties to let the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena's candidate Rutuja Latke win the Andheri (East) bypoll unopposed.
On Wednesday, the Garware Club House at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium hosted an important dinner for the who's who of Maharashtra politics as, for the first time, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis sat at the same dining table.
