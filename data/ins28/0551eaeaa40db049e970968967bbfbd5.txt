The organisers of Pride in London said there is huge 'energy and excitement' building ahead of its historic 50th anniversary parade as Pride month kicks off in the capital.

Around 1.5 million people are expected to descend on the capital's streets on July 2 for the parade which returns after a two year hiatus following the Covid pandemic.

The march's route will begin at Hyde Park Corner, tracing part of the historic route from the original 1972 march.

It will come after Pride month which begins June 1 and features events celebrating the capital's LGBT+ community.
