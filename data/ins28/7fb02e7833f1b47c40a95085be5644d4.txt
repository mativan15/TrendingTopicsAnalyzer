La La Land Kind Café is a coffee shop that has locations in and around Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California.
It proudly makes delicious handcrafted beverages — but the café has a much bigger purpose for its business as well. 
The café has a very simple motto: Normalize kindness.
'We believe that success is measured [by] the positive impact we make in society, not just how much money we make,' according to the café's website. 
So how exactly is the company doing that? 
It's spreading kindness to its customers in its shops and throughout the community.
