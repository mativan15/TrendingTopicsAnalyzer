With a secret sauce conjured in the bowels of Meta, and a mission to provide "the safest and most scalable layer 1 blockchain," Aptos launched its mainnet today, the culmination of four years of technical development and a $1 billion valuation. Leading exchange FTX, an Aptos investor, has already announced that it will list Aptos' APT token on Wednesday.

Dubbed a potential "Solana killer" by many, Aptos is the latest high-profile attempt to build the perfect blockchain for smart contracts, code that supports the sprawling world of NFTs, DAOs, and DeFi.
