The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), under the commerce ministry, has directed its regional authorities to physically verify all documents of applicants for export of wheat before issuing Registration Certificates (RCs). The order has been issued to ensure that the exporters are not issued RCs based on improper documents, it said.
