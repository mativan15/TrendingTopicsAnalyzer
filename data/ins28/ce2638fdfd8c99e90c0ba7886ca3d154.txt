June 01, 2022 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Reltio, a leading cloud-native, data management SaaS company that accelerates the value of data for businesses, has crossed the $100 million mark in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), a significant milestone driven by growing interest from enterprises across industries to adopt modern, cloud MDM solutions as part of their digital transformation strategies.

As of Q1 2022, there were over 1,000 unicorn companies globally; however, only about 150 of them have achieved $100 million ARR or 'centaur' status, making them seven times rarer than a unicorn.
