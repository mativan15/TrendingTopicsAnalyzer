The Middlesex Sheriff's Office is warning residents to be aware of an ongoing scam targeting medical professionals. This warning comes after three separate incident reports were made by individuals in the medical field saying they received calls telling them they had failed to appear as expert witnesses in court matters.

The scammer, or scammers, utilized a fake name and identified themselves as a member of the Middlesex Sheriff's Office, according to officials.

In one instance, a scammer told one professional that they may have to pay $10,000 in fines and fees.
