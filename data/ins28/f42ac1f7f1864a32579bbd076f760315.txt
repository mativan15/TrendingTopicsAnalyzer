Remember an elderly person chiding you with the words ‘Padhoge likhoge banoge nawab, kheloge kudoge banoge kharab (Education, and not sports, will provide you with the means of living)'? These words must have been directed at you when you were not found studying. However, this notion is losing applicability in today's scenario.
Sports are being widely opted as a serious career choice as a result of what athletes have achieved from recent national and international sporting events. Besides keeping your mind sharp and your body physically fit, sports can also bring good money and recognition if you are passionate enough about it.
