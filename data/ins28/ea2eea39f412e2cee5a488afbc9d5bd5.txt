Some radical changes have been proposed in the new system of recruitment in the three services — Army, Navy and the Air Force — under the Tour of Duty/Agneepath scheme wherein 100 per cent of the soldiers recruited shall be released from service after four years and then 25 per cent re-enlisted for full service.
Highly placed sources have informed that there has been much discussion over the final format of the Tour of Duty and that some new suggestions have been proposed and are likely to be accepted as the announcement of the new recruitment scheme is expected any day now.
