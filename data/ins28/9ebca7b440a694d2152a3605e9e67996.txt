A photographic exhibit unveiled Saturday night aims to evoke a sense of belonging and to deepen the connection among the Latin American community in the province. 'Rastros' Latinidad Through Images features portraits of nine Latinx people making an impact in their community. The event was created by Ay, Caramba!, a Latinx theatre in Saskatchewan. Those featured include chefs, actors, musicians and more. Yulissa Campos is the project manager behind the exhibit and says Latinx people in the province can often feel invisible.
