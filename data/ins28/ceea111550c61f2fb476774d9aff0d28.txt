MOUNT JULIET, Tennessee (WSMV) -- A Wilson County school board member says LGBTQ flags and stickers along with other symbols that represent a group or belief should be taken out of classrooms.

And newly elected school board member, Joseph Padilla, said he is looking to create school policy around that matter.

Padilla said the genesis of the move was concerns brought to him by parents who say those LGBTQ flags or stickers shouldn't be in the classrooms.

'This isn't Joe's opinion, this is Wilson County's opinion,' Padilla said.
