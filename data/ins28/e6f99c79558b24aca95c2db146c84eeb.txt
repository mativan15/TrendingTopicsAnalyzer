EAST LANSING − Michigan State University trustees said in a statement Monday they hope to quickly select an interim president to lead the university while a search for a permanent replacement for President Samuel Stanley Jr. is conducted.

Stanley on Thursday announced his resignation as president from the university. He said he had lost confidence in the Board of Trustees, including some who have been pushing for his removal over reported Title IX concerns, including the resignation of former Broad College of Business Dean Sanjay Gupta.
