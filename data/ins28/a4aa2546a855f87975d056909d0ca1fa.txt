LIVERPOOL, England (AP) — Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said Liverpool fans needed to improve their aim after coins were allegedly thrown at him — and missed — during his team's 1-0 defeat at Anfield on Sunday.

Liverpool, meanwhile, said City fans must behave better.

'We are deeply disappointed to hear vile chants relating to football stadium tragedies from the away section during today's game at Anfield,' Liverpool said in a statement after the Premier League game.
