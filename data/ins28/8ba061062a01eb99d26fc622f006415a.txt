The first time drag superstar Trixie Mattel came to Palm Springs, she felt as though she found her way home, especially when she spotted breeze blocks in her signature color: pink.

Mattel, the drag persona created by Brian Michael Firkus, evokes '60s glamour and midcentury vibes — two themes the desert city is known for. Hailing from rural Wisconsin, Firkus was far away from Palm Springs when he designed the character. On that first trip, though, Mattel — who compares her drag persona to one of the housewives from the film "Edward Scissorhands" — found herself in a spot that was "frozen in time," much like her look.
