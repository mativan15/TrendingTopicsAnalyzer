The king is dead. You already know that if you've seen the teaser for episode 9, titled The Green Council, which announced the monarch's passing after last week's show. Just before Viserys died, he managed to ensure the realm's disruption when he accidentally gave Alicent the impression he wanted their son Aegon to be king.A classic mix up! This wouldn't have happened if the Targaryens didn't insist of naming every second newborn Aegon. The Green Council is the penultimate episode of House of the Dragon's first season.
