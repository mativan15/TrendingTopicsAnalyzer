Currently no family physicians in Saskatoon are accepting new patients.
At a press conference Wednesday morning, NDP Leader Carla Beck says the situation along with the entire health care system is in crisis and needs to be treated as such.'It is extraordinary, though, that in Saskatoon, you know, our largest city in the province, there's not a single family physician accepting new patients.'NDP health critic Vicki Mowat says the government is sitting on $2 billion windfall revenues.'Not a drop of this has been invested into our health care system,' said Mowat.
