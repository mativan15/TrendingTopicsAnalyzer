It's no secret that delaying the start of Social Security benefits typically means you'll get more money in retirement. And waiting just got even more worthwhile thanks to the program's big cost-of-living adjustment set for next year.Here's why: Even if you don't collect benefits, the COLA adjustment — 8.7% for 2023 — still gets factored into the amount you're eligible to receive starting at age 62. And it gets compounded, so each year you hold off on collecting to full retirement age (somewhere between 66 and 67 depending on when you were born) or beyond will make your eventual payout even juicier.
