Julia Fox has set her sights on a trip to space if she manages to track down Elon Musk's phone number. 
The actress, 32, revealed that the phone number she most wants in the world is that of Elon, adding: ‘I have a lot of ideas.'
When asked what they entailed, Julia stayed coy, explaining: ‘Well, I can't give them away… But a lot of ideas in terms of sustainability and, you know, tech things. 
‘Techy things that could be good for the world. And also sustainable avenues in terms of fashion and living and stuff like that – chic, making it chic,' she told The Face.
