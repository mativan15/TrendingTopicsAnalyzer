Liz Truss has said she is 'completely committed' to a triple lock on pensions, backtracking on what No 10 had said on Tuesday.
Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said the government's latest U-turn had left pensioners on the frontline for cuts, but Truss said she and the chancellor are 'completely committed' to the triple lock.
On Tuesday, the PM's spokesperson clearly signalled that the triple lock – the guarantee that the state pension will rise every year in line with inflation, earnings, or 2.
