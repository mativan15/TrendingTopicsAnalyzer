Charles Wollertz Just over three months ago, I wrote on Hochschild Mining (OTCQX:HCHDF), noting that if the stock slid below US$1.25 near key support, it would present a buying opportunity, but the best trading strategy was to sell at a 17-20% profit. While the stock gave exactly after rallying off this level following its May pullback, it has since been decimated, being cut in half and dropping below US$0.70 per share. This has left Hochschild trading at its cheapest valuation in years, and it is one of the only precious metals stocks sitting at or near its 2016 lows at a time when gold traded near $1,200/oz.
