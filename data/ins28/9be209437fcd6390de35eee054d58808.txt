There is a change atop the Chicago Fire but not the one most would expect after the team finished 10-15-9 and missed the playoffs for a fifth straight season.

The Fire on Tuesday announced they picked up the contract options of sporting director Georg Heitz and technical director Sebastian Pelzer, who will return in 2023 for their fourth seasons with the club.

Meanwhile, team President Ishwara Glassman Chrein will leave the Fire for what the club said was a desire to be closer to her family in New York.
