Michael Vi Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is one of the most controversial companies in America. Either you love it, hate it, or have no idea what the company does. I love Palantir, and I'll tell you why. Palantir is a unique, dominant, market-leading company with excellent growth prospects and remarkable long-term profitability potential. Additionally, many investors may view Palantir as a government contractor, but the company's immense growth and profitability potential are in the private sector. Moreover, Palantir's technical image looks increasingly bullish, and sentiment should improve soon.
