Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently disclosed that her husband exercised Alphabet stock call options in September.

The options were exercised just over a week before House leadership unveiled a bill that would ban members and their spouses from trading individual stocks.

Pelosi's husband also sold call options in NVIDIA and Micron Technology for a loss over a month after Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 into law.
