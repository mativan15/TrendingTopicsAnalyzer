Former "The Dukes of Hazzard" star John Schneider ripped Hollywood for going woke and caring only about the "bottom line" as he said he has been forced to produce his new film without any major studio backing. "All the celebrities, God bless their cute little souls, they owe their soul to the company store," Schneider said on "Varney & Co." Friday. "They're afraid to have independent thought, they're afraid to say something that's outside of the consumer norm."Schneider's newly released film, "To Die For," was directed and produced independently without major studio backing.
