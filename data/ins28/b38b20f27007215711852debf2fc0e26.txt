Memorabilia from the Queen's coronation in 1953 lives on in many houses in Britain. I can clearly remember visiting my own great-grandmother and spending the entire car journey down trying to decide whether to drink my hot chocolate out of a coronation mug or a Charles and Diana one. Which means it is probably worth buying something nice ahead of the Queen's platinum jubilee celebrations this June, as a small person may well be transfixed by them in years to come. 
It's important to buy the right souvenirs, though.
