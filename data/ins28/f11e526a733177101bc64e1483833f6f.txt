The May 21 storm has pushed more residents and businesses to purchase standby and portable generators in the Ottawa area, and one local business has reported a major surge in interest due to the potential for more similar storms.At the offices of D.R. Howell Electric in Kemptville, Ont., they've so far received more than 1,000 inquiries for standby generators — fixed devices, in this case powered by natural gas, which are directly connected to a home's electrical system and automatically turn on when there's a hydro failure.
