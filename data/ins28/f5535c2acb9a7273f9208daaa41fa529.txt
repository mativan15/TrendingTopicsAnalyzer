Stocks rose Tuesday for the second-consecutive day after a flurry of better-than-expected earnings reports.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 341.67 points, or 1.13%, to 30,527.49. The S&P 500 rose 42.55 points, or 1.16%, to 3,720.50, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 96.60 points, or 0.90%, to 10,772.40.
All three indexes traded higher in early trading but gave back most of the day's gains after Treasury bond yields rose. The hot start to the week helped reverse sustained market declines amid investor uncertainty over inflation and the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat it with interest rate hikes.
