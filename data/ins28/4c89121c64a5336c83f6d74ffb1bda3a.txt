Even a prison sentence isn't going to get in the way of a former athlete's discipline.
Former world No. 1 tennis player Boris Becker is reportedly thriving behind bars as he helps his fellow inmates keep fit by hosting makeshift exercise sessions at UK's Huntercombe prison, according to the German newspaper Bild.
The 54-year-old German tennis star is currently serving a 2 1/2-year sentence after being jailed in September.
He was convicted of four charges under the British Insolvency Act after he broke the parameters of his bankruptcy by moving hundreds of thousands of British pounds from his business account, along with hiding property in his hometown of Leimen, Germany.
