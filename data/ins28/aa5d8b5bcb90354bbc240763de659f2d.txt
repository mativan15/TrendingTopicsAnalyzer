Oct. 16—Tourism is on the upswing in Morgan County, officials say, with fiscal 2022 revenue from hotel stays not just surpassing the depressed fiscal 2020 pandemic revenue but also rocketing past pre-pandemic and fiscal 2021 revenue.

"Tourism is back in full swing," said Decatur Morgan County Tourism Director Danielle Gibson.

The city's lodging tax revenues reflect the improvement. While final fiscal 2022 numbers have not been tallied, city Chief Financial Officer Kyle Demeester said lodging revenues are on track to be 20% higher than in fiscal 2021.
