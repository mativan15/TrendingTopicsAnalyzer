The Good Brigade Introduction Opendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN) is fundamentally a real estate acquisition company that flips residential real estate using a proprietary algorithmic model. As a real estate investor with experience in the private residential and commercial markets, Opendoor caught my eye as it now appears to be trading at a discount to its underlying net asset value ("NAV") or its theoretical liquidation value. In the public markets, my preferred investment style is to purchase shares of cash-flow positive companies at substantial discounts to liquidation value.
