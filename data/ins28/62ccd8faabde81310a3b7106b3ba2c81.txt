AgenciesThe bench said it is staying the conditions imposed by the High Court and would hear the matter after the vacation.The Supreme Court Friday stayed the Allahabad High Court's bail condition imposed on Samajwadi Party MLA Azam Khan directing the District Magistrate of Rampur for taking possession of land attached to the Jauhar University campus in an alleged grabbing of enemy property case. A vacation bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Bela M Trivedi said that prima facie the Allahabad High Court's bail condition imposed on Khan is disproportionate and sounds like a decree of a civil court.
