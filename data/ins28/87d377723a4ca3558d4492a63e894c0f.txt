Australia launched an investigation Wednesday into what the defence minister called disturbing reports that China has been hiring retired Western air force pilots to train its military. The UK government had earlier announced it would take "decisive steps" to stop Beijing from headhunting former pilots after British media reported that over 30 former pilots had accepted offers upwards of £240,000 ($273,750) to train China's air force. "We are taking decisive steps to stop Chinese recruitment schemes attempting to headhunt serving and former UK Armed Forces pilots to train People's Liberation Army personnel," a spokesperson for the British defence ministry told AFP.
