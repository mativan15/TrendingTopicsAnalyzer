BOSTON (AP) — Derek Forbort scored the tiebreaking goal with 9:29 left in the third period, and the Boston Bruins won their home opener 6-3 over Arizona on Saturday night, beating the Coyotes for the 19th straight time.

It's the Bruins' longest winning streak in club history against any opponent, with their last loss against the Coyotes coming on Oct. 9, 2010, in Prague.

The Bruins have won their first two games to begin their 99th season under new coach Jim Montgomery, who replaced the fired Bruce Cassidy.
