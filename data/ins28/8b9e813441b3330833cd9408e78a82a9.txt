Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) holds a double-digit lead over his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke with less than three weeks left until Election Day, according to a new poll.

The incumbent is leading O'Rourke by 11 points among likely voters, 54 percent to 43 percent, the poll from the University of Texas' Texas Politics Project found.

Nearly all Republicans and Democrats said they plan to vote for their party's respective candidate. However, Abbott has a strong advantage among Independents, with 60 percent saying they would support him and 29 percent saying they would support the former congressman and presidential candidate.
