TikTok has been accused of preparing to keep covert tabs on the physical whereabouts of certain US citizens using its app.
The viral video giant, ultimately owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, has long been a concern for privacy watchdogs in America and elsewhere over concerns it could be used to spy on the West. Now, it's claimed steps were underway to track selected targets' every move.
According to Forbes this week, ByteDance has an Internal Audit and Risk Control department that typically uses location data from the app to monitor and investigate current and former employees suspected of wrongdoing.
