Tesla CEO Elon Musk has a 'super bad feeling' about the economy and wants to cut about 10% of jobs at the electric carmaker, he said in an email to executives on Thursday seen by Reuters.
 

 The message came two days after the world's richest man told employees to return to the workplace or leave the company.
 

 Tesla
 
 (TSLA) employed around 100,000 people in the company and its subsidiaries at the end of 2021, according to its annual SEC filing.
