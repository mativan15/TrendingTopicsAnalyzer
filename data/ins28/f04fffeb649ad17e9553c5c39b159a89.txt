Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles of Spring is asking her supporters not to dress as Jeffrey Dahmer for Halloween. Biles is not happy serial killer-related costumes have popped up all over the internet ahead of Halloween. eBay recently announced they are banning the sale of costumes that look like Dahmer and are taking down current listings one at a time. The Netflix drama Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story has become one of the streaming platform's most successful series of all time. Scripted shows about the criminally bizarre like Ted Bundy have also grabbed viewers' attention.
