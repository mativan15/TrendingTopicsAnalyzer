A race for one of California's congressional seats has produced some bizarre subplots, giving it a faintly Shakespearian feel.One candidate is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to prop up an opponent. Another candidate bucked his party's stance on Israel and made some anti-Semitic remarks in the process. And, to top it all off, the national GOP is mainlining money into the race to ensure a Republican incumbent makes it through next month's primary.   This is all happening in California's newly drawn 40th congressional district, which includes portions of Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and the cities and communities of Yorba Linda, Chino Hills, Anaheim, Rancho Santa Margarita, Mission Viejo, Aliso Viejo and Tustin.
