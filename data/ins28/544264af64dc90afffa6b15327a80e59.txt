The electorate is fed up, dejected and feel absolutely taken for granted. This isn't even party political now. The so-called mandate no longer holds. No one voted for this disarray, for higher rents, bigger bills, rocketing interest rates.
Each man kills the thing he loves and any true Tory would actually see that. Brexit may have made the country ungovernable, and it is certainly pushing the union apart. Scotland quite understandably is relieved not to be part of this omnishambles.
It is not good enough to say Truss inherited one of the worst in-trays of all time.
