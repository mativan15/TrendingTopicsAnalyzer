Cuts to London's transport budget will see 22 bus routes axed under proposals published today.
Transport for London (TfL) has unveiled plans to slim down the capital's bus network after the ‘devastating' impact of the Covid-19 on its finances.
City Hall has put the blame firmly at the government's door, saying it had to commit to finding ‘significant financial savings' in order to secure a bailout to get it through the pandemic. 
TfL said 78 routes out of more than 620 would be impacted by the proposed changes, including the ones set to be cut altogether.
