AlexSecret/iStock via Getty Images With a lot of software companies having had their valuations re-rated recently, we are looking for the ones that might have become a bargain. A company that has become a lot more attractive is Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC). Shares are trading at less than half of their peak, and the company is doing relatively well operationally. It just reported another strong quarter. While its growth rate has come down, we believe its current rate of growth is a lot more sustainable, and we find the valuation a lot more reasonable, even when taking into account this lower growth rate, and that shares are gaining after the report of the most recent quarter.
