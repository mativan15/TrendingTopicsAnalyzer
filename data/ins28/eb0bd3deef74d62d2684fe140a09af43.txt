Former CNN anchor and reporter Brooke Baldwin is expressing concern at what she described as a trend of television news companies to quickly decamp from coverage of mass shootings days after the tragedies take place. 
Leading executives at major cable newsrooms, Baldwin suggests in a piece published in The Atlantic on Tuesday, are driven by ratings and revenue figures rather than news value and empathy for victims when they decide how long and to what extent mass shootings and their aftermath should be covered.
