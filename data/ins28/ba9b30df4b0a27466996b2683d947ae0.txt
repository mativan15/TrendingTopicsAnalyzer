Britain's inflation rate increased to 10.1 per cent last month, largely on the back of a 14 per cent annual increase in the price of food. (Hollie Adams/Bloomberg)British food prices rose at the fastest pace since 1980 last month, driving inflation back to a 40-year high and heaping pressure on the embattled government to balance the books without gutting help for the nation's poorest residents.The Office for National Statistics said Wednesday that food prices jumped 14.6 per cent in the year through September, led by the soaring cost of staples like meat, bread, milk and eggs.
