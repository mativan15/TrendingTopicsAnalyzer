US President Joe Biden challenged the one-China principle in a news conference, then said that the US' policy to Taiwan has not changed. Whatever they claim, that won't alter the fact that Taiwan is part of China. Besides such remarks, the US has also strengthened the QUAD alliance, obviously against China. Its purpose is clear: To build an Asian version of NATO. But China is not afraid of NATO, let alone its copy. Japan claims to be a US ally, but is actually more like its puppet. The key to preventing Taiwan 'independence' lies in Taiwan politics.
