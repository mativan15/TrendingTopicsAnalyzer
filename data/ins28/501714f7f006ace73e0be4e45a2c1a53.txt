The Toronto Blue Jays and manager John Schneider have agreed to terms on a three-year contract with a team option for the 2026 season, the club announced Friday. Schneider guided the Blue Jays to a 46-28 record after being promoted to interim skipper on July 13 following the departure of manager Charlie Montoyo. The Blue Jays reached the playoffs but were swept in the wild-card series by the Seattle Mariners. Schneider, a 42-year-old native of Princeton, N.J., is the 14th manager in franchise history.
