Hargreaves Lansdown's chief executive will quit after six years leading the UK's largest investment platform, as the company attempts to convince investors it can deliver on ambitious plans for tech-fuelled growth.Chris Hill, who has steered the FTSE 100 group since 2017, on Monday said he would step down by November next year, giving the board time to find a replacement.The move comes after Hill in February outlined a five-year strategy to invest £175mn in upgrading the investment platform's system and building a tech-led financial advice service, funded in part by cutting dividends.
