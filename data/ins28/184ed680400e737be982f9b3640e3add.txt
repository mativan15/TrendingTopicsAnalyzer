Truist Financial Corp. (NYSE: TFC) saw mixed results for its third-quarter earnings as a result of a shifting market environment — similar to other big banks.

Charlotte-based Truist on Tuesday posted net income available to shareholders at $1.5 billion, or $1.15 per diluted share, for the third quarter. That's a decrease from $1.6 billion, or $1.20 per share, in the same quarter last year.

Revenue in the third quarter hit $5.9 billion, up from $5.6 billion in last year's quarter. The bank said the increase in revenue from a year ago was due to higher market interest rates coupled with deposit costs and loan growth.
