National Express has reported a further rebound in passengers, and a rise in revenues after it stepped up services during rail strikes and helped shuttle police during the Queen's funeral.The coach and bus operator said revenue rose by 33% in the three months to the end of September, and were now above 2019 levels, thanks in part to strong growth in its UK and Spanish coach business.In the UK, it said demand was partly driven by industrial action on the country's train network. That included August strikes by rail operators which halted intercity trains across Britain.
