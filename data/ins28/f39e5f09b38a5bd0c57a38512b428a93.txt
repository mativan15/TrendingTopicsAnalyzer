Tether has launched its USDT token on Polygon, an Ethereum scaling platform, meaning the largest stablecoin by market capitalization is now available on more than 11 blockchains, the company said.

The addition of USDT, which is tied 1:1 to the dollar and has a market cap of over $73 billion, will help support Polygon's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem by providing a stable currency for investors to generate yield and move in and out of the network.
