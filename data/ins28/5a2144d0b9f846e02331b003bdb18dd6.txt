AgenciesNo Mining and Factories within 1 km of National Parks, says SCThe Supreme Court on Friday banned mining and developmental activities inside national parks and wildlife sanctuaries and within a 1-km buffer zone around them. A bench comprising Justice L Nageswara Rao, Justice BR Gavai and Justice Aniruddha Bose also said that no permanent structures or prohibited activities will be allowed within the 1-km eco-sensitive zone around such parks and sanctuaries.

For activities already undertaken within the 1-km buffer zone or extended buffer zone of any wildlife sanctuary or national park, and which don't come within the ambit of prohibited activities as per the guidelines issued on February 9, 2011, the bench said such activities may continue with the permission of the principal chief conservator of forests of the state or Union Territory concerned.
