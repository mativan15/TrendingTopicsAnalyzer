The Supreme Court on Tuesday voted to strike down a Texas law that would prevent social media platforms from moderating or deleting content concerning users' viewpoints.

HB 20 echoes right-wing accusations that platforms such as Twitter and Facebook deliberately target conservative speech with content moderation policies such as 'shadow banning,' which the platforms have repeatedly denied.

Tuesday's decision marks a temporary victory for the tech industry by reinstating a junction that blocks HB20 from going into effect while federal courts further debate its merit.
