The energy price cap is the maximum amount a utility company can charge an average customer in the UK per year for the amount of electricity and gas they use, preventing businesses from simply passing on cost increases to the consumer.But the cap, set by the regulator Ofgem and first introduced in January 2019, only applies to customers who are on a standard variable tariff, typically a provider's default and most expensive option.It does not safeguard consumers against global market fluctuations and does not limit an individual's overall bill – if you use more than the 'average user', you still pay more.
