Talks between a train drivers' union and ScotRail are due to resume on Monday in a dispute over pay which has seen more than 700 rail services cut.Aslef last week rejected a 4.2% pay deal and warned that if an agreement cannot be reached, the union could ballot for industrial action.The newly nationalised ScotRail introduced a temporary timetable in late May, cutting a third of services, due to the impact of drivers declining to work overtime or rest days as part of the dispute.Kevin Lindsay, the union's Scottish organiser, has said that he believes a deal is 'close' and that the ball is in ScotRail's court.
