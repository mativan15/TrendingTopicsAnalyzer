LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Liz Truss battled to retain her grip on power on Thursday, a day after she lost a second top minister and open arguments and jostling among her lawmakers in parliament highlighted a breakdown of party unity and discipline.

In just six weeks as prime minister, Truss has been forced to abandon almost all her policy programme after it triggered a bond market rout and a collapse of her approval ratings and those of her Conservative Party.
