Homeless people who have asked for help from their local council are 'trapped' on the streets, sofa surfing and in B&Bs due to a 'crippling' shortage of affordable homes, a charity has warned.Almost half (46%) of those who sought help from their local authority remained homeless after their contact with the housing team ended, according to a survey by Crisis.Without enough housing stock, councils are increasingly having to rely on expensive temporary accommodation or push people towards the private rented sector, it said.
