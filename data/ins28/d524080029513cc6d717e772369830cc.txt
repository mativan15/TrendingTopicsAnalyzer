JMrocek/iStock via Getty Images Introduction It's been a year since I've covered U.S. telecommunications company iQSTEL (OTCQB:IQST) on SA and I think this is a good time to give an update on my thoughts on it. The firm booked a 37% increase in revenues in Q1 2022 and its working capital is now positive. However, iQSTEL is still unprofitable and it hasn't managed to uplist to NASDAQ, which somewhat limits its exposure to investors. Overall, I think the fundamentals of the business have improved over the past year but iQSTEL still seems significantly overvalued.
