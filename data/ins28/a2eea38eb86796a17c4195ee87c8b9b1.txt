Disney villains are an institution for the Mouse House. Far more interesting than the studio's heroes and often the most memorable part of its films, villains are as important to Disney's success as the princesses that built the company. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the studio's first film, but the Evil Queen is far more enduring than the weak and nearly inconsequential girl at the center of the story. The Little Mermaid, the film that launched the Disney Renaissance and established the modern slate of princesses, features a precocious redhead as the protagonist, but it's the villain, the larger-than-life octopus/woman Ursula, that secured the film a place in the pantheon of animated classics.
