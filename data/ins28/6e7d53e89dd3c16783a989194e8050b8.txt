Credit is at its most expensive in more than a decade, finance chiefs have said as they forecast that revenues will fall over the next year.The cost of borrowing money has reached its highest level since 2010, according to a survey of 87 chief financial officers (CFOs) by Deloitte, the management consultancy.Forecasts have become significantly more pessimistic about the cost of finance since the government's mini-budget at the end of last month.Seventy-seven per cent of finance chiefs rated the level of economic and financial uncertainty as high or very high, up from 61 per cent in the previous quarter and its highest level since the start of the pandemic.
