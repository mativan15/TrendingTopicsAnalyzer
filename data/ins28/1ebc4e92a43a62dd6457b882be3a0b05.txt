Winnipeg's civic election is just over a week away, and many of the candidates seeking the city's top job have ranked roads, infrastructure and active transportation among their key priorities if elected mayor.
Rick Shone told 680 CJOB's The Start that he would re-prioritize capital road projects, with a focus on existing roads that are in dire need of repair.He gave the example Kenaston Boulevard as a heavily-used road in need of some serious TLC.'It does go into some pretty heavy residential, commercial areas.
