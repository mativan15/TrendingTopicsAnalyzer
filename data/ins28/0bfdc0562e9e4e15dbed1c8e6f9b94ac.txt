Elon Musk criticize Jackson Palmer, a dogecoin cocreator, on Twitter after he called the richest man in the world a "grifter." In an interview with the Australian news site Crikey, Palmer said he messaged Musk on Twitter several years ago after creating a bot that could help identify crypto scams on Twitter. During the exchange, he said it became clear that Musk "didn't understand coding as well as he made out." Palmer said Musk didn't know how to run the Python script. "He sells a vision in hopes that he can one day deliver what he's promising, but he doesn't know that," Palmer said.
