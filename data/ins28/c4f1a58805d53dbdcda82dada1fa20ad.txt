Behind the Review host and Yelp's Small Business Expert, Emily Washcovick, shares a look at this week's episode of the podcast.

Sometimes you just want to go where everybody knows your name. If you're in San Angelo, Texas, that place is SoCo Taphouse, a craft beer bar that both owner Brandon Gardner and Yelp Elite reviewer Josh H. call "The Cheers of Beers."

SoCo has earned the familiar designation, thanks in large part to the incredibly knowledgeable staff. "The feeling you get when you're at SoCo, it does come down to the staff because they help sustain and maintain the vibe that I think Brandon was going for when he started," Josh said.
