Tech billionaire Elon Musk, the world's richest person, says he's "obviously overpaying" to buy Twitter, just a week before a judge's deadline for his $44 billion takeover of the company.Musk's purchase of Twitter has been fraught with controversies, including lawsuits and a potential upcoming trial.Musk is buying the social media site for $54.20 a share, an offer he first made in April, though he came close to scoring an 8% discount, sources previously told Insider."Although obviously myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for Twitter right now, the long-term potential for Twitter in my view is an order of magnitude greater its current value," Musk, who is Tesla's CEO, said at the electric-vehicle maker's earnings call Wednesday, per a transcript of the call from Insider's Tim Levin.
