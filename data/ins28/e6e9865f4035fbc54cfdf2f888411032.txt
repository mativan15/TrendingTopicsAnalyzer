Jun. 2—High fuel prices have not yet impacted operations of area law enforcement agencies. But officials from the Daviess County Sheriff's Department and Kentucky State Police said they have made, or could implement, changes to reduce fuel usage if gasoline prices stay high.

The average gasoline price in Kentucky on Wednesday was $4.42, according to AAA, although the price of regular gasoline was more than $4.53 per gallon at some city convenience stores that afternoon.

One year ago, the average price of regular gas in the state was $2.
