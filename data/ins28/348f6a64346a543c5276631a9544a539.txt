Goldman Sachs is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings before the opening bell Tuesday.

Here's what Wall Street expects:

Earnings: $7.69 per share, 49% lower than a year earlier, according to Refinitiv
Revenue: $11.41 billion, 16% lower than a year earlier.
Trading Revenue: Fixed Income $3 billion, Equities $2.59 billion
Investing Banking: $1.84 billion

Will Goldman's traders do well enough to offset weak investment banking results?

That's the question after mixed bank reports so far. While Wall Street rivals including JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley posted sharp declines in third-quarter investment banking revenue, better-than-expected fixed income results amid volatile markets helped buoy their institutional businesses.
