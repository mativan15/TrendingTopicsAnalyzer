ITV News' political editor Robert Peston made a slip-up while speaking on the programme last night, accidentally substituting Jeremy Hunt's surname for an uncouth swear word live on-air.
It's not the first time a news reporter has inadvertently said the C-word by mistake when referring to the now-Chancellor of the Exchequer, with a Sky News host doing the exact same thing just this summer.
