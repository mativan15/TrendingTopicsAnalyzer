KFC has an unexpected hit on its hands in China, and it's thanks to people being angry about the severe and ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns imposed by the government.As Reuters reports, on May 21 KFC started giving away Psyduck Pokemon models with meals as part of a promotion for Children's Day on June 1. Two days later, all the Psyduck models had gone and they started appearing on websites selling for as much as 1,300 yuan (roughly $195) each. Why so much? It turns out Psyduck makes for a good representation of how people are feeling on social media about lockdowns.
