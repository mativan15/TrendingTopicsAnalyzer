Bengaluru: Indian mobile esports and skill gaming platform Mobile League (MPL), which entered the unicorn club last September at a valuation of $2.3 billion, is laying off around 100 people and exiting the Indonesian market amid a slowdown in the Indian startup ecosystem. 'We have to achieve some outcomes like growing our core business while achieving Ebitda neutrality… and winding up businesses that are not working,' said Sai Srinivas, cofounder and chief executive officer of MPL, in an email to the company's employees on Monday.
