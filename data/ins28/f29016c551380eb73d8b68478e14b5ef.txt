(SOUNDBITE OF DROP ELECTRIC'S "WAKING UP TO THE FIRE")
ADRIAN MA, HOST: 
 This is THE INDICATOR FROM PLANET MONEY. I'm Adrian Ma.
WAILIN WONG, HOST: 
 And I'm Wailin Wong. Adrian, I wanted to propose a new season for us to celebrate here on THE INDICATOR - proxy season.
MA: Yeah, proxy season.
WONG: Proxy season - the time of year when publicly traded companies hold their annual stockholder meetings.
MA: Yeah, just imagine corporate executives running on stage with, like, hordes of shareholders screaming at them.
