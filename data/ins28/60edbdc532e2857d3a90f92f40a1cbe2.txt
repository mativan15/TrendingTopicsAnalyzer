The tests were carried out on mice, and unlike the old standard Omicron strain, the mice just suffered mild symptoms when exposed to the virus. This new strain of COVID-19 is a hybrid variety created by scientists at Boston University that is highly potent and has an 80 per cent chance of killing. Scientists conducted this study, but it has not gone down well with medical experts and scientists. Professor Shmuel Shapira, a leading scientist with the Israeli government, warned the scientists at Boston University not to play with fire and indulge in manipulated virus research that peers haven't monitored.
