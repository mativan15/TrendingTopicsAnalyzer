'The next global boom will be non-tech. But I have no clue whether it will be defence, energy, finance or real estate. But these are the probable areas the market might tilt towards,' says 
Raamdeo Agrawal, Chairman & Co-Founder, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd 
Is the Indian market decoupled from the global market?
 Decoupled is very bad… 
Is that a very bad word?
This is an interdependent world. 
So there is no possibility of decoupling?
No, there is this stiff relationship between say India and China or Russia and the rest of the world.
