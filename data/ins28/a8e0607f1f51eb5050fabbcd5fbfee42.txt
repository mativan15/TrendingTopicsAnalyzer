A couple of years ago I interviewed Nick Jones, the entrepreneur behind Soho House, the chain of exclusive members' clubs. The guy is a straight-up business genius, but I don't think he had been briefed about our meeting and, looking back, I gave him a hard time. When I wasn't making things awkward by bringing up the lack of racial diversity of the club's members then ('We have a very multicultured view of our membership,' came the nervous reply), I was asking why Soho House wasn't opening more clubs outside London, like in Birmingham.
