Just after the ‘ agninaksthatram' came to an end, many parts in Thoothukudi city and peripheries experienced showers on Sunday. The sudden rain not only brought in cheers, but also gave a big relief to the residents as the mercury was pretty high over the last two to three days even at mornings. The rain was much needed as it instantly brought down the temperature and the sky remained overcast.
