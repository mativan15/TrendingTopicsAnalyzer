AgenciesKader Khan was a force to reckon with in Bollywood cinema for his acting, dialogues and scripts. An actor par excellence, Kader Khan's comic timing was unparalleled, and at the same time, he was terrific as a villian. Khan, who was born in Kabul, Afghanistan, graduated from Ismail Yusuf College and then went on to become a professor of civil engineering. Kader Khan, who entered Bollywood in the 1970s, appeared in over 300 films. He breathed his last on the 31st of December 2018 in Canada.
