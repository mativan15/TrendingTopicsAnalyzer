After all that the Fort Myers area and Southwest Florida have been through after Hurricane Ian hit as a Category 4 storm on Sept. 28, someone winning the Florida lottery there would be most welcome.

Apparently, this has happened. And it's a big one.

The winners will split a $494 million jackpot, so each share is $247 million.

According to the Florida Lottery, one of two Mega Millions winning tickets from Friday night's drawing was purchased at the 7-Eleven on 2980 Colonial Blvd. in Fort Myers.
