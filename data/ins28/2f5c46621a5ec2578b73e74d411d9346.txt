A display of Union flags, to commemorate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations next week, unleashed a furore on social media, with several commentators comparing the sight to Nazi Germany. Remainer activist Femi Oluwole launched a furious attack on the Union flags on Regent Street, claiming while there is nothing wrong with flag decorations, it represents "blatant fascism". GB News host Patrick Christys took to the streets yesterday to interview Britons on their view of the flag and the furore surrounding it this week.
