Currency turmoil has forced Wise to increase its prices for the first time in two years.The London-based money-transfer business said yesterday that the average charge for customers to move money had risen to 0.64 per cent during the three months to the end of September, up three basis points on the quarter and two basis points compared with a year earlier.Wise's long-held ambition is for its fees to fall to zero, but Kristo Kaarmann, 42, the company's co-founder and chief executive, said prices had risen because of 'extreme macroeconomic conditions'.
