LONDON (AP) — Second-half goals from Harry Kane and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg maintained Tottenham's perfect home record in the English Premier League in beating Everton 2-0 on Saturday.

Kane fired his team in front with a 59th-minute penalty after being brought down by Jordan Pickford. Hojbjerg sealed the win late with a precise finish.

Tottenham was level on points with second-placed Manchester City.

It was Kane's third penalty this week after scoring one and missing one in the Champions League win against Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday.
