By PA Media Published: 07:34 EDT, 15 October 2022 | Updated: 07:34 EDT, 15 October 2022 A senior Tory MP has had the whip restored, after being suspended from his party for missing a confidence vote in the summer. Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, had the whip removed after he failed to vote for Boris Johnson's Government in a confidence vote in July. Mr Ellwood, a former minister, had argued he was unable to make it to the crucial vote as he struggled to travel back from a meeting with the president of Moldova.
