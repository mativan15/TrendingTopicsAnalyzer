Controversial Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia sparked controversy on Wednesday after tweeting that Canada's new gun control could allow for a Russian invasion.

The far-right lawmaker took a jab at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for a speech announcing the country's new proposed gun control measures.

This proposal, made on Monday, would essentially halt buying, selling, importing and overall transporting handguns, though those who already own them would be allowed to keep them.
