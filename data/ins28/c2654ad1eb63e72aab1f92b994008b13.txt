The Labour leader brought an urgent question to the House of Commons on Monday, asking the prime minister to tell MPs the reasons behind her decision to sack Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor. It was announced earlier in the day that Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, would be answering Keir Starmer's questioning instead of Liz Truss. 
'Where is the prime minister? Hiding away, dodging questions,' he said. Mordaunt responded with 'the PM is detained on urgent business'
