Pharmaceutical behemoth Pfizer (PFE 0.59%) has racked up successes during the COVID-19 outbreak, as the first to enter the market with a vaccine in December 2020 and a pill treatment in December 2021. Revenues have soared and look to remain strong through 2022. But the impressive growth of the past two years leaves Pfizer with the challenge of quickly generating new sources of revenue as pandemic sales tail off.
