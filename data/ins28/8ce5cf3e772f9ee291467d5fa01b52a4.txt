(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. exceeded analysts' estimates for profit and wireless subscriber growth, suggesting that mobile-service providers remain insulated from tighter consumer budgets.While the company may have dodged most of the effects of inflation, concerns about AT&T's cash supply remain. The company's $3.8 billion free cash flow in the third quarter came up short of the $4.28 billion average analyst projection, but AT&T still expects to reach its $14 billion target for the year. The company said it's ahead of schedule on wireless upgrades in part due to 'record levels' of spending on 5G and fiber-network build-outs in the first three quarters of the year.
