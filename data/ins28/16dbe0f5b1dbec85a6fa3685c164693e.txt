While health officials are now offering new incentives to attract paramedics to Labrador, one person already working there says he hasn't been paid money promised to him to build more expertise.

Chen Ukra moved to Happy Valley-Goose Bay from Ontario five years ago, and has called the community home ever since.

He is a paramedic at the Labrador Health Centre but is now considering leaving his job.
