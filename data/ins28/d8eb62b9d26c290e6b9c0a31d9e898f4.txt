franz12/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Germany's Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) has laid off 20 New York-based junior bankers and a number of senior staff within the lender's Origination & Advisory business, people familiar with the matter told the New York Post on Thursday. The job cuts came as the bank seeks to better manage costs in the wake of a broader slowdown in dealmaking activity spurred by rising interest rates and growing recession risks. Nevertheless, DB's O&A segment, which advises firms about prospective mergers and acquisitions and offers loans, has hired a mix of 15 managing directors and directors globally so far in 2022.
