Are you wondering if you have the background to succeed as a franchise owner? You'll be happy to know that franchisees come from a variety of occupations.

Kumon North America, an educational enrichment franchise, recently surveyed 237 franchisees at a Kumon conference about their educational and occupational backgrounds. The survey found that Kumon Instructors (franchisees), come from all walks of life – from architect to psychologist to marketing professional.

As you would expect for a franchise in the education industry, Kumon has a large percentage of franchise owners who come from an educational background: Almost 18 percent were previously teachers and 8 percent were school administrators.
