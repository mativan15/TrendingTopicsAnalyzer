Germany plans to cap electricity prices for households and industries to help them cope with soaring energy prices by trimming the profits of some producers, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing a draft document from the Economy Ministry.European power companies have enjoyed record profits this year due to soaring energy prices across the continent.The proposed scheme would reportedly be funded by a €200 billion ($196 billion) aid package for households and businesses to deal with the cost-of-living crisis, which the German government announced last month, and partly by the new profit tax.
