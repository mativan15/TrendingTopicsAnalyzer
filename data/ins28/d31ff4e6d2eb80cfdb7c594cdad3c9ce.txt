Published: 16:03 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 16:03 EDT, 2 June 2022 By Noel Randewich and Anisha Sircar June 2 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher on Thursday, led by Tesla, Nvidia and other megacap growth stocks in a choppy session ahead of a key jobs report due on Friday. Tesla, Nvidia and Meta Platforms each rose sharply, fueling gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Nearly all of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes climbed, led by consumer discretionary and communication services . U.S. stocks recovered from a drop earlier in the day after Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard said she backs at least a couple more half percentage point interest rate hikes, and sees little case for pausing rate hikes in September if price pressures fail to cool.
