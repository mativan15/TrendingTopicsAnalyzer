AMSTERDAM, June 02, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AM Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of B++ (Good) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of "bbb+" (Good) of Protector Forsikring ASA (Protector) (Norway). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.

These ratings reflect Protector's balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).

AM Best expects Protector's risk-adjusted capitalisation, as measured by Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), to be maintained at the strongest level, underpinned by strong earnings generation, which should adequately support the company's growth forecasts.
