Three weeks out from a midterm election that is beginning to look more and more like a big victory for Republicans, Democrats are starting to play the blame game.

Former President Obama stepped into the spotlight over the weekend by warning fellow Democrats and progressives not to be a 'buzzkill' by constantly scolding people for being politically incorrect.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is eyeing a potential run for president in 2024, says the party is spending too much time talking about abortion rights and not enough talking about economic inequality and that it didn't go big enough in passing legislation to help Americans struggling to afford health care, prescription drugs and other basic needs.
