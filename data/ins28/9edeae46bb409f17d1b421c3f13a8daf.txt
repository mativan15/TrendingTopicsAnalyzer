Comair, the South African operator of British Airways flights, has grounded all of its planes after running out of cash, the company said.

The carrier, which is under administration, also operates budget airline Kulula. Those planes are also grounded, with tickets sales for both airlines suspended.

Comair's administrators "have advised that the process to raise the necessary capital is in progress and that there is reason to believe such funding may be secured," the company said in the statement late Tuesday.
