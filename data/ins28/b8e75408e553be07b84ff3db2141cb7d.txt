Strictly Come Dancing is pushing EastEnders actor James Bye to his limit as he admits he is ‘in pain for the neck down'.
Just over a month into the competition, the intense training schedule has clearly caught up with Bye as he's revealed that his whole body is feeling the effects of learning a new dance routine every week. 
Speaking to Ranvir Singh on Lorraine on Thursday morning, Bye was asked ‘what bits' of his body are hurting, when he responded saying that it all was.
