American tech giant Meta, formerly the Facebook company, has received flak from US investor Michael Burry. Michael Burry claimed that Coca-Cola's problem is badly affecting the Meta. Burry was indicating a decision taken by the Coca-Cola company back in 1985. Where they updated the recipe for coke, but this decision was eventually cancelled, and they came back to their old recipe. And this decision is highlighted in bold letters as one of the most failed decisions in history.
 Burry did not elaborate in the tweet, and he suggests that, in his view, the primary focus of Meta's decision is to move from social media platforms.
