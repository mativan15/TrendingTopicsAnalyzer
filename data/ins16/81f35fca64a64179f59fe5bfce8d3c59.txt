Ultimately the best exercise bikes will be ones that motivate you to ride regularly. It can have all the functionality in the world, but if it leaves you uninspired to cycling at home, it'll end up gathering dust in a corner, or become an overpriced clothes horse.

From beginner to professional virtual e-sports cyclist, there is an exercise bike out there for you. Even if you already own one of the best road bikes, an indoor bike has huge benefits for every cyclist.

Some of the best exercise bikes will connect to the best indoor training apps for cycling and allow you to record your riding allowing you to track your progress in a similar way that the best power meters would, although some will require you to just wear a smartwatch or heart rate monitor and only give you a calorie burn indication.
