It was the question on a lot of lips yesterday.
Where was Boris Johnson when Liz Truss's leadership was coming to an end?
Was he reeling from the events of Wednesday night, when members of his party were accused of bullying and harassment before the vote to reverse the ban on fracking?
Did he use his vote to reaffirm his previously expressed ‘dubious' feelings over shale gas drilling? Or did he use his ballot as a de facto confidence vote in Liz Truss, a woman to whom he vowed to give his total support?
He did not.
