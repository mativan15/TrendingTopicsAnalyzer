My fave rain boots ever — up to 50% off at Amazon! (Photo: Amazon)

There are countless good reasons to wear rainbows but sadly only one real excuse to wear rain boots. I'll be wishing extra-hard for rain this Pride Month (hello, June!), because I want to splash around in my new rain boots as much as possible.

Honestly, I'll probably be stomping around in them anyway. They're so comfy and cute that I wore them on the driest day in May, just 'cause.
