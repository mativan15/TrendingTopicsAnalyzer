This month, one of the five, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), lives up to the dogcatcher ideal of annual dividends from $1K invested exceeding its single share price. Four others, however, showed prices within $15.21 of meeting that goal. With renewed downside market pressure of 66%, it would be possible for all ten (even AMGN) to become elite fair-priced dogs with their annual yield (from $1K invested) meeting or exceeding their single share prices by year's end.
