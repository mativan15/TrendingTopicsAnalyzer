Alonzo Weaver, Memphis, Light, Gas and Water's chief utility officer, said MLGW Board of Commissioners would likely vote on whether to sign a 20-year electricity contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority in November.

The utility had previously not set a date for when it would vote. Weaver told the audience of the planned vote at a public meeting Thursday. In response to follow-up questions from The Commercial Appeal, he said the vote would probably be at the board's second meeting of the month — Nov.
