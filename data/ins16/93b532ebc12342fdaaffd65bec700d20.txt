Over the last few months, drivers have experienced a climb of prices at the pump, and predictions show no signs of relief this summer.

As of Thursday, Missouri's gas price average was $4.30 for a gallon of regular, unleaded fuel, according to the Automobile Association of America. This price, a record high, is 13 cents more than Thursday of last week and $1.58 more than June 2 of last year.

The gas price average in Missouri had set or tied a record high for 22 consecutive days, as of Wednesday.
