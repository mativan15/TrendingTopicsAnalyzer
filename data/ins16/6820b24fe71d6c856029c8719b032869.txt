AUSTIN, Texas — Big Bertha II, a new bass drum custom-built for the Longhorn Band at The University of Texas at Austin, will debut at the Oct. 15 football game between Texas and Iowa State University. After 100 years of service, the original Big Bertha will make her final appearance alongside Big Bertha II before entering the Frank Denius Family University of Texas Athletics Hall of Fame. Both drums will be on the field for the first and only time during the halftime show, which will feature the Longhorn Band alongside the Longhorn Alumni Band.
