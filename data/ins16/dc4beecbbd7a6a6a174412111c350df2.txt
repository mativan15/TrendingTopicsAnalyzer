The 2022 World Cup gets underway in Qatar next month, with the England team – and the Wags – close to putting the final preparations in place.
The iconic summer tournament – which typically takes place every four years after the end of the club football season – is instead taking place as part of a ‘winter break' due to the heat in the host nation.
