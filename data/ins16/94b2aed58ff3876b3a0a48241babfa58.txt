Welcome, reader, to my inaugural newsletter. If you feel inspired to subscribe, I promise digressive comments on political questions, friendly rejoinders to critics, overly detailed arguments about Christianity and conservatism and the state of the West, a lot of writing about pop culture — television and the movies mainly — and perhaps just a bit of book promotion when I next manage to produce a book. The plan is to run this weekly in addition to my columns, with occasional weeks off for holidays and other interruptions, though it's possible that it will transition to semimonthly if I can't keep up the pace.
