Skyhobo/E+ via Getty Images Both Altria Group (NYSE:MO) and Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) have had a really volatile year indeed, given the 29.29% and 26.32% in price swings thus far, respectively. The former has Juul to thank for, worsened by Biden's ban on menthol cigarettes, along with the limitation in nicotine levels for US-sold cigarettes. Sales for Tobacco products are already on the decline, with E-cigarettes affected as well, given Juul's ongoing litigation with the US FDA, potentially putting a damper on the marketing and sales of the product in the overall tobacco market.
