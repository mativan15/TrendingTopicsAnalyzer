The Golden State Warriors have continued the mission to keep their championship core in place, with forward Andrew Wiggins agreeing a four-year, $109million contract extension.

Wiggins was entering the final year of his previous deal and will now be owed a total of $143million over the next five seasons.

The news, reported initially by ESPN, comes just hours after Golden State and Jordan Poole were revealed to have agreed to a four-year, $140million extension.

Wiggins was a crucial contributor to the Warriors title run in June, with the 27-year-old averaging 18.
