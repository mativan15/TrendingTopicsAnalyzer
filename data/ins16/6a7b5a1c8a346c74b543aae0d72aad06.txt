Australia's energy woes are mounting with the market operator warning of potential gas supply shortages on Thursday, one of the largest generators issuing a profit warning and more retailers turning away customers as wholesale power prices soar.Just hours after new treasurer, Jim Chalmers, warned of 'this perfect storm of energy price spikes … doing enormous damage to our employers, to our households, and to our national economy,' spot power prices were soaring towards $1,000 per megawatt hour in most of the east coast grid after an alert – now cancelled – that Victoria was facing evening reserve shortages.
