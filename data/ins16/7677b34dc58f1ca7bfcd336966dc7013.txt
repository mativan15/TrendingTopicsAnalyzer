Oct. 19—MAGGIE VALLEY — Just two months after winning a vigorous bidding war for Elevated Mountain Distilling, Kenneth Wells has put the property on the market.

The former distillery/music venue was foreclosed on by the lender, and Wells was the last man standing after three others opted out once the bid that started out at $364,450 reached $630,000.

Wells initially planned to lease the property to a distilling company that would manufacture spirits, operate a tasting room and offer retail sales, but has now put the property on the market.
