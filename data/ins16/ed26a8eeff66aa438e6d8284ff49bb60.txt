Liverpool reportedly believe that landing Jude Bellingham this summer will be especially tough given that Borussia Dortmund have only just lost star striker Erling Haaland. Monaco's Aurelien Tchouameni is viewed as an alternative, but the Reds are supposedly ready to down tools in their pursuit of the Frenchman as Real Madrid close in. Jurgen Klopp has his eyes on two of Europe's top midfield prospects, so signing either of them was never going to be simple. At 18-years-old, Bellingham is tipped to have a glittering future at club and international level, having already worked his way into Gareth Southgate's senior England set-up.
