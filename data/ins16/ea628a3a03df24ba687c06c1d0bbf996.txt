Mastercard is launching a program to let financial institutions offer cryptocurrency trading to their clients. The payments giant will act as a "bridge" between Paxos, a crypto trading platform already used by PayPal, and banks. Mastercard will handle regulatory compliance and security -- two core reasons banks cite for avoiding the asset class. "There's a lot of consumers out there that are really interested in this, and intrigued by crypto, but would feel a lot more confident if those services were offered by their financial institutions," says Jorn Lambert, Mastercard's chief digital officer.
