Now you do not require a smartphone or an internet connection to make UPI payments. It can be done via UPI 123PAY. Here is how. No matter what UPI payment making application (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm) you are using, you will require a smartphone and an internet connection to use them. But, what if we tell you that you can make UPI (Unified Payments Interface) payments without having any internet connection and even a smartphone. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has come up with an initiative called UPI 123Pay through which people who are using feature phones will be able to make payments without an internet connection.
