The hotel owner who banned Native Americans from her property in South Dakota two months ago was arrested today for assaulting protesters at a demonstration organized by NDN Collective.

Connie Uhre, 75, the owner of the Grand Gateway Hotel in Rapid City, was charged with three counts of simple assault by the Rapid City Police Department for spraying what appeared to be a cleaning agent in the faces of several people outside the hotel.

Uhre's arrest was confirmed by Warren Poaches, a spokesperson for the Rapid City police.
