LeoPatrizi/E+ via Getty Images My investment rating for SK Telecom Co., Ltd's (NYSE:SKM) [017670:KS] stock is a Buy. In my previous August 16, 2021 update for SKM, I reviewed SK Telecom's Q2 2022 financial performance. With this latest update, I discuss about the multiple positives for SK Telecom. Firstly, profit margins for SK Telecom's mobile business should expand going forward as competition between SKM and its rivals becomes less intense. Secondly, SKM is actively exploring new growth opportunities outside of its core mobile business, with its data centers and subscription services expected to be key drivers for the future.
