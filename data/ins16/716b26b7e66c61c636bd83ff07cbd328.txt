Rimac Group, the Croatian maker of exotic electric supercars that now controls Bugatti, announced that it received €500 million, or about $536 million in new investment. Among those involved in the new investment round is Porsche, which already owns about one quarter of the company. 
 

 Rimac was founded in 2009 as Rimac Automobili, with a goal of producing high-horsepower electric supercars. The company also contracted with other automakers, such as Aston Martin and Sweden's Koenigsegg, to develop and produce high-performance electric drive components for high-end cars.
