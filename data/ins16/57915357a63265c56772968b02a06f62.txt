Tony Parker remembers the team dinner on June 13, 2013, as one of the worst of his life.The San Antonio Spurs had just lost Game 6 of the NBA Finals to the Miami Heat, 103-100, quite literally letting a championship slip through their fingers.In one of the most iconic finishes in NBA Finals history, the Spurs led the Heat, 94-89, with 28 seconds left, only to let Miami hit two three-pointers — including Ray Allen's famous game-tying three with five seconds left — to force overtime.The Spurs were so close to sealing the championship that American Airlines Arena staff were preparing for the trophy presentation.
