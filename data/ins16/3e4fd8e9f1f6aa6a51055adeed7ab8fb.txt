AgenciesHalloween events usually start in August in theme parks, and Great America in Santa Clara has revamped its Halloween celebration. This year, instead of the super scary adult-tailored Halloween Haunt, California's Great America Theme Park has introduced a new family-friendly Halloween experience called Tricks and Treats. Tricks and Treats is a more fun celebration than the park's earlier events. The Halloween event has divided the park into four unique Halloween-themed zones that use the street ambience, entertainment, food and decoration to create distinct Halloween experiences.
