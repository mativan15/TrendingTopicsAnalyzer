The Detroit Lions need to worry about stopping CeeDee Lamb during their Week 7 contest with the Dallas Cowboys.

Dallas Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb has emerged as one of the best pass-catchers in the game today.

The third-year pro has garnered north of 70 catches, more than 900 receiving yards and at least five touchdown catches in each of his first two seasons in the league.

Additionally, a year ago, he amassed a career-best 1,102 receiving yards, en route to earning his first trip to the Pro Bowl.
