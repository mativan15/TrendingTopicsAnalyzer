UK authorities are in talks to reopen a key natural gas storage facility to tackle the energy crunch that has gripped the country and the rest of Europe, according to unnamed sources as quoted by Bloomberg.The government and Centrica, a British multinational energy and services company are reportedly discussing stashing the fuel away at the Rough offshore depot before it is converted to store hydrogen in the future.Back in 2017, Britain's top energy supplier said it would close Rough, which accounted for nearly 70% of the country's gas storage capacity.
