The preliminary test conducted by the Telangana State Public Service Commission (TSPSC) for recruitment to Group-I cadre posts concluded peacefully in the Cyberabad police limits. There were 121 exam centres in the jurisdiction limits and police ensured adequate bandobust arrangements for an incident-free day. The Traffic Task Force (TTF) — motorcycle-borne traffic officials in charge of regulating traffic and preventing violations — offered timely help to candidates taking the exam.
