The Co Carlow market town of Tullow is thriving: it has a large catchment area of good agricultural land and the main street looks prosperous. In the central square is Thrive Hub — the digital co-working space I've come to visit — but it is tucked in above the irresistible Thrive café, full of healthy organic and delicious foods, so that's where I start out, with its owner Helen Demetriou.The name is Greek Cypriot, but Demetriou is Tullow born and bred; she met her Irish husband, Michael Demetriou (of Greek extraction), in Australia.
