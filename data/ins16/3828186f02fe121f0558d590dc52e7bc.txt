Ethnic arts and crafts have become a profitable rural industry, lifting villages in Hunan province out of poverty and contributing to rural vitalisation.About 97.5 per cent of villagers in Hequn, Zhangjiajie city, in the province's north west, are members of the Bai ethnic group. Many of the Bai people are making a living selling cloth made with tie-dyeing, a method that calls for colours or patterns to be applied to textiles that they use to make their traditional clothing.About half the villagers in Hequn recently took part in a workshop on tie-dyeing organised by Zhang Pihe, 43, a Bai woman born in Dali, Yunnan province.
