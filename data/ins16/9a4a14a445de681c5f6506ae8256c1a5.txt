By PA Media Published: 03:51 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 03:51 EDT, 30 May 2022 Eurovision Song Contest winners Kalush Orchestra have auctioned off their trophy to raise money for the Ukrainian army. The band, whose song Stefania was triumphant in Turin earlier this month, said they raised 900,000 dollars (£713,000) by auctioning off the glass microphone, and a further 370,000 dollars (£293,000) by raffling off the pink bucket hat frontman Oleh Psiuk wore during the performance. The winning bid for the trophy was attributed to Whitebit, a cryptocurrency exchange, and came in the form of 500 Ethereum.
