What's this news coming out of Pakistan now?
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the state agency that runs Pakistani elections, has disqualified Imran Khan, the former Prime Minister — Pakistani media said he has been 'de-seated' as member of the National Assembly, which is the lower House of the country's Parliament.
So what? Is that a big deal?
It is! Consider these circumstances.
Imran had been dragged from power kicking and screaming after he was defeated in a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly on April 10, and he has kept up a relentless barrage of attacks on the coalition government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ever since.
