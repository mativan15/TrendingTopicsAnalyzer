Kolkata: The Srei Group's net worth has eroded fully after posting two consecutive years of net losses, even as it reported a ₹325 crore consolidated net profit in the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31, riding on recovery of loans and a sharp fall in expenses. Consequently, it has not been able to comply with various regulatory ratios and limits. "The group had reported net losses for the year ended March 31, 2022, and the earlier year as well. Hence, net worth has fully eroded," said the administrator for the company, which is running into liquidation.
