Downing Street has insisted that Liz Truss remains in charge of the government, amid speculation that chancellor Jeremy Hunt has become the true power behind the throne.The prime minister's official spokesperson denied suggestions that Ms Truss had been 'forced' by her chancellor to accept the reversal of the bulk of her mini-Budget, insisting the decision was made jointly by the pair in discussions over the weekend.Reports have suggested that Mr Hunt would take a 'chief executive' role in the government, with responsibility for day-to-day decisions, while Ms Truss will be more of a 'chairman' with oversight duties.
