Sheryl Sandberg announced in a Facebook post Wednesday that her 14-year tenure with Meta (formerly known as Facebook) has come to an end.In 2008, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recruited Sandberg, who had served at Google, to come in and build the advertising business, which targets ads based on the personal data the platform aggressively collects from a user pool that's now swelled to nearly three billion. Sandberg's power in the company only increased, and she continued to make strategic decisions collaboratively with Zuckerberg.
