Stocks halted a two-day rally, with Treasury yields climbing to multiyear highs on speculation the Federal Reserve will remain hawkish, raising the odds of a recession. Not even the bright spots on the earnings front like Netflix Inc., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co. were able to enthuse traders about a continuation of this week's rally. One of the reasons is that going into the current season, estimates had already been cut to the bone. So beating forecasts wouldn't be so hard.
