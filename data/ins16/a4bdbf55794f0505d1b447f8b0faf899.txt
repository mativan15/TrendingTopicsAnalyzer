Eastlake Brewery owner Ryan Pitman is seeing business boom at other breweries, but customers still don't order rounds into the night at his spot in the Midtown Global Market on Lake Street. "Once it's dark, people leave," Pitman said. "Things have been slow to come back to the level before the riots." After being in the center of the unrest after George Floyd's murder by a Minneapolis police officer two years ago, Lake Street still faces an image problem. "I think the perception is going to have to change and that's going to continue to happen with the rebuilding of Lake Street," the brewery owner said.
