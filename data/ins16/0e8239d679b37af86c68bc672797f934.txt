Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Tuesday, with the abrupt reversal in the U.K. government's fiscal thinking helping boost sentiment after weeks of turmoil.

At 02:00 ET (06:00 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.7%.

New British finance minister Jeremy Hunt on Monday scrapped almost all of Prime Minister Liz Truss's previously-announced tax and spending measures later Monday, reducing concerns about the size of the increased borrowing needed to fund the plans.
