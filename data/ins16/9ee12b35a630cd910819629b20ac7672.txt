The European Union is considering paying for Elon Musk's Starlink internet services in Ukraine — a service key for wartime communication — over fears the billionaire may cut it off abruptly, Politico reported Monday. The issue was raised by the EU's chief diplomat Josep Borrell at a Monday EU meeting of foreign ministers, Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, told Politico. The discussions are at an early stage. This is days after CNN reported that Elon Musk's SpaceX had requested the Pentagon to fund the satellite internet service in Ukraine, due to costs.
