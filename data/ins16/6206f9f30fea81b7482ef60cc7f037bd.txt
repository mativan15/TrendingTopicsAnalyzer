PTIJammu: Kashmiri Pandit families return to Jagti Migrants Camp in the wake of recent killings of employees in Kashmir by terrorists, in Jammu.Srinagar: Prominent representatives of Kashmiri Pandits on Sunday alleged that the bureaucracy in Jammu and Kashmir is unable to resolve the ongoing crisis. They alleged that the civil society and political stakeholders who could have played a role in resolving these issues have been rendered defunct by the government over the past three years. "There is a lull and nobody knows who is the next target except The Resistance Front, who are issuing threat letters and executing targeted attacks," said Sanjay Tickoo, who heads the Kashmir Pandit Sangharsh Samiti -- an organisation of Kashmiri Pandits who stayed back in the Valley even after the exodus in the late 1980s.
