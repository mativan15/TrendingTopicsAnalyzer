Group organic sales [1] grew by 3% YoY driven primarily by Networks in North America. Reported sales were SEK 68.0 (56.3) b., of which Vonage contributed SEK 2.9 b. since July 21.

Gross income increased to SEK 28.1 (24.8) b. driven by higher sales primarily in Networks, and the consolidation of Vonage.
