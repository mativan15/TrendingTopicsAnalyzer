Carvana (CVNA 0.82%) stock had only a ho-hum day on Tuesday, dragging slightly behind the broader stock market. The big auto retailer's shares bumped up only slightly, not quite hitting the 1% mark while the S&P 500 index motored past that particular traffic light. The chief culprit was an analyst's recommendation downgrade. 
So what
We can now count Wedbush prognosticator Seth Basham as no longer in the bull pen of Carvana analysts. 
Not only did Basham knock his recommendation on the stock down to neutral from the previous outperform (buy, in other words), he also took a big ax to his price target.
