The Wrap Should 'Inside Amy Schumer' Season 5 be considered a legacy revival? While the show's time off the air hasn't been quite as extensive as later-season revivals like 'Arrested Development' or 'The X-Files,' six and a half years can feel like an eternity in popular and political culture, especially when accompanied by a worldwide pandemic. Schumer herself must be particularly aware of the fullness of this time; when Season 4 of the show debuted in spring 2016, she was fresh off a big hit movie 'Trainwreck' and a moment in the cultural zeitgeist; an ongoing Comedy Central sketch series seemed almost charmingly small-scale for such an ascendant star.
