Last spring, wrist surgery cost St. John's small forward Julian Champagnie a chance at getting drafted. This spring, Champagnie is hoping COVID-19 hasn't cost him a chance at going in the June 23 draft. 
After working out for three teams last spring, including his hometown Nets, Champagnie chose to return to St. John's for his junior year. 
His twin brother, Justin, left Pittsburgh, wasn't drafted but signed with the Raptors and got into 36 games as a rookie. 
Meanwhile, the Red Storm had a rough going in 2021-22 and Champagnie didn't help his stock much despite scoring 19.
