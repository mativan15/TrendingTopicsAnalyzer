Luke Shaw believes Manchester United "need" Lisandro Martinez in their defence after the Argentine's superb start to his Old Trafford career. Martinez, 24, joined United from Ajax in a £57million deal in July. Standing at 5ft 9in, some pundits and fans insisted he wasn't big enough to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League - especially after the 4-0 defeat to Brentford in August. Yet Martinez has since silenced his critics with several quality performances. He's kept five clean sheets in 13 games since that famous loss, forming a brilliant partnership with Raphael Varane and leaving captain Harry Maguire battling to regain his starting spot.
