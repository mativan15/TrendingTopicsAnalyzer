Compared to much of the market, healthcare stock Cigna (CI) has held up fairly well. The equity boasts a 15.2% year-to-date lead, and has even managed to cling to a positive year-over-year return. While the security has taken a breather since touching a fresh annual high of $273.57 during last Tuesday's session, there's reason to believe a trendline sitting just below could put additional wind in CI's sails this June. Cigna stock just pulled back within one standard deviation of its 40-day moving average after a lengthy period above the trendline.
