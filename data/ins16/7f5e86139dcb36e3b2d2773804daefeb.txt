In one of the biggest deals in the history of the US grocery industry, Kroger last week said that it plans to buy rival Albertsons for $24.6 billion.

The deal will allow Kroger to better compete with Walmart, which is the biggest player in the industry, owning some 22% of the US grocery market. Commanding greater market share will allow Kroger to better negotiate better rates with suppliers and invest more in technology to reduce costs. If combined, Kroger and Albertsons would make up 13% of the US grocery sales and reach some 85 million households across the US.
