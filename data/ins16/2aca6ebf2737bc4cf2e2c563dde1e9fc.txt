The Wisconsin election review has cost nearly $900,000 so far, going beyond its original budget

The cost will continue to rise, in part because of a spate of lawsuits related to the work. Despite spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal fees, Republicans have lost a series of court rulings over the last year. Republicans in the state Assembly last summer launched their review of the presidential election even though recounts and court rulings had found Wisconsin officials had properly called the race for Joe Biden over Donald Trump.
