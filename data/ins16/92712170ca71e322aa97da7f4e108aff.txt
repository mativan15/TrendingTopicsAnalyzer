Drew Barrymore hasn't been in an ‘intimate relationship' since her marriage ended in 2016.
The 47-year-old actress – who has daughters Olive, 10, and eight-year-old Frankie with her ex-husband Will Kopelman – admitted her ‘view on sex has truly changed' since she was a young woman seeking ‘validation' through intimacy, although she doesn't regret her past experiences.
Writing in a blog on her talk show's website, she said: ‘At nearly 48 I have very different feelings about intimacy than I did growing up.
