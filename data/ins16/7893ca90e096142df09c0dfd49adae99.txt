barbaraaaa/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is likely to be one of the main beneficiaries as investment firm Wedbush Securities noted a "clear improvement" in the supply chain in Asia over the past week. Analyst Dan Ives noted that Apple (AAPL), as well as "other chip players," are likely to be the main beneficiaries from the aforementioned improvements, calling it a "much needed positive heading into [the second half.]" "While spots around zero Covid are popping up in China, we are seeing a strong production trajectory heading into June for stalwart names such as Apple (good for iPhone 14 ramp) and Tesla (TSLA) which are key barometers for the overall market on this painful hot button supply chain issue which has been a black cloud over the tech/automotive sector the last 6 months," Ives wrote in a note to clients.
