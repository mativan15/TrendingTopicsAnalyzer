A Campbell River, B.C., family's fight to officially register their son's Indigenous name with the province is heating up. Crystal Smith and her husband Raymond Shaw have been hoping to name their nine-month-old son λugʷaləs, pronounced "Glu-go-lus." Back in April, the couple spoke with CTV News when they were first trying to register their son's name with the B.C. government. But after months without a response, the couple has now taken the matter to the B.C. Supreme Court. At the time, the couple was told that the province couldn't accommodate the unique characters in the name.
