Spring Lake's current financial issues were caused in part because the town tried to spend money from its savings account that wasn't there, a state official said.

David Erwin of the state Local Government Commission and Interim Town Manager Joe Durham presented Spring Lake's proposed budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1 to the town Board of Aldermen on Wednesday. The commission took over Spring Lake's finances in October after state officials became concerned that the town could not meet its financial obligations.
