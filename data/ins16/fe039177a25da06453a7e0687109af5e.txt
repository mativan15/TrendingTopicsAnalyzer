Liz Truss's resignation as U.K. Prime Minister after just 44 days in office received the latest in a barrage of cruel verdicts from the City of London. The pound rallied and government bond prices jumped as investors hoped that a period of political calm and relative fiscal prudence would follow. 'Although Truss was brought into usher in an era of growth and ‘trickle-down economics', her strong pro-growth policy was poorly timed, sending the U.K. bond markets into a sharp sell off as her policies fanned the flames of surging inflation,' said Giles Coghlan, chief market analyst at broker HYCM.
