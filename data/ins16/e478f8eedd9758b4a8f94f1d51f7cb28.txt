The Cheltenham Festival 2023 is upon us soon. The home of jumps racing is about to host its first act of the season. While this event doesn't have graded races, it's a nest for possible winners, as 17 horses in the last 13 years ran at this meet before winning the big race in March. Coole Cody is also a member of that group, having ended 2nd in a Class 3 handicap hurdle last October and then winning the Grade 3 Plate Handicap Chase after five months. He also reappears in the same race on Friday at 15:35.
