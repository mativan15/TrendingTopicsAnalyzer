Question about the event
Ambassador Degnan:  I'm very glad to be here today for a very important event on women in the energy sector. This is an important area because research shows that companies with more women in leadership positions are more profitable and perform better, and this is true globally.  But across the world also globally, we see that there's a real shortage of women in the energy sector in particular. This is not unique to Georgia, this is across the globe. At a time when we are trying to shift to renewables and new ways of finding energy, it is even more important that we see gender diversity in energy companies because innovation is another area where more women in leadership positions produce greater innovation and efficiencies.
