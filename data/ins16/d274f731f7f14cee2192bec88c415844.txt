VISAKHAPATNAM: Janasena president Pawan Kalyan on Sunday said his party has taken permission for its Jana Vaani (people's voice) programme, which was originally scheduled to be held on Sunday, three months before the YSRCP announced its ‘ Visakha Garjana ' rally schedule.He told media here that he was in Visakhapatnam for Jana Vaani programme to receive grievances from the public and to resolve them, but not to compete with the YSRCP's programmes or the party itself.Our political battle with any party is limited to only elections,' said the actor-turned-politician.
