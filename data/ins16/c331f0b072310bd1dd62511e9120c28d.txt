When Sheryl Sandberg joined Facebook in 2008, she knew she was committing to more than your typical 9-to-5 job.But the departing Meta COO says she didn't realize the "24/7" job would last 14 years. CNBC's Julia Boorstin recently caught up with Sandberg, who said she initially only expected to stay at Facebook for five years – and that her commitment to the company left little time for philanthropic projects or other personal interests."It's a job that I love, but it's 24/7," Sandberg, 52, said, shortly after she announced she was stepping down as COO in a Facebook post yesterday.
