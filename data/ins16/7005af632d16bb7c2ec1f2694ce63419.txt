(This story originally appeared in on Oct 19, 2022)On the eve of the results of the Congress presidential poll, underdog candidate Shashi Tharoor's camp has complained to the election authority about alleged violations of voting guidelines as well as management of booth during the voting on Monday. Veteran Mallikarjun Kharge is the front runner to win the top post in Congress. Sources said Tharoor's campaign manager Salman Soz has sent a complaint documenting the violations. The complaint has specifically pointed to UP for what it has called as "egregious" overreach by organisational leaders.
