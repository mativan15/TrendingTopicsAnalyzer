SAN FRANCISCO — Calling it a "long" couple of weeks, Golden State guard Jordan Poole is ready to chase a repeat championship alongside Draymond Green after the fourth-year pro took a punch to the face from Green at practice.

Poole wasn't injured by the violent punch Oct. 5. Green rejoined the team after a leave of absence, and he met with Poole in the days before they played together again Friday night against the Nuggets.

"He apologized, and we plan on handling ourselves that way, we're going to play basketball," Poole said Sunday in his first public remarks since the fight and after video leaked from the incident.
