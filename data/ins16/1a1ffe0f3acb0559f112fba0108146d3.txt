Theatre groups in India, even the successful ones, typically do not have life spans of beyond a couple of decades. So it is something of a landmark when a theatre group enters its 50th year, as the Delhi-based Jana Natya Manch (Janam) did this March.Over these years, Janam has produced some 120-odd plays, performed them some 8,000 times, in over 300 cities and villages of India. Many of these plays have become classics of political street theatre— Machine (1978),  Aurat (1979),  Halla Bol (1988),  Gopi Gavaiyya Bagha Bajaiyya (1994),  Voh Bol Uthi (2001),  Yeh Dil Mange More Guruji (2002),  Andher Nagari (2021).
