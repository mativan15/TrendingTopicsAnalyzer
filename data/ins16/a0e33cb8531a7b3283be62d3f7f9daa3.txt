Oct. 19—GRANDVIEW — After slicing through the rest of District 7-3A Division I like a hot knife through butter, the Grandview Zebras and West Trojans will meet for district supremacy Friday in a highly anticipated tilt between Class 3A powers.

Neither Grandview (6-1, 5-0) or West (6-1, 5-0) have been tested in district play. The average margin of victory in district play for the No. 3-ranked Zebras so far is 62.4 points per game while the Trojans' average margin of victory is 54.4 points.

Grandview Coach Ryan Ebner said they're excited for Friday's matchup against an opponent they have tremendous respect for.
