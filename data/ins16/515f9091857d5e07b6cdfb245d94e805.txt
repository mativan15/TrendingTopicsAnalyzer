Liz Truss has announced her resignation as Prime Minister, triggering a fresh Tory leadership contest which will be concluded 'within the next week'. 
Sir Keir Starmer responded to Ms Truss's resignation by repeating his call for an immediate general election. Echoing the Labour leader's sentiment were the Lib Dems, SNP and many Telegraph readers.
Readers did not refrain from expressing their bemusement at the current state of affairs in government. However, they were divided in their opinions over whether Ms Truss's ousting was justified and who the next Tory leader should be.
