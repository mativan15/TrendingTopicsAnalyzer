In many countries, including Britain, children have become very expensive to raise and, as Professor Geeta Nargund, president of the International Society for Mild Approaches in Assisted Reproduction, wrote in a 2009 paper on declining birth rates in developed countries, 'children often can become an economic drain caused by housing, education cost and other cost[s]'.
The 2007/08 financial crash didn't help. 'Particularly in Europe [this] led to… unemployment [and] poor accumulation of wealth by young adults,' says Lyman Stone, chief information officer at Demographic Intelligence.
