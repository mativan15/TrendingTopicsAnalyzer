ANALYSIS: Days after the Government unveiled its plan to price and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from farmers, activist group Groundswell announced today's protest. Protest leaders hope to kill a new policy to introduce levies on the planet-heating methane and nitrous oxide gases produced by farms. The Government intends to build a basic calculator to determine the emissions of individual farms, charge a levy on that greenhouse pollution from 2025, while offering discounts for green behaviours – a system looking a lot like the proposal put together by sector and Māori representatives.
