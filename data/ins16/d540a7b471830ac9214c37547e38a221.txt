Bengaluru: Startup founders must not see initial public offerings (IPOs) as another route for their next round of funding as they face pressure from venture capitalists to succeed as early as possible, said NR Narayana Murthy, founder of . 'IPOs have been taken as the surrogate for the next round of financing. It is not a good thing (for the ecosystem) as it comes with tremendous responsibility,' the IT industry doyen said at an international conference on startups here on Friday.

When Infosys went public in 1993, its cofounders had 'onerous' responsibility of giving stable returns to shareholders, Murthy said.
