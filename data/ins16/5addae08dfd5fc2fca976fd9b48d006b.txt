Published: 16:59 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 17:00 EDT, 20 October 2022 Coach Buzz Williams is still looking for his first NCAA Tournament appearance as he begins his fourth season at Texas A&M. In case anyone is wondering, he doesn´t regret calling out the tournament committee for what he perceived as a snub of his Aggies last season after they didn´t get a NCAA bid despite reaching the the SEC tourney final. "I´m going to always do that, regardless of what Twitter says or the opinions of others," he said.
