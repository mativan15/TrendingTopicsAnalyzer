Nearly a decade after acquiring the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers, Steve Ballmer is finally realizing his dream to build a bigger and better TV platform for his beloved basketball franchise. The Clippers today are launching ClipperVision, a regional subscription streaming service that offers six channel options for watching the vast majority of the team's home and away games – more than 70 out of 84 regular season games. The service will cost $199 per season and is available largely in Southern California.
