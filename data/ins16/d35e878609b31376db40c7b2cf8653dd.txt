The event – Israel's only one dedicated to the United States' Memorial Day – took place at the KKL-JNF's 9/11 Living Memorial in Arazim Valley. The monument features a 30-foot-tall bronze sculpture shaped like the American flag and lists the names of the victims who perished in the September 11th attacks.

'For [Israel] to recognize the importance of our relationship and the United States is something that's incredibly meaningful,' Ducey told The Media Line.
