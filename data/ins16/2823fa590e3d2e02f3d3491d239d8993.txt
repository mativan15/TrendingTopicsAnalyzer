Staff writers David La Vaque and Jim Paulsen, in their annual competition of predicting winners of high school football games, did nothing to separate themselves in Week 7, and that makes matters exciting for Week 8. Jim is 15-9 and David 14-10, and they don't agree on a thing about the last games of the regular season.

Their Week 8 picks and analysis:

Class 6A: No. 4 Eden Prairie Eagles (5-2) at No. 3 Stillwater Ponies (7-0), 7 p.m.

Jim says: Last seasonStillwater was undefeated going into its season finale at Eden Prairie, seeking validation of its perfection.
