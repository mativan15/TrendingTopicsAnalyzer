We're not to the mid point of the NFL season, but this matchup between the Indianapolis Colts and Tennessee Titans carries unusual importance.

Indianapolis is almost out of opportunities to gain an edge on AFC South opponents. Though the Colts (3-2-1) would be in the playoffs if the season ended before Sunday, they're just 1-2-1 against division opponents.

According to the New York Times, if the Colts win Sunday, they have a 73% chance of making the AFC playoffs. If they lose, those chances drop to 47%.
