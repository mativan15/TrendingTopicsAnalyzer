OAKLAND — In a victory for tenants, the Oakland City Council voted Tuesday to cap rent increases at 3% instead of 6.7%, which the current law would have allowed come July.
'Tenants are facing an unprecedented rent hike,' Councilmember Carroll Fife, who proposed the change to limit the rent increase, said before the vote Tuesday as she urged her colleagues to approve it.
Under rent control policy in Oakland, the city allows for an annual rent increase based on the Consumer Price Index, or inflation.
