The holiday season is a time for traditions, for casting our eyes back to the comfortable memories of days gone by, for reviving old and questionably beloved IP to stick on your streaming service (see last month's Disney+ premier of Hocus Pocus 2).In November, Disney+ is transforming two films from its back catalog into shows. Willow (Nov. 30) returns to the world of Ron Howard and George Lucas's same-titled 1988 fantasy flick for more adventures of the short-statured, big-hearted hero. The film doesn't strike me as being universally beloved (I saw it in the theater at around age 7 and didn't like it then; upon a recent rewatch, I was mostly shocked by how violent it is), but Disney's algorithm must know something I don't, as the trailer makes it clear they've put a lot of money into this thing.
