Shares of Silvergate Capital Corp (SI) dropped more than 20% Tuesday after it announced that its stablecoin won't roll out before year-end.

The stock was already under pressure earlier Tuesday after the bank reported its clients didn't exchange digital assets during the 'crypto winter' as briskly as they did in previous quarters, according to its earnings release.

Silvergate shares lost $14.39 per share to $56 midday Tuesday.

Silvergate had planned to debut a new stablecoin payments initiative built from purchased assets of META's failed stablecoin project, Diem.
