FRACKING is set to continue in the UK in a massive energy boost to cash-strapped Brits following a crunch vote in Parliament tonight.
Labour had looked to use a vote in Parliament to force the introduction of a draft law to ban fracking.
But the motion was defeated by 326 votes to 230, with a majority of 96.
However, in a blow for embattled Prime Minister Liz Truss, rumours came out immediately afterwards that the Government's Chief Whip Wendy Morton and her Deputy Chief Whip had both resigned.
This followed a letter from the Chief Whip issued to all Conservative MPs to vote down the motion, calling it a vote of confidence in the government.
