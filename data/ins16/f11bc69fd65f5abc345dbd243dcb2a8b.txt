Jun. 4—New housing opportunities and future state grant money hang in the balance as Kern County government prepares to decide on a proposal that would reclassify far-flung swaths of vacant land for potential development into apartment complexes.

The county's Planning Commission is being asked to rezone about 214 acres — 61 parcels from the Antelope Valley to Lake Isabella to Belridge — to accommodate 14,965 units of high-density residential so Kern can avoid falling out of compliance with state housing requirements.
