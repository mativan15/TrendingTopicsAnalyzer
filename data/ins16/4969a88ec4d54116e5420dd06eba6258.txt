On Thursday, October 20, the final report of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) was published which found institutions had repeatedly prioritised their own reputations over the protection of children. Across 15 investigations, a research programme, and the Truth Project – a unique feature that gave victims and survivors the chance to be heard and tell their story – the IICSA found appalling abuse had taken place at a number of institutions including the Catholic Church, the Church of England, and Westminster.
