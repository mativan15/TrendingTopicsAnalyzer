Knowing when it's time to say "I'm sorry" is a start — but those words alone don't make a complete apology. A good apology is one in which you recognize and acknowledge the behavior, recognize and empathize with the other person's experience, and commit to doing something differently in the future. "Each of these steps is so important and people get each one wrong in a myriad of ways," explains Marina Gershkovich, assistant professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University Medical Center. For example, making excuses or offering a blanket apology can make it hard to distinguish whether you actually understand and take full responsibility for what you did.
