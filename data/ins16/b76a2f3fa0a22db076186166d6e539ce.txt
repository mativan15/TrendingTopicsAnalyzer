Sharechat, a short-video social media platform owned by Bengaluru-based Mohalla Tech Pvt Ltd, has asked independent Indian news organisation The Wire to take down its January 2022 report on an app called Tek Fog , which it said had been published without any supporting evidence. The report had claimed that Tek Fog enabled the spread of fake news and political propaganda through Sharechat. This comes after The Wire had to take down its investigative report on social network Meta about how certain individuals from the ruling party at the Centre had a say in removing content from Meta's platforms.
