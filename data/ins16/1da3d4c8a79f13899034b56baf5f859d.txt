A Nashville-based developer recently bought 4 acres of land approved for a condominium project on Carver Lane in Lebanon.

Wilson County records show Carver Retreat LLC, registered to local developer Tom McCormick, paid $2 million for the property on Oct. 7. The company also secured a $1.05 million loan against the property from Alabama-based CB&S Bank.

McCormick could not immediately be reached for comment.

Lebanon city planning documents show the property is approved for the development of 60 condos spread across two three-story buildings.
