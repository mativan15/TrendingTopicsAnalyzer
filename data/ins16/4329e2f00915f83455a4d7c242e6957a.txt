When Sylvia Young stepped on as president and CEO of HealthOne, her predecessor gave her some advice that she plans to pass on: Be strategic about how you choose to spend your time.

It sounds easier said than done for a woman who, over the past ten years, has led more than 11,000 employees in hospitals, health centers, ambulatory surgery centers and more across Colorado and Kansas for the Continental Division of HCA Healthcare Inc. (NYSE: HCA).

Young announced Thursday that she will retire at the end of the year, completing a 35-year career with HealthOne that began at Aurora Presbyterian Hospital.
