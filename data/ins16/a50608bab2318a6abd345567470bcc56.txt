Olivier Le Moal Treasury yields (NYSEARCA:TBT) (NASDAQ:TLT) (SHY) are breaking out to decade highs Wednesday, with the 10-year (US10Y) topping 4.10% for the first time since 2008. The tumble in bond prices has meant that even while stock (NYSEARCA:SPY) (QQQ) (DIA) (IWM) (IWB) valuations have tumbled, equity valuations relative to bonds haven't followed, MKM strategist Michael Darda highlighted in a note. The "equity risk premium (the valuation gap between the earnings yield on stocks and the yield on Treasuries) has actually fallen since the market topped in January," Darda wrote.
