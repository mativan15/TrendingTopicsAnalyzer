Five Australian women allegedly strip searched at gunpoint at Doha Airport after a baby was found in a bathroom have sued the Qatari government for assault and battery.

Hundreds of women were forcibly removed from aircraft at Doha on October 2, 2020 as officials searched for the mother of a newborn baby in a bathroom at the terminal.

Surveillance camera footage obtained by the website Doha News shows officials care for an abandoned baby at Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar on October 2, 2020.
