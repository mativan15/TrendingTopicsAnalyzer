Britain's government said some coal-fire power plants that were due to close later this year may need to stay open to help ensure electricity supply this winter.Countries across Europe are drawing up contingency plans in case of major disruptions to flows of Russian gas following its invasion of Ukraine, with Russia typically supplying around 40 per cent of Europe's gas.'In light of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, it is only right that we explore a wide range of options to further bolster our energy security and domestic supply,' a government spokesperson said via e-mail on Monday.
