‘Are you guys ready to have some fun?' yelled Knives Out creator Rian Johnson as he introduced the London Film Festival premiere of his follow-up.
Hell, yeah! 
And boy, did Johnson deliver. His Glass Onion is the year's most ingeniously entertaining movie. 
An ‘equal not a sequel' to 2019's Knives Out – the hit that effectively blew the dust off the whole all-star whodunnit genre – it marks the return of ‘the world's greatest detective', Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig). 
This time Blanc joins a murder mystery party on the private Greek island of a tech billionaire, Miles Bron (Edward Norton).
