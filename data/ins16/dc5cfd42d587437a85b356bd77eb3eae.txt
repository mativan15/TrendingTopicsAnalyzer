It feels like old times for AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC 6.62%). Folks crammed into multiplexes over the holiday weekend, taking in the long-overdue reboot of Paramount's (PARA 0.12%) Top Gun franchise. 
The premiere of Top Gun: Maverick went far better than expected, shattering box office records for the Memorial Day weekend. Shares of AMC would go on to surge on the news the moment that the market opened on Tuesday, only to give back most of those gains 20 minutes into the session. 
The strong debut is obviously welcome news for AMC and its smaller rivals.
