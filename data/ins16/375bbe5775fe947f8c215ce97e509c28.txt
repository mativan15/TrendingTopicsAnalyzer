When the Miami Dolphins placed the $10.9 million franchise tag on tight end Mike Gesicki this offseason, it was noted as a move that made sense.

With a new head coach and new offensive scheme coming in, it was unclear whether or not Gesicki could assimilate into the system and continue his stretch of productive play. The tag would give both sides a chance to see what their partnership would look like without being a long-term commitment.

Well, through six games this season, the former Nittany Lion has recorded just 15 receptions for 170 yards and three touchdowns while playing his lowest snap count (52%) since his rookie season.
