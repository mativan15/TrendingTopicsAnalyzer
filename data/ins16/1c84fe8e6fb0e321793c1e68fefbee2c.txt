The new Chancellor's mini-budget reversal, in which he undid much of the policies announced by his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng, risks seeing energy bills skyrocket to £5,000. Jeremy Hunt announced on Monday that the energy price guarantee, which caps energy bills for the typical household at £2,500 per year, is now set to be reviewed next April, a year earlier than Prime Minister Liz Truss and Mr Kwarteng had originally planned for. Under the original plans, typical households were not expected to pay more than the £2,500 cap, £1,000 less than industry regulator Ofgem's planned price cap would have cost families from October.
