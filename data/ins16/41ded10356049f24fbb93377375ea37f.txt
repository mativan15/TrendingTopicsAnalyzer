Thailand
retailer Big C Supercentre has acquired the Cambodian convenience store chain,
Kiwi Mart. Although the acquisition was finalised on 17
May, the value of the deal has not been made public yet. Kiwi Mart is a 24-hour
convenience-store chain that sells a variety of products from local and
international brands through 18 stores, 17 of them in the capital city, Phnom
Penh. Since 2019, Big C has operated two hypermarket stores in the country and
plans further expansion. Gary Hardy of Big C Supercentre described the
investment as an 'important opportunity' for both Big C and its parent firm,
Berli Jucker, to expand its business in Asean.
