By Reuters Published: 13:59 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 13:59 EDT, 21 October 2022 Oct 21 (Reuters) - Inter Milan coach Simone Inzaghi said on Friday that striker Romelu Lukaku is not quite match-fit to be a part of the squad to face Fiorentina in Serie A on Saturday. Lukaku was sidelined with a thigh injury in August and is close to returning but the trip to Florence comes too soon for the Belgium international. "Lukaku has been training partially with the group for two days, he clearly needs to regain match fitness but is very motivated," Inzaghi told Inter TV.
