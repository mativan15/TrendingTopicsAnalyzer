The Jets apparently can't have nice things.
Even when they're winning for the first time in forever, there's a banana peel in front of them on which to slip and fall.
Elijah Moore, the Jets 22-year-old second-year receiver, leaked news through his agent to the NFL Network on Thursday that he wants to be traded. Moore, who was said to be upset on Thursday, was sent home by head coach Robert Saleh before practice to calm down and spend time with his family, according to a source.
The Jets, according to the source, have no intention of trading Moore.
