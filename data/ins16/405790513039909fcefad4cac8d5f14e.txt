More money than sense?
A TikToker is dividing the internet after sharing the controversial money rules he followed in order to amass a fortune. 
Charlie Ehlers, a 28-year-old 'stock investor' from Australia, says he saved more than $200,000 by the time he turned 26 — thanks to ideas such as avoiding going to college unless you know what you want to do or buying a home unless it was for an investment.
'Here are some money rules I follow as someone in my 20s who has been investing for 10 years now,' Ehlers stated in the viral video, which has clocked up more than 675,000 views.
