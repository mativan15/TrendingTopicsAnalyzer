By Reuters Published: 01:29 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 01:29 EDT, 19 October 2022 By Nimesh Vora MUMBAI, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The Indian rupee was little changed to the U.S. currency on Wednesday, giving up a marginal rise at the open on persistent dollar demand from importers. The rupee was at 82.35 per dollar by 0510 GMT, barely unchanged from Tuesday. The local unit had opened a tad higher at 82.31 but dollar demand from importers nipped the uptick. The rupee's muted moves over the last few trading sessions have pushed over-the-counter, at-the-money volatility to one-month lows.
