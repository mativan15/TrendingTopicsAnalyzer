The anticipation made the setback that much worse. Following Harrisburg's 43-13 loss to Jefferson, a silence swept over the Tigers locker room. Coaches urged the players to be more serious. They knew it.

August 27 was the first opportunity for the Tigers to show that their theories about themselves were true. This could have been a rebuilding year for Harrisburg, losing one of the best quarterbacks in state history, a lot of contributors on a defense that pitched a shutout in the 2021 11AAA final and the entire offensive line of its undefeated state champions.
