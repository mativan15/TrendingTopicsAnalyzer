In a tight labor market, where competition for workers is fierce, companies are making a play to attract and retain employees by offering to pay their student loans. Take Inova Health Systems, which announced this spring that it would contribute $150 a month to pay down the education debt of employees who have been on the job less than three years, and $250 a month to those who have been there longer.

'We know that our team members have a lot of choices of where to work, where they want their career to go,' said Wendy Jolly, Inova's vice president for human resources.
