The Triangle is expected to be among the fastest-growing economies in the U.S. in 2022, driven by thriving tech and biotech sectors.

The region is projected to see economic growth of 3.4 percent this year, according to a new report from the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School. The report, titled 2022's Fastest-Growing Cities in the U.S., Ranked, was released Tuesday and examines the nation's 50 largest metropolitan areas and is part of the American Growth Project, a new Kenan Institute initiative that will provide a detailed look at localized economies.
