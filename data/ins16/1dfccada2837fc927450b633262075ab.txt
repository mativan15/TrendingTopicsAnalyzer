Dallas Cowboys' quarterback Dak Prescott hopes Sunday's 26-17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles was the last match he missed due to his injury. He initially planned to return with the game against the Los Angeles Rams, but his planned timeline was premature. Rams said maybe he was being eager. Cowboys' general manager and owner, Jerry Jones, suggested Cooper Rush as injured Prescott's backup and starting quarterback. Dallas Cowboys fans want Prescott to return. After great success in four consecutive matches, Cooper Rush's bubble burst in Philadelphia on Sunday.
