7:30 AM ETJoey Levy, the co-founder of micro-betting app Betr, doesn't believe the legal sports betting market that's taking shape in the U.S. is sustainable.Levy believes today's bookmakers are tailoring their products for experienced bettors and not the mass-market consumer. He says the long-term success of the betting market hinges on providing entertainment value."This isn't going to work over time if we're just trying to extract as much money from people as possible when they're betting on sports," says Levy, who co-founded Betr with celebrity boxer and social media influencer Jake Paul.
