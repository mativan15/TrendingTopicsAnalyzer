Last year, the energy firm launched its first electric blanket scheme to assist customers who are looking to save money during the cost of living crisis. Octopus Energy sent out 7,000 free electric blankets to customers who were most in need of them. According to the research carried out by the firm, the scheme saved customers 19 percent on energy costs compared to customers without electric blankets.Overall, an electric blanket would save the average household £300 at a time when energy bills are skyrocketing.
