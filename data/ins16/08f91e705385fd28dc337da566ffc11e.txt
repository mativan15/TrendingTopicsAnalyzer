With a variety of brands, styles and features to choose from, picking the right one may be daunting. Here's some expert advice for buying a hearing aid that works for you.

- Who are over-the-counter hearing aids for?

Over-the-counter hearing aids are only for adults with mild to moderate hearing loss. To ensure safety, the FDA rule has limited the peak sound output of over-the-counter hearing aids.

A good rule of thumb is that if you have the technical expertise to figure out an update to your phone's software settings, then you are tech savvy enough to manage a self-fitting hearing aid, according to Nicholas Reed, an audiologist and assistant professor in epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.
