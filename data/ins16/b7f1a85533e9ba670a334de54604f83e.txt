Few hours after the killing of popular Punjabi singer-turned-politician Sidhu Moosewala on Sunday, a Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar has taken the responsibility for the murder. The name of Lawrence Bishnoi has also come to the fore in the killing. Brar took to his social media account to claim the responsibility, writing that "he and Lawrence Bishnoi group was behind the murder". "Today, Moosewala was killed in Punjab, I, Sachin Bishnoi, Lawrence Bishnoi take the responsibility. It's our work. Moosewala's name surfaced in our brother Vikramjit Singh Middukhera and Gurlal Brar's murder, but the Punjab Police did not take any action against him.
