Sharp fluctuations in the EUR - GBP exchange rate have been triggered in recent times by major events such as Brexit, the war in Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis. This has prompted many people to move their money and transfer their euros to a UK bank account (or vice versa).
Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began in February 2022, the euro has struggled against a basket of major currencies. Against the pound, there have been some significant fluctuations as the conflict continues to apply major pressure to supply chains and soaring energy prices.
