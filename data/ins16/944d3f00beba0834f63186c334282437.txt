JacobH In late September, I wrote a piece about Denison Mines Corp. (NYSE:DNN) in which I gave the company a Buy rating. This was largely based on its sizable physical uranium holdings as well as the impressive amount of U3O8 reserves at its Wheeler River project. However, in the Risk section of the article, I noted that Wheeler River still contained a significant degree of risk. That's because Denison plans to use an in-situ recovery ("ISR") process instead of conventional mining methods at Wheeler, a process that is unproven in Canada.
