A former executive of OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace by trading volume, has been charged with committing wire fraud and money laundering during his time with the company in what the federal government called the 'first ever digital asset insider trading scheme.'Thirty-one-year-old Nathanial Chastian allegedly profited from his role of selecting which non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, would be promoted on OpenSea's homepage, according to the indictment released Wednesday from the Justice Department.
