Aishwarya Lekshmi, unlike many of her contemporaries, has a constant urge to pick scripts that matter. Courtesy that, she is truly becoming a force to reckon with. After bankrolling Sai Pallavi-starrer Gargi, unarguably one of the best films of the year, she chose to headline debutant Charukesh Sekar's Ammu – a chilling thriller about a domestic abuse survivor standing up for herself. Cut from the same cloth as films such Thappad and 47 Naatkal, Aishwarya's Ammu is a very familiar tale of domestic abuse of a helpless wife but thankfully it takes a very interesting detour to present a refreshing end.
