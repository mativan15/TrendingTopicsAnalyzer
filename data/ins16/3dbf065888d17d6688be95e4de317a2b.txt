It started with a little girl named Charlie, who was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of two. That's when Heather Lane and Charlie's father entered into the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of Canada's Team in Training campaign -- an annual endurance event to raise money to battle blood cancer. After almost 10 years of fundraising, Lane says she has seen the impact the donations have on people living with cancer and their families. 'Along the way, unfortunately, I have many, ‘Whys?' -- Charlie is one of them -- and I'm happy to say she is a thriving almost 12-year-old girl who I had the pleasure to reconnect with about three weeks ago at a fundraising campaign,' said Lane.
