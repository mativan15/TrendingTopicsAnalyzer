A police force has reminded people they should only phone 999 in an emergency after a man called to report he was waiting 30 minutes for pizza.

Essex Police issued the advice amid the busy Platinum Jubilee Bank Holiday weekend.

On Friday, their Force Control Room (FCR) received over 480 calls via 101, the phone number for reporting non-emergency crimes.

The force added a further 987 calls were made using 999, and they answered 93% of these in five seconds.
