Kroger Co. unveiled its "store of the future" on Oct. 20, testing the concept in Cincinnati.

Kroger, which is based in Cincinnati, launched the new store concept about a week ago but made it official with a ribbon-cutting ceremony Thursday morning.

The changes involve the way customers check out. The new concept gives customers a variety of options that include a group of Kroger's new high-tech modes of checkout as well as the traditional low-tech methods.

'We think it's going to be game-changing,' Kroger spokeswoman Erin Rolfes told MBJ sister paper, the Cincinnati Business Courier.
