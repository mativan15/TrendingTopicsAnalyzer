Perpetually troubled GM Korea has vowed to shift to profit as it marks its 20th anniversary. GM Korea CEO Roberto Rempel promised at an event celebrating the anniversary in Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province on Wednesday that Korean operations will turn into a "profitable and sustainable business" starting next year.GM Korea has an annual production capacity of 500,000 cars, but last year it produced only 220,000 at an operating rate of less than 50 percent as lucrative models were being built elsewhere, and the automaker's losses since 2014 have swelled to W3.
