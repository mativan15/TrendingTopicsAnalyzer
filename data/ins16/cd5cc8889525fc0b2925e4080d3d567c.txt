California's political watchdog is investigating a Milpitas official running for mayor after a resident accused her of falsifying information on campaign forms.

The Fair Political Practices Commission confirmed in a letter to Milpitas resident Christopher Martin that it has opened a case to look into the complaint against Vice Mayor Carmen Montano, which alleges she may have lied on a financial interest form about the purpose of a trip to China in April 2019.

The FPPC confirmation letter notes the agency has not yet "made any determination about the validity of the allegation(s)" made against Montano, or her culpability.
