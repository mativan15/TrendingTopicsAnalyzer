The Royal Family have access to some of the most incredible clothing in the world, but the royals have to adhere to a stricter style protocol than most. Duchess Meghan Markle is an avid trouser wearer, although this is something Queen Elizabeth II was rarely seen out wearing.Personal Stylist Melissa Lund previously told Express.co.uk that Queen Camilla "rarely wears trousers for public engagements".Whether this is because she doesn't think she suits them or she does not deem them to be "appropriate" enough is unknown.
