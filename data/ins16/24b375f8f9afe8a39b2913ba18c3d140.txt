Imagine if the housing market was covered in the news like the stock market:

'Split-level ranch homes from the 1970s in the Midwest fell today after a forecast for a colder than usual winter.'

'Mid-century 3-bedrooms in the Mid-Atlantic rallied as new Census Bureau data showed population growth.'

'Renovated bungalows were steady despite new import data that led to lumber and drywall prices falling.'

But, it doesn't work that way, does it?

More Americans own their homes, or at least co-own them with a lender, than own stocks.
