Jun. 4—On Friday, VFW District Commander Roger Cordle arrived at Widewaters in Lockport to pick up donations that were raised for the VFW on Memorial Day weekend. Cordle picked up the money in an empty ammunition crate to take back to the VFW post.

"The big thing for me is what we do for the veterans, like dinners and scholarships" he said. "The only way we can do that stuff is with donations."

Last weekend, Widewaters requested that volunteers come to the restaurant to help plant 2,448 American flags representing each US service member who was killed in the Afghan War.
