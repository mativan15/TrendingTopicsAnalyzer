The Canadian dollar CADUSD rose to its highest level in more than three weeks against its U.S. counterpart on Friday and was headed for its second straight weekly gain as recent volatility in global financial markets continued to subside.The loonie was trading 0.3% higher at 1.2730 to the greenback, or 78.55 U.S. cents, after touching its strongest since May 5 at 1.2729. For the week, the currency was on track to advance 0.8%.'The risk mood is clearly a big driver of the CAD's performance but firm commodities and modestly supportive (interest rate) spreads are perhaps adding to CAD tailwinds,' strategists at Scotiabank, including Shaun Osborne, said in a note.
