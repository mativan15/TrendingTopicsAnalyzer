Union Minister Nitin Gadkari has said it is difficult to make cycle tracks in the financial capital due to space constraints, which make it impossible to widen roads.Mr. Gadkari, who handles the road transport portfolio, underlined that it is important to encourage the sustainable and healthy habit of cycling.We can make dedicated tracks in tier-II and tier-III cities, he added."Actually, I am supporting your idea (of cycle tracks). But my practical problem is that in the city area, it is very difficult to increase the width of the road.
