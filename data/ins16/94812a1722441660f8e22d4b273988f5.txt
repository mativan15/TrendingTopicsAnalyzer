If Richard Corrigan asks you to join him for a bite to eat, you better turn up hungry, ravenous even. On the rainiest day of the year, the gardening team at the chef and restaurateur's Viriginia Park Lodge in Co Cavan is gathered around a communal table in a polytunnel where a peach tree and an apricot tree share space with a vintage soft-top Mercedes.The sports car is a little the worse for wear; Corrigan drove it over from London a while back, and somehow it stayed in situ. But the fruit trees are spectacular, heavy with fruit just waiting for summer warmth to ripen them.
