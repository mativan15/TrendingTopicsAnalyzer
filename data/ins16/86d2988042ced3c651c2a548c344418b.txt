David Quinn went to Montreal this summer to meet with Marc-Edouard Vlasic, part of the first-year Sharks coach's mini-tour of Eastern Canada to personally introduce himself to some of the team's veteran players.
Quinn's message for Vlasic was clear: The Sharks still need you.
'I said, ‘Listen, you're part of the solution here,' ' Quinn said last week. 'I don't know what's gone on before I got here, but you're a guy we're going to lean on. You're going to play against up lines, you're going to kill penalties.
