The rescue deal for McColl's by Morrisons will now be investigated by the competition watchdog (McColl's/PA) (PA Media)

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into the rescue deal to save high street convenience retailer McColl's by supermarket giant Morrisons.

It has confirmed that it has launched the inquiry by issuing an initial enforcement order addressing competition concerns in the UK retail sector.

This means that while the investigation is underway, Morrisons and McColl's must conduct business in a competitive manner, with no integration of the two businesses.
