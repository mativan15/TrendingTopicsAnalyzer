The WeWork location in Detroit opened shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020.

Coworking and office space operator WeWork is vacating one of its Detroit sites as it continues to face significant losses each financial quarter.

A WeWork representative confirmed Tuesday that the company's location at 6001 Cass Ave. in Midtown, where it leases 91,000 square feet, will permanently close by Nov. 10.

The closure will leave Detroit with two WeWork locations — both in downtown, at 1001 Woodward and 19 Clifford St.
