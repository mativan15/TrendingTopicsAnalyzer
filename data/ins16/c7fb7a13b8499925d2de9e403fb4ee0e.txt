A South Carolina-based food processor known for supplying U.S. military combat rations will build a facility in North Carolina, creating 440 jobs in a county with one of the state's highest jobless rates.

SO-PAK-CO Inc. and Gov. Roy Cooper announced on Tuesday the company's $85 million investment in a new processing and packing operation in Laurinburg.

The new positions, which include managers, operators and administrative personnel, will have an average salary of more than $45,000, which is above the countywide average in Scotland County of $40,894, according to a news release from Cooper's office.
