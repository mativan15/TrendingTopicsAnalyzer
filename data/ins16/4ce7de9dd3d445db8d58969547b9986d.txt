When I was 12 I got a job shelling peas at a local restaurant. In exchange for a few hours every weekend I was paid 50p and a can of Lilt. Does that qualify as my first paid job?
I also helped out on pig farms during the summer holidays. On one occasion, armed with an electric prodder, I was sent to entice a pretty savage boar out of a truck. I remember thinking: 'If I get out of this alive, I'm never doing it again.'
Have you ever struggled to pay the bills?
Yes, when I co-founded an alternative comedy club with two university pals above a pub in Dublin.
