Married At First Sight star Gemma Rose will not appear in the show's upcoming Christmas special due to her upset at the editing.
Although the final episode of this year's E4 series aired earlier this week, confirming which couples are still together and which couples have broken up, it has been revealed that some of the contestants will be back in December for another reunion.
Metro.co.uk previously reported that Matt Murray will not return for the special after a ‘traumatic' time on the programme.
