In what has been a frustrating year for the Oklahoma Sooners, left tackle Anton Harrsion has been a rock for Jeff Lebby's offense. OU's 700-yard performance against the Kansas Jayhawks did not go unnoticed by Pro Football Focus. The Sooners' left tackle made PFF's week seven Team of the Week.
Harrison didn't allow a single pressure on 51 pass-blocking snaps against Kansas. Throw in a 82.1 run block grade, and the big fella gets his name on PFF's Team of the Week.
