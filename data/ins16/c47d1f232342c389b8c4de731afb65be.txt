Viktoriia Hnatiuk/iStock via Getty Images A Quick Take On Boustead Wavefront Boustead Wavefront Inc. (BOUW) has filed to raise $15 million in an IPO of its Class A ordinary shares, according to an F-1 registration statement. The firm seeks to provide corporate finance and pre-IPO advisory services to companies in the Asia Pacific region. Given its business model change, licensing uncertainties and high IPO valuation expectations, I'm on Hold for the BOUW IPO at this time, although it may experience volatility in early trading due to its low nominal price.
