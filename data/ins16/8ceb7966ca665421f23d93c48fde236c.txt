Orlando Magic rookie Paolo Banchero on Tuesday called it a special opportunity to sign a multiyear endorsement contract with Jordan Brand ahead of the start of the regular season.
The apparel company officially announced the pact with Banchero on Monday after it was reported in late July that the two sides were nearing an agreement. He is the first known rookie this year to sign with an apparel company.
The No. 1 pick joins a star-studded roster of players signed to Jordan Brand, including Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic, Boston Celtics guard Jayson Tatum and New Orleans Pelicans forward Zion Williamson among others.
