'Zappe-mania' will be running wild for at least another week.

New England Patriots quarterback Mac Jones walked out onto the field at FirstEnergy Stadium on Sunday, ahead of the team's road game against the Cleveland Browns. But he never went through the normal warmups, which was an early indication that he wouldn't be ready to play.

Jones is still working his way back from the ankle injury he suffered in the Patriots' Week 3 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. So far, he appears to be ahead of schedule with what was diagnosed as a high ankle sprain.
