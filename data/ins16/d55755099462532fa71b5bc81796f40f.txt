A federal judge has dismissed South Carolina Congressman Ralph Norman as a defendant in a defamation lawsuit filed after Norman's Facebook comments related to a controversial 2021 arrest in Rock Hill.

Federal Judge Terry Wooten's ruling late Monday agreed with Norman's lawyers that the congressman acted in his official capacity when he made Facebook comments about Travis Price.

Price alleged defamation against Norman in the lawsuit.

The ruling comes three weeks before 5th District U.S. Rep. Norman, a Republican, faces a re-election.
