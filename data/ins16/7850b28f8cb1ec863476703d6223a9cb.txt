Liverpool have told Bournemouth and Nat Phillips' other suitors that they will have to pay £15million to sign the defender, according to a report.

The 25-year-old has enjoyed a rollercoaster journey at Anfield, but it looks like it will soon come to an end. He has spent the last six months on loan at Bournemouth following an incredible and unexpected Liverpool rise.

However, he does not have a long-term future with the Reds, who are willing to listen to offers for him.
