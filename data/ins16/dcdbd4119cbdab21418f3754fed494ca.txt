For some, it would be a dream car. 653 horsepower. Zero to 100 kilometers per hour in 3.9 seconds. All-electric, all-wheel drive with a range of 500-700 kilometers (310-434 miles) depending on battery capacity. Base price €69,900 ($68,200). It is the new top-of-the-line eT7 sedan from Chinese electric-vehicle manufacturer Nio (pictured above). The first ones are expected in Europe in October. Delivery of other models like the eL7 SUV will start in January. The company is taking orders for its smaller eT5, which is supposed to compete with Tesla's mid-range Model 3.
