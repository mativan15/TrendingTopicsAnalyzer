Most cinematic superhero runs tend to come in trilogies, which makes it somewhat of a mystery why we never got a third Kick-Ass film after the 2010 original and its 2013 sequel.

Kick-Ass 2 wasn't as well received as Kick-Ass, but the sequel still doubled its budget at the box office, and there's still surely an appetite among fans for more R-rated action from Aaron Taylor-Johnson's titular vigilante, the combustive Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) and company.
