Antonio Conte believes his Tottenham players were "scared" during their 2-0 defeat to Manchester United on Wednesday evening. The Red Devils won at Old Trafford thanks to second-half goals from Fred and Bruno Fernandes. The result has made a big impact on the Premier League table, as United are now just one point behind Chelsea in fourth after their goalless draw against Brentford. Tottenham, meanwhile, find themselves four points behind leaders Arsenal having played a game more. Conte's side are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with the Gunners and title favourites Manchester City, and they are also looking over their shoulders.
