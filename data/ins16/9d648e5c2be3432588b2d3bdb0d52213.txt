Dairy major Mother Dairy has announced a price increase owing to a rise in input costs, revising prices of full-cream milk to Rs 63 per litre and cow milk to Rs 55 per litre. Prices have been increased for Delhi-NCR and some other markets in north India. Mother Dairy is a leading milk supplier in the Delhi-NCR market and sells more than 30 lakh litres per day in poly packs and through vending machines. "The dairy industry has been experiencing a consistent surge in raw milk prices, which has increased by about Rs 3 per kg in the last two months alone, owing to multi-fold increase in varied input costs," Mother Dairy spokesperson said.
