Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has tweeted in praise of the recession facing the US in response to a follower's question, suggesting it's actually a 'good thing' because 'it has been raining money on fools for too long.' He blamed 'Covid-19 stay-at-home stuff' for 'tricking' people into thinking they could make money without having to 'work hard,' suggesting many people were in for a 'rude awakening.'Yes, but this is actually a good thing. It has been raining money on fools for too long. Some bankruptcies need to happen.
