As he heads home to his village of Shimlana in West UP's Saharanpur district on Sunday afternoon, Kartik Kumar's bags are noticeably heavy. He's carrying a years' worth of belongings. 'Diwali is coming up so I'm carrying presents for everyone at home. I'm also carrying all the medals I've won over the last year,' says the long distance runner who's based out of the Army Sports Institute in Pune.It's a rich haul particularly if one considers this is only the second full season of senior competition for the 22-year-old.
