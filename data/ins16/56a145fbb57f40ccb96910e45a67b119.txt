Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said drinking water supply in Delhi has increased from 930 million gallons a day (MGD) to 990 MGD in around a year. Delhi gets water from neighbouring states as per the allotment system made in the 1990s. That amount has not been increased since then. The capital's population was less than 1 crore in the 1990s; now it has increased to 2.5 crore, he said. "The water production in Delhi remained stagnant at 930 MGD for the last 25-30 years ... It brings me immense joy to say that our efforts have increased the water production to 990 MGD in a year or so," Kejriwal said after inspecting the Rohini sewage treatment plant and a lake being built there.
