Published: 15:05 EDT, 29 May 2022 | Updated: 15:05 EDT, 29 May 2022 Many Australians living with multiple sclerosis do not disclose their condition to their boss because they're worried they will be treated differently, a new survey says.

But an MS Australia survey released on Monday found 88 per cent of people who share their diagnosis have positive outcomes at work.
