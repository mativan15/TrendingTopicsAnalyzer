Tesla shares tumbled about 9% Friday on a report that CEO Elon Musk is considering laying off 10% of the company's workers, as well as new questions from U.S. regulators over complaints of the electric vehicles braking for no reason. 
In an email Thursday to Tesla executives titled 'pause all hiring worldwide," Musk wrote that he had a 'super bad feeling' about the economy and that the company needed to cut staff, Reuters reported.
Tesla had around 100,000 employees worldwide according to recent regulatory filings, including its subsidiaries.
