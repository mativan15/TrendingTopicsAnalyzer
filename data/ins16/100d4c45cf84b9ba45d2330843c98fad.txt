So-called MXN₮ tokens will initially be supported in the ethereum (ETH-USD), tron (TRX-USD) and ploygon (MATIC-USD) blockchains, Tether noted. Tether's (USDT-USD) expansion into Mexico prompts a "unique opportunity" thanks to multibillion-dollar flow of remittances into the country, as well as the difficulties involved with internal money transfers, Some "40% of Mexican companies are looking to adopt blockchain and cryptocurrencies in some form making Mexico a prime location for the next Latin American crypto hub," Tether said, citing data from crypto payments firm Triple A.
