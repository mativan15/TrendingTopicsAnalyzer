© UbisoftWhen this combination was first announced with Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle in 2017 I wasn't entirely convinced both Nintendo and Ubisoft hadn't lost their minds. I saw images of a Rabbid dressed like Peach, Mario and Luigi armed with guns and then was told it was a turn-based strategy game. Trust me when I say I was incredibly surprised to find that Kingdom Battle was actually good - really good in fact.So naturally, I was excited to get a chance to return to this wacky collaboration with Sparks of Hope, eager to see if the team had managed to further improve on the great base they had established.
