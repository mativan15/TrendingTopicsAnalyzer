Talk about electric vehicles (EVs), and not many investors see legacy automaker Ford Motor (F 2.10%) in the club just yet. You'd be stunned, however, to know how much Ford is investing in EVs and how rapidly they're selling out of them.
In fact, Ford's latest announcement reveals how big EVs could be to its growth in the coming years -- all while the company bucks the industry downturn even when it comes to traditional vehicles. It's a win-win situation for the company and a winner in the making for any investor who buys Ford stock now while it still trades cheaply.
