Kris Jenner said that she wants to divide her ashes among her children, turning her remains into necklaces after her death. On season two, episode five of Hulu's "The Kardashians," which aired Thursday, Kris and her daughters Kylie Jenner and Khloé Kardashian discussed their post-mortem plans while Kris was recovering from hip-replacement surgery. After Kris mentioned that her other daughter, Kim Kardashian, had asked her doctor to save her bones from surgery to turn into jewelry, Khloé brought up one of her mother's own wishes.
