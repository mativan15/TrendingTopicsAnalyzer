Sylvester Stallone and his wife Jennifer Flavin are keeping the dog they reportedly fell out over.
The actor, 76, and Jennifer, 54, split earlier this year, with his wife of 25 years announcing in August she had filed for divorce.
It was speculated at the time that part of the reason for their separation was Sylvester's new dog, rottweiler Dwight, though Sly denied this.
The action legend had reportedly got the dog against Jennifer's wishes, as she had worried they had too many pets already.
Sylvester later covered up a tattoo of Jennifer on his arm with a portrait of the dog, which – naturally – is said to have left his wife unhappy.
