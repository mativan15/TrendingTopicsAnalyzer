Mari Carmen Martinez/iStock via Getty Images With a market capitalization of just $2.32 billion as of this writing, TreeHouse Foods (NYSE:THS) is a fairly small player in the manufacturing and distribution of private label foods and beverages throughout North America. Over the past few years, the company has been on an interesting ride, with revenue falling but its bottom line improving significantly. Cash flows have been more consistent during this timeframe, but still have shown no real trend. After some significant changes to the company's operations, combined with having to pass on some of the inflation it is seeing to its customers, the picture for the company this year should finally be better on its top and bottom lines.
