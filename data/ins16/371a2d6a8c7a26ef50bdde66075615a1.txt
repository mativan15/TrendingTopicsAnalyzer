Climate activists from Just Stop Oil have made national headlines with a number of high-profile demos in recent weeks.

Last Friday, two members of the group vandalised a Van Gogh painting at London's National Gallery by throwing soup at the artwork.

On Friday, the two protesters threw cans of tomato soup over Van Gogh's famous Sunflowers painting, then glued themselves to the wall just next to the iconic image, before shouting: 'What is worth more, art or life?'

Over the weekend the group also organised a road block in Shoreditch High Street, blocked off Park Lane in London as they spray-painted an Aston Martin showroom, and on Monday morning scaled the Queen Elizabeth II bridge at the Dartford Crossing connecting Essex and Kent, leading to lengthy closures of the M25 motorway and delays of more than two hours for motorists.
