TomTom says it is laying off 10 percent of its global workforce due to advances in automation technology and greater use of digital techniques in its mapmaking process.
The planned cuts will equate to about 500 employees at the Netherlands-based geolocation tech specialist, which was hit hard by the pandemic and remains in recovery mode.
"Higher levels of automation and the integration of a variety of digital sources will result in fresher and richer maps, with wider coverage," said CEO Harold Goddijn.
