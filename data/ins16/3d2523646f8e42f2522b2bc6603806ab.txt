Fat Bottom Brewing Co. plans to bring Nashville back to Lower Broadway with its new restaurant and bar, Teddy's Tavern, opening at 104 Rep. John Lewis Way S. in March.

The Nashville-based brewer began conversations for the former Pancho & Lefty's Cantina space around fall of 2021, attracted to the space not only because of location, but because of the federal-style building's history, which dates back to the 1800s.

'We want to create a place downtown again where folks want to go, where you feel that old Nashville connection again,' said Josh Buckley, CEO of Fat Bottom Brewing.
