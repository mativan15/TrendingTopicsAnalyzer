More than five million British pensioners will be nearly £400 worse off this year, as their fixed retirement incomes fail to keep up with soaring inflation. 
Retirees holding a 'level annuity' will be among the hardest hit during the cost of living crisis. Their retirement incomes are fixed and they have no means of boosting their spending power while inflation hits double figures. 
An annuity converts a lump sum pension pot into a guaranteed income for life. There are more than six million people receiving annuity payouts, according to official figures.
