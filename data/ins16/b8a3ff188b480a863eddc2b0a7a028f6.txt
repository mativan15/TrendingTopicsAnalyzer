Funerals have begun in Uvalde, Texas, one week after a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school. Two 10-year-old victims were remembered today in the first of 11 services this week.

Meanwhile, state police said that a teacher had closed a door that the gunman ultimately used to get inside, but the door did not lock. We will return to this later in the program.

A special counsel's probe of the investigation into connections between Russia and the Trump campaign suffered a blow today in its first courtroom test.
