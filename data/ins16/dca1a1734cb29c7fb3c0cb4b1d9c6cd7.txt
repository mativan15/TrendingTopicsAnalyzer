Dustin Hoffman and Sissy Spacek are taking family bonding to the big screen.
 
On Thursday, Vertical Entertainment released the first trailer for Sam & Kate, in which Hoffman, 85, and Spacek, 72, play parents to each of their real-life children: Jake Hoffman (whom the actor shares with wife Lisa) and Schuyler Fisk (whom the actress shares with husband Jack Fisk).
 
The film meets Bill (Dustin) as his son Sam (Jake) returns to their "small town in the heart of the country" to care for his sick father, according to an official synopsis.
