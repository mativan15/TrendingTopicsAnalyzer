We're just over 12 weeks away from Week 0 of the college football season kicking off on August 27. While we still have almost an entire summer to get through before our Saturdays return to being filled with college football, BetMGM has already posted their season win totals and conference odds for the upcoming season.

Right off the bat, you'll notice that the highest projected win total for any team this season is just 10.5 wins. This is in stark contrast to last season, where Alabama, Ohio State, Clemson and Oklahoma all had win totals listed at 11 or higher.
