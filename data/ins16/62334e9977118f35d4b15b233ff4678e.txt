On saving a penalty after assisting Mohamed Salah on the weekend...Not bad at all! I'm really happy about that because we work so hard every day to come here and perform. Sometimes things don't happen just as we want but I think in the last few games it's working out.On analysing his penalty save... I won't tell too much about that! But I think it was a good save. In football everybody studies everybody – the strikers study the goalkeeper, the goalkeepers study the strikers or the penalty takers.
