Stating that 166 'criminals' were killed and 4,453 more injured in police action in the last five years, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said the 'result' of his government's 'zero tolerance against crime and criminals has ensured that no criminal is free in the state as they are either in prison or have been killed.'
