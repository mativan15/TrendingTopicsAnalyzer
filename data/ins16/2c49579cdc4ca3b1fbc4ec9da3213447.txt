PHILADELPHIA -- This year's Braves team seemed better than the one that won last year's World Series. But this talented group will now forever be remembered as just another of those great clubs that fell short of expectations.   The Braves' dream to win a second straight World Series evaporated as they were eliminated from the postseason with an 8-3 loss to the Phillies in Game 4 of the National League Division Series on Saturday afternoon at Citizens Bank Park. There was a lot to remember about this season, but thoughts are currently focused on the many forgettable things that transpired over the past few days.
