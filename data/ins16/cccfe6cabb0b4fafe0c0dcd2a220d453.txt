Published: 19:01 EDT, 31 May 2022 | Updated: 19:08 EDT, 31 May 2022 As we head into a sunny bank holiday weekend, be sure to check the expiry date of your sun cream.Over one million Brits are slathering on sunblock from a bottle over a decade old - despite the fact that most only remain effective for between six months and two years.A study, conducted by King Edward VII's Hospital in London, found that sunbathers have a rather cavalier attitude towards sun protection in general.In a survey of over 2,000 adults, nine per cent admitted to only wearing sun cream when on holiday abroad, while five per cent wrongly believe they don't need to wear sun protection at all.
