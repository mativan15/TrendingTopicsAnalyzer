Florida NewsBy Wendi GrossmanOct 14, 2022Thanks to Hurricane Ian, a slow start is expected for the stone crab season which officially gets underway Saturday. Howie Grimm with Grimm's Stone Crab in Everglades City says he's not sure exactly how traps will look. He says prices will go up because there will be production problems in the gulf with so many boats along the Southwest coast demolished and out of commission. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has filed an Executive Order waiving the commercial trap tag requirements in Southwest Florida for the remainder of the license year to help trappers get back to business as soon as possible.
