The story of Connor Heyward thriving at the tight end position continues. After nearly leaving the Michigan State program after getting passed in the depth chart at running back, Connor Heyward made a switch to tight end, and it's one that might have earned him a long future in the NFL after he was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers this spring.

On Sunday, Heyward had his first big highlight for the Steelers, when he caught a pass from Kenny Pickett that he was able to turn into a huge 45-yard gain.
