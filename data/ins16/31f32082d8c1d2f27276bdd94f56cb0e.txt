"All you need is love," wrote John Lennon and Paul McCartney.And Wall Street is buying into this thematic stock play.Shellshocked investors who were sitting on fat returns last year have seen much — if not all — of their winnings go up in smoke in 2022. It's a different market now, investors are facing "recession" headlines, and they want to know what to buy. Typically, stocks that hold up well when the economy heads south are names like Walmart (WMT) and General Mills (GIS).But you can add Bumble (BMBL) and Match (MTCH) to that list as well, says Brent Thill, equity analyst at Jefferies.
