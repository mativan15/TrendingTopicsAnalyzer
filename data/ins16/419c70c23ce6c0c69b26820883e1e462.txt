Over 80 officials and industry leaders have signed an open letter in support of bringing ARPA-H to Massachusetts, the latest step in the campaign to bring the billion-dollar agency to the Bay State.

The letter was released Thursday by the Coalition for Health Advances & Research in Massachusetts, or CHARM, which has been leading the charge to bring the agency to the commonwealth.

'Massachusetts has the density of resources necessary for ARPA-H to thrive— talent, leading research universities, teaching hospitals, and life sciences companies,' the letter read.
