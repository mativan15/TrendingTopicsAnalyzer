Rishi Sunak says he remains a 'fiscal conservative' despite unhappiness within the Conservative party about the £15bn cost of living package he announced on Thursday to help people manage rising fuel bills.The chancellor did not rule out further emergency relief next year as he conducted a round of broadcast interviews to discuss the measures.The package of relief was more ambitious than predicted but Sunak was quick to insist he had not changed his politics.'First and foremost I'm a fiscal conservative; I believe it's incredibly important that I manage the country's finances responsibly,' he said on Friday morning.
