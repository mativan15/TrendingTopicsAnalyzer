I have stepped in as manager for a small-mid size IT MSP that is doing about 1.5 million a year in revenue. The existing manager/senior engineer had just stepped out suddenly and the company desperately needed the gap filled. As we were friends I stepped in and quit the cyber security career track I was on.

I have never been one to negotiate well on behalf of my own wage, seeing each step as a means to an end but I have reached a point in my career where I am not sure on the next step.

For context I am a seasoned senior tech, with a couple of advanced penetration testing certificates (OSCP&OSEP).
