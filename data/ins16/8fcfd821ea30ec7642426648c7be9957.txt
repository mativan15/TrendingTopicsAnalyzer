A development site in the Edgewater neighborhood of Miami sold for $16.5 million.

Miami Beach-based 3350 Biscayne LLC, an affiliate of DLC Capital Management led by technology entrepreneur David Centner, sold the 37,000-square-foot site at 234 to 272 N.E. 34th St. to Tulip Development Group, led by Amit Kort in Sunny Isles Beach. Valley National Bank provided a $9.75 million mortgage to the buyer.

The property last traded for $11.5 million in 2018, so it gained in value. That's a reflection of the huge gain in rents in Edgewater in recent years as more people move to Miami.
