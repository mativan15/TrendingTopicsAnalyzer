Nearly 30 years after members of Stoney Point First Nation began an occupation of Camp Ipperwash, only about 50 people remain living at the former Military Training Centre in Lambton County. CTV News was invited inside the gates of the camp Saturday as some of those residents launched a new book titled ‘Our Long Struggle for Home.' The book tells personal stories of the decades-long battle of broken promises by the government and their fight to reclaim their homeland before and after the Ipperwash Crisis in 1995.
