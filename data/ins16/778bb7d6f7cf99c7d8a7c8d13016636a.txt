Half the teams in the Women's College World Series, which begins Thursday in Oklahoma City, have a softball player from the Houston area on their roster. Texas, which opens the double-elimination tournament against UCLA at 11 a.m., has a lineup that is about half-Houston.The Longhorns' top two hitters - Janae Jefferson and Mia Scott - sit atop the batting order and both used to terrorize opponents at high school softball fields all around Houston. Jefferson has made her mark as one of the best offensive players in University of Texas' history, and Scott is making her mark as just a freshman.
