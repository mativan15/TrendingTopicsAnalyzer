PHILADELPHIA — Aidan Sayin threw for three touchdowns and 299 yards and Pennsylvania was never threatened in a 34-14 win over Columbia on Saturday. The Quakers (5-0, 2-0 Ivy League) have won their first five games for the first time since their historic 2003 team went 10-0 and earned a 13th league title.

The Quakers defense got Penn its first touchdown when 285-pound defensive tackle Micah Morris intercepted Joe Green at Columbia's 27 and rambled his way into the end zone for a 10-0 lead to close the first quarter.
