Employees at an Apple store in Oklahoma City voted to unionize, the second store at the technology company to do so.

The Communications Workers of America (CWA), which the union will join, announced the result in a tweet on Friday.

CNN reported that the initial tally from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) was 56 votes in favor to 32 opposed, or about 64 percent voting to support unionizing.

A store in Towson, Md., became the first to unionize following a vote in June.

The Hill has reached out to the NLRB, CWA and Apple for comment.
