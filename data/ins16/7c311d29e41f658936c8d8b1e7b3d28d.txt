Gaithersburg's Novavax Inc. (NASDAQ: NVAX) just got the regulatory go-ahead to make its Covid-19 vaccine available to adults as a booster.

The company said Wednesday that the Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization to administer its vaccine as a first booster dose at least six months after a person received a primary immunization series by any of the existing Covid vaccines. The decision comes about two months after Novavax sought the agency's authorization.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must recommend Novavax's shot as a booster, an action that typically happens quickly after an FDA decision.
