Recently rival fans signed a petition to remove Manchester City's Erling Haaland on claims of him being a robot, and the petition has over 400,000 signatures. 'Erling Haaland is a serious problem. He shows up out of the blue, and consistently ruins the weekends of the hardworking people of this great nation. This issue must be dealt with in order to protect the mental health of millions in our society,' the petition reads.'To put it shortly, if things don't change, it will only get worse. This guy is nine league goals away from equaling last season's golden boot winner.
