Boston will soon pick up food-only waste curbside, along with trash and recycling, for residents interested in composting their food scraps.
Food waste accounts for one-third of Boston's waste stream, according to Boston chief of streets Jascha Franklin-Hodge, and it's the country's largest single landfill material according to the FDA. When food waste rots in landfills instead of being composted, it produces methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gases. 
But when food waste is separated from trash, it reduces the load of landfills (which are filling up in the region), and is turned into either compost or an electric power supply.
