The helicopter pilot will be joining the 14 waves of planes and helicopters on display in the skies over London to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. Flt Lt Hobkirk said the planning for the display had been going on for months and will conclude with a performance from the Red Arrows six minutes exactly after the start of the flypast. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said: "The first aircraft is over the top at 1300, or one o'clock local, which is a Royal Wildcat."About a minute after that, or exactly a minute after that.
