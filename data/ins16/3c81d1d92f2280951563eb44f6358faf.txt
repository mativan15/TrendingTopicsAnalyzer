May 30—UConn repeats as Big East champs

By Journal Inquirer Staff

MASON, Ohio — The UConn baseball team is returning to Connecticut with a second straight Big East Tournament championship in tow.

Bryan Padilla went 2-for-3 with a two-run home run and three RBIs and Matt Donlan added a two-run single to lead the Huskies to a 7-2 victory over Xavier in the first game of the tournament championship series Sunday at Prasco Park.

As it turned out, there was no reason to worry about the UConn baseball team's mastery of the Big East.
