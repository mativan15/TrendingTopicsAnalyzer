WORLD champion men's doubles pair Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik continued their smooth progress at the Denmark Open on Thursday (20 October), when they reached the quarter-finals by beating French duo Lucas Corvee and Ronan Labar 21-13, 21-18 in 31 minutes.

The Malaysian duo - who ended Malaysia's long wait for world champions at the Badminton World Championships in Tokyo in August - trailed for only two points in their last-16 matchup at the Jyske Bank Arena in Odense.
