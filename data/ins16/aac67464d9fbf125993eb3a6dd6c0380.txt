CLEVELAND — With their season on the line, the Yankees totally shook up their lineup on Sunday, benching the mistake-prone Isiah Kiner-Falefa, replacing him at shortstop with Oswaldo Cabrera and inserting Aaron Hicks into the lineup in left field.
It came a day after Kiner-Falefa made three more defensive miscues in the Game 3 loss to the Guardians.
Isiah Kiner-Falefa fields Jose Ramirez's infield single which loaded the bases in the ninth inning of the Yankees' 6-5 loss to the Guardians on Oct. 15, 2022.
