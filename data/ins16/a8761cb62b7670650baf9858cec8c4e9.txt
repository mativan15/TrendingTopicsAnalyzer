Online mattress retailer Eve Sleep has called in the administrators after a 'heartbreaking' decision to call off the potential sale of the business.The CEO of the company, Cheryl Calverley, said Eve had 'moved heaven and earth' to keep the business afloat, but the 'scale of Eve was simply insufficient to withstand the economic tsunami that has gathered momentum over the past six months'.Since June, the company that has been battered by the general downturn in online home furnishing sale, as the cost of living crisis has caused consumers to retreat from all but essential purchases, has been carrying out a strategic review to examine the 'financing options' of the business.
