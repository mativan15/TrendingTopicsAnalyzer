Perhaps no company is more emblematic of the pandemic's impact on the stock market than Zoom Video Communications (ZM -2.69%). After going public in April of 2019, Zoom ended that year up only 9.7%, compared to the S&P 500's 12.8% return over that same time frame. However, 2020 told a different story. With the pandemic forcing all of our interactions online, Zoom became a household name and the stock ended 2020 up 444% from its initial public offering. Since then, Zoom's stock is down 67% and is now trading around where it was at the beginning of the pandemic.
