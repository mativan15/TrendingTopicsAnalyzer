Investing.com – Gold was up on Monday morning in Asia, firming in volatile trading. A weaker dollar gave the yellow metal a boost, but a move towards riskier assets in Asia capped gains.

Gold futures gained 0.41% to $1,858.85 by 12:47 AM ET (4:47 AM GMT).

'With the three-day holiday in the U.S., which means lower liquidity than usual, and a lack of top-tier data until Wednesday, we may find that gold will remain nailed to its tight range around $1,850 unless a new catalyst arrives,' City Index senior market analyst Matt Simpson told Reuters.
