LIBRA (Sept 24-Oct 23) The beginning of the day is likely to bring mixed results for you. Those of you working in the government sector will get beneficial results, but those working in the private sector may have to work harder. At times, you will find yourself in a dilemma, and may not be able to take decisions. The financial front, however, may remain bright all day. Relations with your spouse will be good and both of you will support each other. Family life may throw up an unpleasant surprise and lead to disputes.
