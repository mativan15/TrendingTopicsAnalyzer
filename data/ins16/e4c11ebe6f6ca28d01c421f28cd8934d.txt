The Indianapolis 500 is always a huge deal as one of the biggest races in the world and on the single greatest motor sports day in the world.
Sunday, in addition to the Indy 500 (12:30 p.m. ET, NBC), there's also Formula 1's Monaco Grand Prix and NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600. So race car drivers around the world have been super busy lately, but many in racing still found time to wish Jimmie Johnson good luck for his big day.
Johnson — a seven-time NASCAR champ turned IndyCar driver — will make his Indy 500 debut Sunday, living out a childhood dream of his.
