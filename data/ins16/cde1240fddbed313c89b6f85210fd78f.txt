Hamilton youths – along with counterparts from Auckland – make up most of an 80-strong cohort involved in ram raids across the country, says the Police Association president. Chris Cahill was commenting on calls for Hamilton to be given a decent slice of a new $6 million fund to cut the risk of 'repeat victimisation to small retailers'. That cash would go towards security and prevention equipment, such as bollards, alarms and fog cannons. It comes as Hamilton's mayor said she was ‘underwhelmed' by the government response to requests for more help.
