Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin declined to comment on a report of a heated locker room exchange between quarterback Mitch Trubisky and wideout Diontae Johnson during their Week 5 matchup against the New York Jets.But Tomlin did say it would be a "good" thing if it did happen because "it probably means there's a couple guys that wanted to win." Tomlin was asked Tuesday to confirm a report from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that alleged Trubisky was benched at halftime for rookie Kenny Pickett after Trubisky and Johnson got into a heated argument over the passing game.
