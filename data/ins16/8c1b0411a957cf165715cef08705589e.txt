Back at Easton Monday morning, Scollins posted a bogey-free round of 3-under-par 68 to capture the individual title by two shots and help Xaverian (295) repeat as South champion over Wellesley (297) and Hingham (298).'I'm really excited I won individuals but I'm also happy the team got the win,' said Scollins. 'I liked the course yesterday and I felt like I could go low.'Scollins became the second straight Xaverian golfer to take home the South title after Joey Lenane won in 2021 at Acushnet River Valley Golf Course.
