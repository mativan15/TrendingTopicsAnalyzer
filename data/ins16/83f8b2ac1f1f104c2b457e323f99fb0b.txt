The jury soon will go to a room to deliberate on Friday afternoon in the double murder trial held in the Somerset County Common Pleas Court.

On Thursday evening, Judge Scott Bittner listened to the defense attorneys' motions to dismiss the charges against their clients arguing that the government failed to prove its case against them. He only granted partial dismissal of charges against one of the defendants, Deandre Callender. The homicide, aggravated assault and unlawful restrain charges were dismissed.
