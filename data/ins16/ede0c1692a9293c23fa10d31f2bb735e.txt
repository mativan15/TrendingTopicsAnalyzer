Amprius Technologies (NYSE:AMPX) notifies that the company received the first large-scale anode production machine from centrotherm, which it plans to install at its current Fremont location. The machine is expected to increase Amprius' capacity for silicon anode production to approximately 2 MWhs, or ten times its current capacity, by year-end 2023. The expanded silicon nanowire anode production capacity is expected to accelerate Amprius' development of its technological processes for building batteries at a gigawatt-hour scale.
