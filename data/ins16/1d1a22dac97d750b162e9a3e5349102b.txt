The Canadian government's baby steps toward addressing the climate crisis are "embarrassing," famed environmentalist David Suzuki said Monday while expanding on the profanity-laden criticism he launched during a federal announcement last week. "We are the only one of the G7 nations that hasn't reduced our greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels," Suzuki told CTV News Channel's Power Play. "We haven't even capped our emissions. We're 20 per cent above our 1990 levels, and we're saying that we're leaders? How could we possibly be leaders with that kind of a record?" Suzuki was waiting for a seaplane in downtown Vancouver on Friday when he happened upon a news conference with Tourism Minister Randy Boissonnault, who at one point remarked on the scenic waterfront view of the region's North Shore Mountains.
