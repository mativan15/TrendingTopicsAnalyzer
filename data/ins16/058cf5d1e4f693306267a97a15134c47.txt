Summer Spellman (Harriet Bibby) was shocked to discover that she was pregnant in Coronation Street this week, and in tonight's episode she made a decision on what to do.
Her secret didn't remain that way for very long, as she and Aaron (James Craven) joined Billy (Daniel Brocklebank) and his friends Esther (Vanessa Hehir) and Mike (Tom Lorcan) for lunch in the pub.
While Esther complained about the amount of celery in her hot pot (how dare she?), Summer left her sandwich almost untouched, sparking concern among the adults.
