Premier Inc. (NASDAQ: PINC) awarded CEO Mike Alkire a total compensation package of almost $7.9 million for fiscal year 2022, which ended June 30.

That is a 37% increase over his total compensation in fiscal year 2021. But Alkire was CEO for only two months of that fiscal year. He succeeded Susan Devore on May 1, 2021. In his first full year as CEO, his total compensation was about $1 million less than Devore's $8.9 million in 2021.

Premier calculates that Alkire's compensation is about 71 times the $111,125 median annual compensation for its 2,600 employees.
