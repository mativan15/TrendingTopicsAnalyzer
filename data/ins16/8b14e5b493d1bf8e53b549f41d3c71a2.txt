A Facebook sperm donor fathered 15 children but never told the mothers he has an inheritable condition that causes learning disabilities.
James MacDougall, 37, fathered children to lesbian women through private donations advertised on social media despite knowing he had Fragile X syndrome, a genetic disease that leads to low IQ and developmental delay, and cannot be cured.
MacDougall's identity came out in a family court battle in Derby, UK after he applied for parental responsibility and child arrangement orders for four of his children — even though he originally signed an agreement saying he didn't want contact with some of his children.
