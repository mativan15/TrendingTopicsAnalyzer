Farmers quit their fields and hit the streets of New Zealand's cities Thursday in countrywide protests against plans to tax greenhouse emissions from farm animals.Convoys of tractors, 4x4s and farmyard vehicles disrupted traffic in Wellington, Auckland and other major hubs, as protestors demanded the centre-left government ditch plans for an animal "burp and fart" tax.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern touted a "world first" levy on emissions of methane and nitrous oxide produced by the nation's six million cows and 26 million sheep as a step to tackling climate change.
