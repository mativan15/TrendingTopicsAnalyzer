Published: 20:35 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 01:05 EDT, 31 May 2022 Victorian GPs and pharmacies will have enough vaccines to meet surging demand as a free jab program begins to combat a "nasty" influenza season, health authorities say. From Wednesday to June 30, Victorians aged six months and over can get a free flu shot at one of more than 3000 GPs and community pharmacies under the $33 million program. "This is our first real flu season for two years," Health Minister Martin Foley said on Tuesday.
