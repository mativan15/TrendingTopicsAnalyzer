Louis Tomlinson has revealed that he only expected One Direction to be on a break ‘for a year or two' before getting back together.
The boyband, who scored four UK number one singles between 2011 and 2015, announced a hiatus in 2016 so that the boys could pursue other projects.
Since then, each of the members, also including Liam Payne, Niall Horan and Zayn Malik – who left in 2015 – have gone on to have solo success, with Harry Styles arguably the most successful of the group so far.
Louis, whose new album Faith in the Future releases next month, joined One Direction during their appearance on talent show The X Factor.
