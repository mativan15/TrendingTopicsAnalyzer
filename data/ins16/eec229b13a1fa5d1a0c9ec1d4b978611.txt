A former federal member of parliament is now vying to be Winnipeg's next mayor. Robert-Falcon Ouellette, a 27-year veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), said of all his work experiences it's his time in his military that prepared him most for the position of mayor. He noted that during his time in the Canadian Armed Forces he watched some really great leaders, as well as some 'terrible' ones. 'I took an intermediate leadership program at the Royal Military College and an advanced leadership program as well at the RMC,' Ouellette said in an interview with CTV News Winnipeg.
