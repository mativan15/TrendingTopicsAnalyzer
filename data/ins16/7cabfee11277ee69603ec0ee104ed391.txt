All Blacks star Ardie Savea is set to take a sabbatical in 2024 to play overseas. Savea is heading to Japan to play for the Kobelco Kobe Steelers, before returning to New Zealand in June. Savea, who has played 67 tests, remains contracted with New Zealand Rugby until the end of the 2025 season. He re-committed to the Hurricanes and NZR late last year, where a sabbatical was part of his contract extension. Under NZR Board policy, Savea will be immediately eligible to be selected by the All Blacks on his return in 2024 – an arrangement made for other long-serving All Blacks such as Beauden Barrett, Brodie Retallick and Samuel Whitelock in recent years.
