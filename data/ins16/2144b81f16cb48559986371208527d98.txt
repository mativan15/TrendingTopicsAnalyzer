The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has launched an aggressive Muslim-outreach campaign ahead of the forthcoming urban polls in Uttar Pradesh. Back-to-back functions featuring top ministers of Yogi government 2.0 are lined up till Tuesday. Amid the buzz that the party could field Muslim candidates, mostly in western U.P, in these urban elections, the BJP has been tactically aiming to win over the most backward among the Muslims, ones who do odd jobs for survival and have been among the beneficiaries of the various schemes of the 'double engine' BJP governments at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh.
