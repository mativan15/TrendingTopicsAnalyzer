ReutersRenault's Chief Executive Luca De Meo The relationship between Japan's Nissan Motor Co and top shareholder Renault SA should be "more equal", the Nikkei newspaper quoted the French automaker's chief executive as saying. "This is not one side losing and the other side winning," the newspaper quoted Luca de Meo as saying in an interview, which took place in France on Monday. "Each company needs to do what is best," he told the Nikkei, adding that that was the spirit of their alliance. Renault is Nissan's largest shareholder with 43% while the Japanese automaker owns 15% in its partner.
