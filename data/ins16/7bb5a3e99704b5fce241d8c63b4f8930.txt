The company is a $10.5 billion market cap stock in the Energy Sector (XLE) which primarily operates in the key Marcellus shale region. SWN is actually a holding company that engages in the exploration and production of natural gas, oil, and natural gas liquids, according to The Wall Street Journal. Its E&P segment is complemented by a marketing segment, which also benefits from big current crack spreads.
