2319 GMT--Macquarie is pulling ahead of major Australian banks on new home loans, says UBS analyst John Storey in a research note. In analysis of regulator data for April, UBS says that Macquarie has maintained its leading position in new mortgage business, continuing to write more than all the majors despite only having a 4.5% share of the market. The investment bank notes that needing to fund higher loan growth, Macquarie is taking share in household deposits. While home loan pricing competition continues, all majors except ANZ grew owner-occupier mortgages in the month.
