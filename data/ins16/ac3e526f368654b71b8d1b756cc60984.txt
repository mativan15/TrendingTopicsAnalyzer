NEW YORK - Stocks closed lower Tuesday and the market eked out a tiny gain for May, a fitting end to a tumultuous month as worries about a possible recession, inflation and rising interest rates bruised Wall Street. The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, having recouped about half of its loss from earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7%, while the Nasdaq composite slid 0.4%. Both also pared some of their losses after falling at least 1.4%. Such swings should perhaps be no surprise given Wall Street's action this month, amid some of the wildest trading since the early days of the pandemic.
