In the second half of May 2022, video game maker Electronic Arts (EA -0.35%) rallied from less than $112 per share to eclipse $138 per share. The company, known to gamers and sports fans as EA Sports, recently reported double-digit growth in annual net bookings and its player network.
EA's $135 to $140 price point isn't too intimidating -- especially compared to high-priced stocks like AutoZone and Chipotle Mexican Grill. Those two positions trade above $2,000 and $1,360, respectively. Still, if you're just starting your investing journey, you might not want to drop this week's entire investment budget on a single stock -- no matter how much you love playing FIFA 22.
