Rumored for weeks, resumption for the Indiana-Kentucky series took a substantial step forward Wednesday.

Kentucky coach John Calipari confirmed at SEC media day in Birmingham, Alabama the two schools have agreed 'in principle' to restart their annual regular-season series during the 2025-26 season. Multiple outlets present at SEC media days reported Calipari's comments.

Final details still need to be worked out, with locations and timeframes to be determined. But the baseline agreement to resume one of college basketball's most-storied rivalries is an important step — perhaps the most important step — toward getting Indiana-Kentucky back on the annual schedule.
