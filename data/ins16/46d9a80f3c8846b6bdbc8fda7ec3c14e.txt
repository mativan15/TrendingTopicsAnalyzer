U.S. stocks kicked off the trading week on Monday with a rally after Britain reversed course on an economic plan, while Bank of America was the latest financial company to post solid quarterly results, which lifted optimism about the corporate earnings season. Britain named Jeremy Hunt finance minister, and he immediately dispelled many of Prime Minister Liz Truss' fiscal measures, which had unnerved markets in recent weeks. Bank of America Corp shares surged 6.06% as the lender's net interest income was buoyed by rising interest rates in the quarter, even though it added $378 million to its loan-loss reserves to buttress against a softening economy.
