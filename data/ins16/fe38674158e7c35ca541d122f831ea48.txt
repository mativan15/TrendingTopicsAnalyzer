Pakistan-based anti-India terror groups Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) have established 11 training camps in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover last August, a UN Security Council-mandated monitoring team has revealed, adding that JeM runs eight camps, of which three are under direct Taliban control. Those familiar with the details told ET that JeM and LeT have drawn specific mention in report like this after a gap of at least over five years. Both groups appear to have concentrated their camps in the Nangarhar and Kunar provinces, which border Pakistan.
