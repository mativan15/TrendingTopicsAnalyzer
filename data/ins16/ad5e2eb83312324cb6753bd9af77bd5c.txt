(Bloomberg) -- Europe's nations agreed to take emergency measures to ease the liquidity strain in energy markets as billions of euros are tied up to secure trades and company debt soars ahead of a potentially volatile winter.European Union leaders will hammer out steps to improve market functioning in a bid to boost transparency, alleviate 'liquidity stress' and curb price swings, according to the conclusions of a meeting Thursday. While details are still to be agreed, the move indicates progress toward stabilizing the EU market after several countries took matters into their own hands with large utility bailouts.
