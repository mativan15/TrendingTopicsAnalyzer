The caste system in India does not paint a rosy picture, so why expect those at its receiving end to do so? The artworks at Vaanam — the ongoing Dalit art, literature and theatre festival — question the idea of identity and existentialism through art and aesthetics. In bold strokes, intense colours, and various shapes, the perspectives of nearly 22 artists stand expressed as paintings and sculptures at the Varija and Kadambari galleries of DakshinaChitra Heritage Museum. Co-organised by Neelam Cultural Centre, an initiative of filmmaker Pa Ranjith, the exhibition aims to 'grapple with the disturbing reality of caste discrimination'.
