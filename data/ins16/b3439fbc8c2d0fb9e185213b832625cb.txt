Earlier this week, the Supreme Court refused to accord an urgent hearing to a plea against an order banning storage, sale, and use of all types of firecrackers in the national capital till January 1, 2023. On October 10, the apex court had refused to stay the Delhi government's order banning storage, sale, and use of all varieties of firecrackers till January 1 to check pollution levels in the national capital, saying it did not want to add to the air pollution. Meanwhile, some states have allowed the use of 'green crackers' on Diwali.
