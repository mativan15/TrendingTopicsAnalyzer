Pfizer's plan to sell its Covid vaccine for up to $130 a dose once the US government stops buying the shots has been labelled 'obscene'. The pharma giant announced on Thursday that it would charge between $110 and $130 per shot once the government phases out its free distribution programme, which could happen as early as next year.Pfizer said in a statement to the Associated Press that it expects Americans with private health insurance or Medicare would still get the vaccines for free.However, advocates for free global vaccine distribution have accused the drugmaker of price gouging just as positive case rates begin to surge ahead of an expected winter spike in cases.
