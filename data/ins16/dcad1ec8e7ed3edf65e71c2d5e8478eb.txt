Published: 08:14 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 08:24 EDT, 16 October 2022 Health leaders have warned the new chancellor that making 'difficult decisions' for NHS funding 'risks having major consequences for patient care'. Jeremy Hunt has insisted fresh 'efficiency savings' will need to be made to address the country's economic issues, but declined to get into specifics about potential new cuts or what promises could be axed in a bid to save money. On his third day in the job Mr Hunt, who is a former health secretary, said he was 'not taking anything off the table'.
