It's a wrap on getting expensive blowouts and buying various hair tools. 
Why? Because the coveted and hard-to-come-by Dyson Airwrap is back and better than ever, in a newly designed 2.0 version. 
The new Dyson Airwrap multi-styler hair tool hits shelves today, June 2, and may soon be out of stock if you don't act fast, like the original Airwrap that has been sold out a number of times at almost every retailer we could find.
