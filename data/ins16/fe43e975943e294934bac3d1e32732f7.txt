The Tuft & Needle Guest Ready Sale has just been extended, which means you have a little longer to save up to 15% on select mattresses (opens in new tab), as well as furniture and bedding. It's an ideal opportunity to get your guest room all kitted out ahead of the holiday season. There are discounts on the T&N Original Mattress, a budget-friendly memory foam mattress that's designed to contour to your body and offer pressure relief without trapping heat, as well as the Mint Mattress (designed to offer superior cooling powers for warm sleepers), and, for the best of both worlds and for a firmer sleeping surface, the Tuft & Needle Hybrid Mattress.
