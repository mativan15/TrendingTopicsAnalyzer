By Chris Wack Aeglea BioTherapeutics Inc. shares fell 32% to $1.02 after the company said it received a refusal to file letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding its biologics license application for pegzilarginase for the treatment of Arginase 1 Deficiency. The stock hit its 52-week low of 82 cents a share earlier in the session. The company said the FDA requested additional data to support effectiveness, such as evidence showing that plasma arginine and metabolite reduction predicts clinical benefit in patients with ARG1-D or clinical data demonstrating a treatment effect on clinically meaningful outcomes.
