NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The National Football League (NFL) announced its first-ever "Black Friday" game will stream on Amazon Prime Video next year, building on the relationship between the league and the streaming giant.

The NFL already has a stranglehold on Thanksgiving broadcasts, with its annual lineup of Thursday games as common as turkey on the table in households across the United States for the annual American holiday.

It is now staking its claim on the unofficial annual "Black Friday" shopping promotion, when bargain-seekers hunt for holiday deals at big-box stores and online.
