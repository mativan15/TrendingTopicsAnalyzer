With all of the attention focused on football, it's hard to believe the men's basketball season is right around the corner. Oregon has its first game in exactly three weeks and when the Ducks take the court on Nov. 7 to take on Florida A&M, they'll be ranked No. 21, according to the first Associated Press poll that was released today.
UCLA is the top-ranked Pac-12 team as the No. 8 team in the country and Arizona is ranked No. 17. Whether it's a coincidence or not, Michigan and its coach Juwan Howard, said last week they don't owe Oregon a return game from 2019, is ranked just below the Ducks at No.
