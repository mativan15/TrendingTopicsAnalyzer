hapabapa Commercial-stage biotech Vanda Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VNDA) announced Friday that the FDA issued Orphan Drug Designation for VPO-227, an experimental therapy for cholera. Despite the low incidence of cholera in the U.S., the infection is a global concern that leads to an estimated 1.4 – 4M cases and 21K – 143K deaths annually. VPO-227 is designed to block a cellular component called Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR). CFTR can lead to cholera-induced intestinal fluid loss when it is affected by the cholera toxin.
