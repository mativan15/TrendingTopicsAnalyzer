The Seahawks now have six of their nine 2022 draft picks under contract after signing first-rounder Charles Cross. The signing was reported Wednesday morning by the NFL Network.

Signings of draft picks are somewhat formalities since the length of deals and overall amounts are all predetermined based on where a player is selected, as laid out in the league's collective bargaining agreement with players.

Cross, a left tackle from Mississippi State taken ninth overall, gets a standard four-year deal worth a fully guaranteed $21.
