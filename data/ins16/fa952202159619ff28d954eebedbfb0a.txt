Early in his administration, an astute Trump friend was quietly urging him to support a single-payer insurance system, like Medicare For All, to replace Obamacare. It is too bad that he didn't take up his friend's proposal.

In 2017, I wrote a column suggesting that Trump could score politically by backing such a program. Conservatives in Taiwan in the 1990s had reversed their hostility to single-payer and profited politically, stealing a major issue from the liberals' platform. The same thing could have happened here.
