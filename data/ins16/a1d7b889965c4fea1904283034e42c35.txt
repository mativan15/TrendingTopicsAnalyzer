TPG is counting cows using 5G. That's it, that's the news. But it's actually pretty big news, at least in the agritech space. Counting cattle is, so I've herd (sorry), quite a laborious task. And results from a now-completed 5G smart-farming trial at Tamworth could change this. According to TPG, its 5G play could 'revolutionise livestock exchanges of the future', by 'automating the labour-intensive practice of counting cattle, with the potential to save farmers time, money and increase productivity'.
