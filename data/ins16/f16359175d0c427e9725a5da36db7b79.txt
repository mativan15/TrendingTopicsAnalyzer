If you want to know who really controls BT Group plc (LON:BT.A), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. I quite like to see at least a little bit of insider ownership. As Charlie Munger said 'Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.

BT Group has a market capitalization of UK£19b, so it's too big to fly under the radar. We'd expect to see both institutions and retail investors owning a portion of the company.
