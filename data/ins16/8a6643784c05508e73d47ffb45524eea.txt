Sjo Thesis Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is down 6.25% (after-hours trading reference) after the company reported slightly worse-than-expected Q3 results. But I am not convinced that the move is reasonable or sustainable. Firstly, investors should consider that Q3 delivery numbers - which were presented a few weeks earlier - indicated already a challenging environment. And the respective headwinds have arguably been priced in, given that the stock is down by about 20% since the news. Accordingly, the stock price reaction following Q3 seems more like a mechanical response to headlines, than to changes in fundamental value.
