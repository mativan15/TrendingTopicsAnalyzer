Paul Cully is a Stuff sports reporter OPINION: There will be lots of talk in the coming days of how the New Zealand Rugby-Silver Lake deal isn't a silver bullet to solve the game's many challenges. Silver bullet no, but silver bazooka yes. This deal is about money – it's always been about money – and more precisely it's about the need to blast cash into New Zealand rugby's system from top to bottom and all the crevices in between. It's about keeping All Blacks in the country - as players boss Rob Nichol explicitly told Stuff in February – and it's also about making sure women have showers and toilets at rugby clubs up and down the country.
