Shares of the WeChat operator fell as much as 5.3% in Hong Kong trading Thursday, setting it on a path to close around HK$235 per share -- its lowest point since early 2017.

The drop comes as Chinese stocks have declined across the board this week, weighed by concern about their earnings outlook after China delayed the release of key economic indicators and reiterated its commitment to a harsh Covid Zero policy at its twice-a-decade Communist Party congress.
