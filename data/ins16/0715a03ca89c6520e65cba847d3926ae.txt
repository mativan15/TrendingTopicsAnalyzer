OTTAWA - Canada's auditor general has found the federal government has made limited progress to identify and address barriers to putting a process known as gender-based analysis plus into action. Gender-based analysis plus is used to take stock of inequalities and specifically how gender and other aspects of one's identity can affect how well a person is able to access programs and services. Capital Dispatch: Stay up to date on the latest news from Parliament Hill Auditor general Karen Hogan said the Privy Council Office, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat and Women and Gender Equality Canada have taken some action to identify and address barriers to implementing gender-based analysis plus since the last audit in 2015, but they need to do more.
