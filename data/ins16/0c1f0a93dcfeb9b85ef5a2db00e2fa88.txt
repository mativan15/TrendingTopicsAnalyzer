Tesla CEO Elon Musk reportedly has a message directed at employees who have been working from home since the pandemic: Show up to the office or lose your job.
In an email sent to company executives May 31 with the subject line 'Remote work is no longer acceptble (sic)' Musk wrote, 'Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla,' according transportation news site Electrek.
