The Rams announced a handful of roster moves on Tuesday, including the latest shakeup to their offensive line.

Left tackle Joe Noteboom was placed on injured reserve after tearing his Achilles in last Sunday's win over the Panthers. He joins fellow offensive linemen Tremayne Anchrum, Logan Bruss, David Edwards, and Coleman Shelton on that list. The Rams have also been without center Brian Allen due to injury, but he is not on injured reserve and is expected back in the lineup at some point.
