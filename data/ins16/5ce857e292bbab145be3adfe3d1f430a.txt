A no man's, deserted belt located in a restricted military area, which displays a board saying ‘trespassers will be prosecuted' has been chosen as the site to put up sculptures made from scrap, costing taxpayers a whopping Rs 1.5 crore. Ironically, the civic body says that 'huge tourist footfall' is the reason for choosing the site in question.
According to the details, scrap would be used to make sculptures in the stretch of green belt across thirteen government houses in Sector 31, which falls in an area where the general public is not allowed.
