GUEST: Alex Edmans, professor of finance at the London Business School

Welcome to Season Two of 'Responsible Investing for a Sustainable Economy!'

The guest to kick off our sophomore season is Dr. Alex Edmans, professor of finance at the London Business School, noted TED speaker and author of ' Grow the Pie: How Great Companies Deliver Both Purpose and Profit.'
