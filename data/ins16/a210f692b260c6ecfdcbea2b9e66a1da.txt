Increasing inflationary pressures and supply chain bottlenecks remain a cause of concern for the manufacturing sector, which saw a contraction of 0.2% on an annual basis in May. GDP data showed that India's economy grew by a modest 4.1% in Q4FY22, down from 5.4% in the previous quarter. Indian economy's pace of recovery slowed down owing to global supply bottlenecks caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and higher input costs.

While the overall industrial activity in the fourth quarter registered a growth, the manufacturing sector remained the sole laggard.
