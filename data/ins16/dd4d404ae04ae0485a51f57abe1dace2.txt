'Hometown hero' is a widely used term that has no singular definition.

Often firefighters, police officers and athletes are the most frequently referenced — generally with one courageous act or standout moment solidifying their spot in local lore.

Another group of people that receive recognition is military members, who are often categorized in this group for awarded, unique heroics rather than typical service.

However, this isn't the case during State College Area High School football games.

Following the first quarter of every home contest at Memorial Field this season, the school and onlooking fans have taken a moment to recognize and applaud an active duty military member or veteran.
