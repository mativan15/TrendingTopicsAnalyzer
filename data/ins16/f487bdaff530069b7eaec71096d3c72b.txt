Former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney told a Senate committee Thursday that Canada is likely headed for a recession amid 'difficult economic times,' but backed the Liberal government's current 'fiscal discipline' in tackling high inflation.
'I think a recession is most likely globally and probable in Canada,' he said, citing slowdowns in the U.K., Europe and China.
While the United States' economy has some 'momentum,' Carney said a recession will probably be required south of the border to get inflation fully under control and Canada's close ties to the U.
