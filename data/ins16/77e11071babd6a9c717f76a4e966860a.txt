Founded in 2020, Memphis-based Redwood Services is a relatively new company. But its youth hasn't made it hesitant to pull the trigger on deals.

MBJ last reported on the home services firm — which invests in residential HVAC, plumbing, and electrical services companies — in early June, after it invested in Indianapolis-based Service Plus Heating, Cooling, and Plumbing.

Since then, it's made two more platform investments. On June 8, just a week after announcing its work with Service Plus, it revealed it had invested in Arizona-based Plumbing & A/C Medic, according to a press release.
