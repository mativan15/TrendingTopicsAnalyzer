The Arizona Cardinals receiving corps will look very different in Week 7's matchup with the New Orleans Saints. Marquise 'Hollywood' Brown will likely miss the game thanks to a foot injury that could cost him the rest of the season. His targets could be split between two players making their 2022 Arizona debuts: DeAndre Hopkins and Robbie Anderson.
Hopkins' return from a six-game PED suspension was expected. Anderson's arrival was not. The Panthers shipped their former 1,000-yard wideout west Monday after sending him to the locker room in the middle of the team's 24-10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.
