Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has attacked 'grotesque chaos' surrounding Liz Truss after the sacking of Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor.

Giving a speech in Barnsley after a day of upheaval in Westminster, Sir Keir said the damage caused by last month's mini-Budget was "unprecedented" as he repeated calls for a general election.

He pointed to the "grotesque chaos of a Tory prime minister handing out redundancy notices to her own chancellor" as he accused Ms Truss of putting 'party first and country second'.
