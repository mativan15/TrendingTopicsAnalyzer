Variety - TV News Anthony Zuiker and Sinclair Broadcast Group have struck an unusual deal that calls for the 'CSI' creator to work with the station group giant on crafting original content, some drawn from Sinclair's wealth of local news archives.The plan is to sell shows in syndication to other stations as well as to assemble docu series pulled from the archives of its 185 TV stations that can be licensed to outside buyers. Zuiker will also consult with Sinclair's news directors and journalists on amping up the storytelling qualities of local news reports, particularly on big national stories.
