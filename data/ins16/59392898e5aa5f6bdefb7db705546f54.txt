Next year marks the 50th anniversary of my graduation from MIT with a bachelor's degree in pure mathematics. As an entering freshman I had dreams of doing important work such as proving The Four Color Theorem (first posed in 1852 and finally solved in 1976) and Fermat's Last Theorem (first posed in the late 1630s and finally proved 350 years later). Alas, when I turned 19 and realized I had not proven any significant theorem, I decided it was time for another line of work. I got a Ph.D. in sociology at Harvard and have had a career as a business school academic.
