Ashwa executive director Bharath BommaiAshwa Energy, a Dharwad-based manufacturer of earth-mover parts, has entered into a collaboration with Miller UK Ltd to build IP-led products for the global market. Miller UK manufactures a range of products like quick coupler, buckets, and special attachments for construction, mining and quarrying industries worldwide. The company has developed quick coupler which reduces the time of replacing buckets as different tasks require different types of buckets. 'We are also exploring opportunities to export to other European countries, South America and Africa,' Ashwa executive director Bharath Bommai (33) said.
