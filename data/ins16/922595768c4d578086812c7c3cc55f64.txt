Apple has been forced to cancel plans to use Chinese memory chips for its iPhones after US President Joe Biden hit Beijing with fresh technology sanctions.

The White House placed new restrictions on China's semiconductor sector designed to block its access to advanced graphics and memory processors.

US officials also added memory chip maker Yangtze Memory Technologies to a blacklist, called the unverified list, which lumps new licensing requirements on any American company wishing to trade with it.
