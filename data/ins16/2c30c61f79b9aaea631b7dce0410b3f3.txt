Juan Jose Napuri/iStock via Getty Images The Q1 Earnings Season for the Silver Miners Index (SIL) has finally ended, and one of the first companies to report was Endeavour Silver (NYSE:EXK). From a headline standpoint, the company had a solid quarter, reporting 4% higher production and a significant increase in revenue (+68% year-over-year). However, the latter was driven by inventory drawdown, and while sales were up, margins fell off a cliff to just $2.58/oz. The silver lining is that some of this negativity looks priced into the stock, and further weakness below US$3.
