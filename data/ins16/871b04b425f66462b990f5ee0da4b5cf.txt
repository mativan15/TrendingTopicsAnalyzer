A customer pays using his WeChat app at a market in Beijing in August 2020. THOMAS PETER / REUTERS Xiaoli, 32, spends an average of three hours a day on WeChat. The young woman (her first name has been changed) uses the application to communicate with her family, friends and colleagues and to send documents at work. She spends time looking at posts on the app's equivalent of Facebook's wall, where users share photos, videos, articles and thoughts. She also uses it when she goes shopping or eats out, presenting a QR code to be scanned at checkout.
