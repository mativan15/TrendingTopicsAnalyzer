NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - Michael Avenatti, the brash California lawyer who once took on then-President Donald Trump, is scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday for defrauding his best-known former client, the porn actress Stormy Daniels.

A federal jury in Manhattan convicted Avenatti in February of wire fraud and aggravated identity after a two week trial, agreeing that he embezzled nearly $300,000 in book proceeds intended for Daniels.

Prosecutors recommended that Avenatti, 51, receive a prison term that was "substantial" but shorter than the approximately five or six years -- including a mandatory two-year term for identity theft -- recommended under federal guidelines.
