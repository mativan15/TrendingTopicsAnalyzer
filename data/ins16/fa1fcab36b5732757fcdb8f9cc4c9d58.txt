Katie Piper has defended Meghan Markle, saying that she finds the scrutiny levelled at The Duchess of Sussex ‘toxic'.
Speaking on Loose Women today, Katie went in to bat for Meghan after the former Suits actress opened up about how she felt ‘objectified' while working as a ‘suitcase girl' on Deal or No Deal.
‘Anytime Meghan says anything she's scrutinised in a way a lot of women aren't and I find that quite toxic, that treatment of her,' Piper said as the panel discussed the comments Meghan made on her Spotify podcast.
