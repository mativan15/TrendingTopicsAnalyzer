Conor McGregor has claimed he would defeat Floyd Mayweather in a boxing bout if the two rivals returned to the ring for a rematch. The UFC icon fell to the American via TKO in the 10th round in their 2017 contest in Las Vegas, which was dubbed ‘The Money Fight'. The Irish star has reportedly set his sights on a rematch with Mayweather though, and took to social media to reveal his confidence in victory should the fight go ahead. After Claressa Shields tagged Mayweather in a tweet comparing the two fighters and their styles, McGregor intervened.
