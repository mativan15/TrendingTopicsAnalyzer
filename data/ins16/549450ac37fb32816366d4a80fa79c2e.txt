A New York appeals court on Thursday affirmed the conviction of Harvey Weinstein for rape and sexual assault, turning down his bid to overturn the decision based on arguments that the trial was stacked against him.
In a unanimous decision, a five justice appellate panel of the New York Supreme Court backed the trial judge's rulings that Weinstein claimed were procedurally improper and unfair. 'We reject defendant's arguments, and affirm the conviction in all respects,' reads the 45-page order.
Weinstein was convicted in February 2020 on two of five charges of committing a criminal sexual act in the first degree and third-degree rape.
