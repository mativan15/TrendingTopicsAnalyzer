May 29—TUPELO — Elliot Johnston, co-owner of Hempsters in Tupelo, said he got into the hemp business because he enjoys helping people with pain relief.

People from all walks of life, he said, step through the door of his shop, which sells hemp-based products that contain less than 3% THC.

"I get doctors, teachers and a lot of people over 50 that come in here all the time," he said. "Most are looking for some form of (pain) relief or looking to relax."

Johnston is eager to jump into the medical cannabis business for the same reason.
