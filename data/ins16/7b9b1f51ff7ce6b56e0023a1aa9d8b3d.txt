It's been a whirlwind few years for Wrexham after being taken over by Hollywood superstars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. The two have now owned the football club for nearly two years now as they would come so close to promotion last season, losing to Grimsby Town in the semi-finals of the play-offs whilst also losing in the FA Trophy Final against Bromley. The two owners are well liked in Wrexham, and have been to a number of games whilst spending time in the small city. This past year, a documentary was released on their journey entitled 'Welcome to Wrexham' - which has since been rebooted for a second season.
