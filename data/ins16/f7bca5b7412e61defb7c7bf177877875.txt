For more than a decade, Kurt Kraiger, Ph.D., had worked at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. But the professor desired a change; he wanted to live in a bigger city, and one where he could have more of an impact on the community. So, about four years ago, Kraiger took a position at the University of Memphis — and quickly fell in love with the Bluff City.

Now, he's channeling that affection into a new project, which could bring significantly more funding to local Black tech businesses.

'This is something I was really excited to jump on board with, because I love my city,' said Kraiger, chair of the Department of Management and associate dean for academic programs and research in the Fogelman College of Business and Economics.
