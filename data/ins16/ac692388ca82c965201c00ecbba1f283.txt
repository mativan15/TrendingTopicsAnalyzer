'We're trusting our story to someone else, and that means it will go through their lens,' she said.
Reflecting on the entertainment industry, in which she started her career before meeting Prince Harry, she said the scandals of 'Me Too' and the diversity row at the Oscars had brought a name to 'certain things that were accepted'.
Before that, she said, 'if there was any discomfort, you just dealt with it'.
The Duchess did not specify whether she had been personally subjected to any untoward behaviour, but said the culture 'forced a lot of women to live with this idea of staying silent, not being disruptive, not giving voice to the things that might create concern or discomfort'.
