The moon and you make such a creative team this week, and ideas move smoothly from private to public.  
And with the new positive money direction of Mercury, you're making, and keeping, smart cash decisions.  
Your passionate side may have felt restrained recently, but as 'F' comes closer, you can feel so free.  Lucky numbers add up to your age.

DESTINY DAYS: You're one to watch at work on Wednesday, and take charge so well.
