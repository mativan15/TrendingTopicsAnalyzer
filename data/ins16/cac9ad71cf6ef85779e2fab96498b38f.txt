The Indianapolis Colts (3-2-1) have endured a roller coaster season thus far but appear to be trending in the right direction following their 34-27 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars (2-4) at Lucas Oil Stadium.

Their first divisional win of the season was long overdue, and now they travel to Nashville for another pivotal matchup against the Tennessee Titan (3-2), who are coming off their bye week.

For the majority of power rankings, the Colts moved up after their win over the Jaguars. Most publications have them ranked in the high-teens and low twenties.
