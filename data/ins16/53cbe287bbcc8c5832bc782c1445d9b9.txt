The rupee slipped 19 paise to 82.38 against the US dollar in early trade on Monday as persistent foreign funds outflows and weak domestic equities weighed on investor sentiments. At the interbank foreign exchange, the domestic unit opened lower at 82.33 against the dollar, then lost further ground to quote at 82.38, registering a fall of 19 paise over its previous close. In initial deals, the rupee was moving in a close range of 82.38-82.33 against the American currency. In the previous session on Friday, the rupee had settled at 82.
