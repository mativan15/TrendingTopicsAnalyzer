EMMA CHOI, HOST: 
 Hey, everyone. I'm Emma Choi, and welcome to EVERYONE & THEIR MOM, a weekly show from Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! This week we're talking about graduation with Wait Wait panelist, comedian and someone whose fan base should really call themselves the Kondabooboos (ph) - it's Hari Kondabolu. Hi, Hari.
(APPLAUSE)
HARI KONDABOLU: Hey, how are you, Emma?
CHOI: Hari, it's graduation season, right? So it's the beautiful time of year where you get to find out how many of your high school bullies are going to nursing school.
