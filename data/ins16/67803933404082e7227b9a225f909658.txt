afif c. kusuma/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Grab Holdings (NASDAQ:GRAB) shares are rising 2.9% in Tuesday premarket trading after Bernstein analyst Venugopal Garre upgraded the stock to Outperform from Market Perform on improving momentum in its ride-hailing segment. The expected rebound in ride-hailing should help to offset a moderation in food delivery. The upgrade also reflects potential long-term value from fintech and grocery segments, he said. "Ride-hailing will benefit from the reopening, and the scale-up can be non-linear as demand for mobility normalizes and costs reduce with an increase in driver supply," Garre wrote in a note to clients.
