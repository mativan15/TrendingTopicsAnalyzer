Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's campaign to bus illegal immigrants deeper into the country remains popular among his state's voters — and that includes Hispanic voters.

A new University of Texas/Texas Politics Project Poll revealed Friday that support for the idea remained strong in the state despite fierce criticism from immigrant-rights advocates, the Biden administration and the Democrat-led cities and states where migrants are being dropped off.

Overall, voters backed Mr. Abbott's busing by a 54% to 35% margin, with 38% saying they 'strongly' supported the idea.
