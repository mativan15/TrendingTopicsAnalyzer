A former Twitter engineer has a novel idea for Elon Musk to test how many fake users are on the site: secretly create his own army of bots. 
Musk, who's currently locked into a $44 billion agreement to buy Twitter, has suggested that as many as 20% of Twitter accounts are fake or spam — four times as many bots as Twitter claims. The Tesla CEO has said his takeover is 'on hold' as he awaits proof from Twitter that 'spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users.'
Twitter has insisted in regulatory filings it has strong spam detection systems, that the 5% figure is accurate and it plans to go through with the deal.
