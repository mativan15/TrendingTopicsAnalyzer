New York Yankees head coach Aaron Boone has blamed the stadium's roof being opened in Houston for their loss to the Astros on Thursday night. The Yankees have now fallen to a 2-0 against the Astros, who need two wins to advance to the World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies or San Diego Padres. In what has been described by Yankees fans as 'the worst excuse of all-time', coach Boone stated that the stadium had played a part in their loss. Aaron Judge connected with a pitch in the eight innings which looked like it could be heading into the stands for a home run, but it landed short, with the Yankees down one score heading into the final innings where they would go on to suffer the crushing defeat.
