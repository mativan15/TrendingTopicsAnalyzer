The Maharashtra government on Thursday decided to fill up vacancies for 75,000 posts which fall outside the purview of the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC), an official release said here. A cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde also decided to set up a Niti Aayog-like body to advise the state government, the CMO statement said. TCS and IBPS will conduct examinations for recruitment of 75,000 class-B, class-C and class-D non-gazetted employees, the cabinet decided. In another decision, the cabinet approved a proposal to set up the 'Maharashtra Institution for Transformation' on the lines of the Niti Aayog to provide guidance to the state government on policy.
