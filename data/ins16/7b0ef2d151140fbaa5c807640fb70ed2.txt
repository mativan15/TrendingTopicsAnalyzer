'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' star Lupita Nyong'o says she supports Marvel's decision not to recast the titular superhero after star Chadwick Boseman died unexpectedly.

But she's not revealing if she's the new Black Panther.

The '12 Years a Slave' Oscar winner, who plays the Wakandan War Dog Nakia in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, shared her take in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter published Wednesday, lending her voice to a raging debate about the franchise.

'Losing your centerpiece, everything changed,' Nyong'o said of Boseman, who died of colon cancer in 2020 when the sequel was still in its early stages.
