A day after the Tennessee Titans scooped up rookie safety Josh Thompson from the Jacksonville Jaguars' practice squad, the Jaguars replaced him on the roster with former Arizona Cardinals safety Deionte Thompson.
Deionte Thompson, 25, was the Cardinals' fifth-round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft and started six games in his first two seasons while contributing most on special teams. After making Arizona's 53-man roster again this season, Thompson was waived by the team near the end of September.

In three games this season, Thompson played only six defensive snaps and 49 on special teams.
