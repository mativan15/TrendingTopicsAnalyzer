Frogman1484 It's been a little over 4 ½ months since I bought back into Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AAWW) in an article with the painfully unoriginal title "Buying Back into Atlas Air Worldwide", and in that time, the shares have risen about 40% against a loss of about 10% for the S&P 500. My regulars know what time it is. It's time to brag. You obviously came here for that, but you may also be interested to know whether it makes sense to buy more of this stock at current prices, hold, or sell and take profits.
