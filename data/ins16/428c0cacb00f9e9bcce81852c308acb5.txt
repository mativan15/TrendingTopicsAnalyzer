The return of international travel has meant a steady improvement in business and group bookings at InterContinental Hotels Group.Keith Barr, chief executive of the owner of the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza chains, said that although third-quarter leisure revenues were 12 per cent ahead of 2019 levels, business and group bookings were still not back to pre-pandemic levels, although the gap was closing.He said business and group travel had been building in each quarter in the year and he expected groups to turn positive on 2019.
