May 28—Wittenberg University's Department of Music is accepting applications to the Bayley Summer Music Experience.

This program, made possible through a gift from Ruth Kunkel Bayley, provides summer enrichment for music students in grades three and up, according to the university.

Participants will have a weeklong series of musical opportunities taught by professional music instructors to allow them to gain experience in music fundamentals through activities and reading workshops, as well as "courtyard specials" to spotlight local musicians who want to share their talents and stories with the participants.
