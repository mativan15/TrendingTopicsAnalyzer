Asos, the one-time poster child for the shift to online fashion retailing, will overhaul its business model after the economic crunch and a string of operational problems hammered its profits.New chief executive José Antonio Ramos Calamonte said that while Asos's core business in the United Kingdom remained strong, returns from its international operations, particularly from the United States, were unsatisfactory and needed to be addressed.He vowed to re-vamp Asos's 'inefficient' supply chain, find a way to re-engage its 20-something customers, better leverage its data, cut costs and refresh its culture.
