In all the excitement about partygate yesterday, an important announcement went almost unnoticed. It was that Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, would 'call in' for review, under the new National Security and Investment Act, the proposed sale of Newport Wafer Fab to Nexperia, a Chinese company. Newport is one of the UK's few remaining manufacturers of semiconductors – of which there is a huge shortage at the moment – and a key part of the related manufacturing cluster in South Wales.
Stephen Lovegrove, the National Security Adviser, apparently concluded in March that there was no reason to block this deal.
