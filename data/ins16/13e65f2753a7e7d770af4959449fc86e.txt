Apple's annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) 2022 takes place next Monday, June 6. One of the most important aspects of the developer conference is the new software updates Apple announces for its key products during the opening keynote. This year, the tech giant is expected to officially announce iOS 16 and iPadOS, along with updates for macOS and watchOS.
Leaks indicate Apple's iOS 16 will see a major improvement over previous versions in the features department. But visually, it will be similar to iOS 15.
