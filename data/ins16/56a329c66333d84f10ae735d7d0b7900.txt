Trump spoke at the event alongside several other high-profile Republicans, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem — whose remarks the president applauded respectively — despite widespread criticism of the event after an 18-year-old gunman opened fire on teachers and pupils with an AR-15 semiautomatic assault rifle, devastating the community just under 300 miles away from the convention.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott had been slated to speak in person, but opted instead to address the conference virtually Friday with pre-recorded remarks as he held a press conference in Uvalde at the same time.
