Nikola founder Trevor Milton on Friday was convicted by a jury of fraud in a case alleging he lied to investors about the electric vehicle company's technology.
The jury found Milton guilty on one count of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud after deliberating for around five hours. Milton was acquitted on an additional count of securities fraud.
During the trial in federal court in Manhattan, prosecutors depicted Milton, 40, as a 'con man' who sought to deceive investors about the electric- and hydrogen-powered truck maker's technology starting in November 2019.
