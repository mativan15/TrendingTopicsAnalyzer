Sparks flew during the MC General House meeting here on Friday after an AAP councillor used the word 'cartoon' for a former BJP mayor.Amid the meeting's proceedings, AAP councillor Jasbir Singh alleged that people's water connections had been snapped in Faida village as a punishment because the BJP candidate, a 'cartoon', had lost the election from there.Opposing the words used by Jasbir, the BJP councillors demanded an unconditional apology from him.Also raising objections against Jasbir's language, SAD councillor Hardeep Singh said such derogatory words should not be used in the House against a former mayor.
