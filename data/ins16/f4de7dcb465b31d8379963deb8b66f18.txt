Liz Truss has resigned as Prime Minister, firing the starting gun on another Conservative leadership election. 
In her resignation statement outside Number 10, Ms Truss said the leadership election will take a week.
According to odds given by bookies, Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt are the most likely contenders to take over.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt ruled himself out as a contender shortly after Ms Truss resigned.





 
 


Ms Truss's resignation follows a short and chaotic stint in Number 10, precipitated by her disastrous mini-Budget, in which unfunded tax cuts spooked markets.
