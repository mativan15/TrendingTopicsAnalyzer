Both Confluence and SharePoint offer strong organization applications for your company's information. Each has its benefits and both offer similar pricing opportunities. Confluence offers a free forever plan with limited features while you can only test SharePoint for 30 days through your free cloud trial for Microsoft's bundles. If you use other Microsoft 365 products, SharePoint is included in most of these bundles, with rates as low as $6 monthly per user.
SharePoint has more immediate customer support options available, with both phone and web support being accessible 24/7, no matter what your need might be.
