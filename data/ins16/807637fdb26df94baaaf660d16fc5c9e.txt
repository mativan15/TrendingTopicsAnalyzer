One of the men charged after a fatal beach fight along Lake Michigan has been charged with setting a fire at a Lake Forest business earlier this month.

Nicholas Caban, 20, of Highland Park, was ordered held in lieu of $1 million bail on the arson charge, and a Lake County judge doubled Caban's bail to $200,000 on a weapons charge that was filed against Caban during the investigation into the death of Matthew Ascaridis.

Ascaridis, 45, died Sept. 17 of injuries he received in a beachfront altercation with Caban and another man at the Fort Sheridan Forest Preserve, authorities said.
