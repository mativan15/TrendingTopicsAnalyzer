The Athletic's John Hollinger spent all of October predicting the records for all 30 NBA teams for the 2022-23 regular season.
For the Oklahoma City Thunder, the former NBA executive predicts they will finish with the worst record in the league at 20-62.
The Athletic writer Dave DuFour reacted to the prediction, agreeing with Hollinger's prediction as the loss of Chet Holmgren means the Thunder is basically bringing back the same team as last season's team — who went 24-58.
'This season's Oklahoma City Thunder squad isn't too terribly different from last season.
