A lack of mobile reception meant Dr Giuseppin had to offer medical advice over a landline phone call, which was then relayed to the crash site via two-way radio. Another time, he was unable to treat a child suffering minor burns after a video call dropped out due to poor connectivity. "The family had to drive a significant distance for a face-to-face consult, which could have been avoided had I been able to complete the consult via telehealth," Dr Giuseppin told AAP.
