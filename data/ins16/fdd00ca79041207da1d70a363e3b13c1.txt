I live in the country side of the Philippines where there isn't really any opportunities or learning materials I can have. I don't really have a lot of money for courses but I can afford cheap ones, I just really need a way to learn it. All I have is an old computer... How do I kickstart a web development career as well as learn how to properly learn it aside from tutorials on YouTube?
