Joe Biden is considering launching a national security review into Elon Musk's $44bn (£39bn) purchase of Twitter after the billionaire suggested that Ukraine should hand over occupied territory to Russia as part of peace talks.
US officials have become 'uncomfortable' about Mr Musk's recent comments on social media, including his recent threat to pull the plug on his Starlink satellite internet service in Ukraine.
Mr Musk became embroiled in a row with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this month after the Tesla chief executive proposed UN-supervised elections in four occupied regions that Moscow had attempted to annex.
