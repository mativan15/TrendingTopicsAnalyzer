Rahul Gandhi on Friday sharpened his attack on the BJP in Karnataka where he is undertaking the Congress's Bharat Jodo Yatra, the party's mass contact programme with an eye on the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. His latest tweet did not only have a reference to the '40 per cent commission' jibe that is often taken on the Basavaraj Bommai government by his party but also Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's remark last week on the Indian rupee.
