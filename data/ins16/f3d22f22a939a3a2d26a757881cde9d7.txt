Sundry Photography/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) shares rose on Friday as investment firm Raymond James upgraded the networking equipment company, citing new router contracts that may lead to a new cycle. Analyst Simon Leopold raised his rating on Juniper Networks (JNPR) to strong buy from outperform, noting that recent deal wins from Verizon (VZ) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) could wind up proving 2023 estimates too low. When combined with Ciena's (NYSE:CIEN) last report, as well Juniper-specific positives, the stock was worthy of an upgrade.
