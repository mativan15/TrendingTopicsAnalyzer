 LG is one of the biggest panel manufacturers on the planet and often sells its OLED panels to companies like Vizio, Hisense, and even Samsung as recently as last year. As such, it's no surprise that LG TVs are always among the best OLED TVs, although that also means that they cost an absolute ton, which is why we're always happy to see Best Buy TV deals like this on the LG 55-inch B2 Series OLED 4K Smart TV.
