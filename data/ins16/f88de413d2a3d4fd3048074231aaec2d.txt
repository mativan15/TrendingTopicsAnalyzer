Shares of LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB) have been hit by increased fears about a global recession, which would reduce demand for chemicals. Its large European operations also face the headwind of high inputs costs. While LYB has a trailing P/E of 5x, earnings and free cash flow are likely to fall substantially. Given this, shares are at about fair value, though the 5% secure dividend yield offers a reason to continue holding the stock. While it is a strong operator, until the market grows comfortable understanding how far EBITDA will fall, shares are unlikely to rebound substantially.
