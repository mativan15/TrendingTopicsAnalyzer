Nicola Sturgeon has published her long-awaited prospectus paper for Scottish independence covering economic and currency issues.

The third paper in the Building a New Scotland series aims to answer many 'big' questions around the economy of an independent Scotland.

It contains the most detail so far of any Scottish Government publication on how an independent Scotland would operate, aiming to refresh the case made ahead of the 2014 referendum.

Opponents of independence have said it fails to address many of the concerns around the economic impact of independence, while the First Minister said a 'stronger, fairer and more sustainable' economy is not possible under Westminster.
