Ryoshi, cryptocurrency Shiba Inu's pseudonymous founder has walked away from the SHIB community, and erased all of his tweets and blogs. Shiba Inu was launched as an alternative to Dogecoin (DOGE) in August 2020 by an anonymous person or group under the name Ryoshi. According to its founders, it was created as an experiment in decentralised spontaneous community building.
Ryoshi's identity has remained unknown since the project was launched in August 2020.  The meme-coin founder has often said that he would one day 'disappear'.
