The Russian government has set its sights on yet another U.S. tech company: Amazon.

This week a Russian court reportedly fined the e-commerce giant 4 million roubles (or $65,000 dollars) in two separate cases for allegedly refusing to remove content related to drug use and suicide, according to Reuters and Russian state media. The fines, a first for Amazon in Russia, represents the latest in an escalation of penalties dished out by the warring country in a trend rights groups warn may be degrading internet freedoms worldwide.
