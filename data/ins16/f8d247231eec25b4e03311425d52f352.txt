Fox has handed out a (very) early renewal to one of its upcoming animated series. The network has picked up a second season of Grimsburg, a comedy starring Jon Hamm as a down-on-his-luck detective. The series, an in-house production from Fox Entertainment and animation studio Bento Box that the network ordered a year ago, is set to premiere sometime in 2023. 'Grimsburg is yet another clear example of our strong commitment to, and intense focus on, upholding the high bar of standards any show must exceed in order to reside under the Animation Domination banner,' Fox Entertainment president Michael Thorn said in a statement.
