ON OCTOBER 17TH NATO began a fortnight of nuclear exercises in Belgium called Steadfast Noon. Later this month, NATO expects Russia to hold its own nuclear drills, called Grom, for the second time this year. Steadfast Noon, involving 60 aircraft from 14 allies—including B-52 bombers flown from America—is 'a routine, recurring training activity' unconnected to the war in Ukraine, NATO maintains. Yet the context is very far from routine; this week, NATO will be practising nuclear attacks during a major European war that some analysts fear could lead to nuclear escalation.
