The year 2022 has proven to be a stable one for the Indian real estate sector. Demand has surged in the residential sector, with strong end-user demand, driven by government stimulus and incentives offered by developers. Trends such as hybrid working, increased demand from IT/ITes companies, and e-commerce growth are keeping the commercial sector growing at a steady pace.
The real estate sector has rebounded despite challenges faced during the pandemic, to exceed pre-pandemic level demand. In 2022, the residential category saw an increase in capital values, as homebuyers demanded larger houses with better amenities.
