Tamil Nadu Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan said on Wednesday that the State is well-equipped to deal with any global financial downturn in future. If there is no such downturn, the public expenditure as a percentage of the State GDP will keep increasing and the fiscal deficit will keep decreasing, he said. He told the Assembly that the fiscal deficit was reduced to 3.38%, compared with 4.61% last year, and Tamil Nadu had improved its ability to seek loans by staying within the fiscal deficit limit prescribed by the Union government.
