Kim Kardashian is calling for the temporary release of a jailed father whose daughter was killed in the tragic elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.

The 41-year-old Keeping Up with the Kardashians alum posted a plea for Eli Torres to be temporarily freed so he can attend the funeral for his daughter, 10-year-old Eliahana "Ellie" Cruz Torres, who was one of the 21 victims.

Sharing a school photo of Ellie on her Instagram Stories and Twitter on Thursday, Kardashian wrote, "Her family are desperately hoping that her father, who is incarcerated for a non violent drug offense, be granted temporary release so that he can attend her funeral.
