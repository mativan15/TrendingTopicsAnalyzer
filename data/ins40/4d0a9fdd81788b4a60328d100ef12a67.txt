A WOMAN has been labelled "selfish" for not wanting to pay for her friend's holiday, but not everyone agrees with the judgement.
The holidaymaker was part of a group of friends who had all planned to visit Mexico together.

However, one of the group, who went by the name Mary, lost their job while the trip was still in the planning stage.
She then asked her friends if they could pay for her trip after she spent all of her own money on things like concerts and trips - and her own mum refused to cover the costs.
