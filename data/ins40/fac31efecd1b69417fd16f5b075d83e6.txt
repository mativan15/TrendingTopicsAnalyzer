Sony's Columbia Pictures has pushed back the release date for its live-action Harold and the Purple Crayon film by five months, from January 27 to June 30, 2023.

	The film from Oscar-nominated director Carlos Saldanha (Ferdinand) was previously set to open against Universal's genre-bender Distant with Anthony Ramos, IFC Films' Bob Odenkirk comedy Worlds Apart and Lionsgate's action-thriller Plane starring Gerard Butler. It will contend on its new date with James Mangold's Indiana Jones 5, in which Harrison Ford is joined by Fleabag‘s Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, Boyd Holbrook and more.
