About 50,000 student grant holders will receive a double payment on December 16th.The measure, announced in last month's budget, means those in receipt of maintenance payments will receive an additional payment ranging from €56-€679, depending on the relevant rate they are entitled to.In addition, students who paid the €3,000 student contribution in full for 2022/23 will receive a €1,000 refund from the college they attend over the coming weeks.This is in light of the budget announcement which has lowered the student contribution charge on a once-off basis for all students to €2,000.
