NEW YORK — Whatever chance the Yankees had of winning the American League Championship Series may have died in the eighth inning of Game 2 on Thursday when Aaron Judge's fly ball to right field was caught against the wall by Kyle Tucker.Instead of a two-run homer and the lead, the Yankees were left frustrated. Giancarlo Stanton struck out to end the inning and the Yankees punched out three more times in the ninth as the Astros secured a 3-2 victory.With the roof at Minute Maid Park open for only the second time this season, Yankees manager Aaron Boone grumbled about the wind holding the ball up.
