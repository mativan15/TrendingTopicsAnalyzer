Licensed Immigration Adviser Association chairperson Jens Mueller says some of the Government's planned changes to immigration settings will turn more migrants into temporary guest workers than the old system did. Mueller said there were some positives within the Government's recent immigration announcement about skilled migration, but there were also some worrying details 'hidden" in the consultation document that accompanied it. At the time of the announcement the focus was on changes to the existing points system, but less attention was paid to another set of proposed changes that would drastically alter the visa system in future.
