Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Lucid Group (LCID) failed to translate its top-line growth to bottom-line improvement in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. While the company mentioned strong demand for its offerings, chip shortage, material price inflation, and supply chain challenges might weigh on its growth prospects. Shares of LCID have lost more than 65% in price year-to-date and are expected to decline further amid the high inflation and resultant market turbulence. Hence, it could be wise to avoid this stock now.
