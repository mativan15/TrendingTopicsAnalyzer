OMAHA, Nebraska -- A survey of business managers in nine Midwest states shows more economic growth in the month just past. May's Mid-America Business Conditions Index fell to 60.0 from April's 65.9. On the Index's 0-100 scale, a reading of 50 is seen as growth neutral and anything above is positive. Creighton University Economist Ernie Goss says there is some caution in this month's survey. "For May, six out of 10 expect growth to slow for the rest of 2022. Slowing, but still positive," Goss says.
