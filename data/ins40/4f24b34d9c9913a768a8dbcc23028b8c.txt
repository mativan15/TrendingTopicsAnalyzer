wonry/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images My two favorite Chinese companies, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) and Baidu, Inc. (BIDU), reported their earnings recently, and the results were excellent. Both companies essentially knocked their earnings results out of the park, with Alibaba beating consensus EPS estimates by roughly 10% and Baidu smashing EPS estimates by more than 100%. Despite the stellar results, both companies are down by significant margins since their 2020 highs. Moreover, both companies are remarkably undervalued relative to their Western counterparts, and both companies are strong buys, in my view.
