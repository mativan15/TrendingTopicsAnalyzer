TWO HARBORS, Minn. — The controversial mayor of Two Harbors, recently given the option by the City Council to resign or face a recall election, is holding tight to his position — for now. "We're taking on bigger projects, and we're starting to move forward," Chris Swanson said Wednesday morning from a podium in the City Council chambers. "I will not resign." The mayor's future is in the hands of Two Harbors voters, who will have the choice whether to recall him on their ballot in August. If they vote him out, there will be a special election for a new mayor in the fall.
