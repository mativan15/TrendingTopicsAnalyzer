A McDonald's location in Wisconsin saw its longest "pay it forward" chain last week, as over 23 cars agreed to pay for the next person's order.The number is a new record for the restaurant, which previously stood at 15 people in a row, reports the Journal Times."McDonald's is proud to support its local communities. We are honored by this record-breaking act of kindness that took place in our Union Grove drive thru and humbled that so many individuals came together to keep it going," Rafael Luciano, McDonald's owner operator, told Newsweek.
