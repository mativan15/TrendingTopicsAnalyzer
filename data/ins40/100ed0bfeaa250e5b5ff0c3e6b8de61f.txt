STORY: Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he has a "super bad feeling" about the economy

He made the comment in an internal email seen by Reuters

Where he also said 10% of jobs at Tesla need to be axed

Carsten Brzeski, ING's Global Head of Macroeconomic Research:

"Musk's bad feeling is shared by many people... But we are not talking about global recession. We expect a cooling of the global economy towards the end of the year. The U.S. will cool off, while China and Europe are not going to rebound."

JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon has also warned of a coming 'hurricane'

Other companies are slashing jobs or slowing hires

In May, Netflix said it laid off about 150 people, mostly in the U.
