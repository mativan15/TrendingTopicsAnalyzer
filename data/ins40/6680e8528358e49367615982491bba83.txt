KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — A U.N. official is urging tech companies to do everything possible to stop the onslaught of hate speech fueling the war in Ethiopia's north, where a violent war pits federal troops and their allies against Tigray's rebellious leaders.

Inflammatory language by political leaders and armed groups in the Tigray conflict 'continues unabated,' Alice Wairimu Nderitu, U.N. special adviser on the prevention of genocide, said in a statement Wednesday.
