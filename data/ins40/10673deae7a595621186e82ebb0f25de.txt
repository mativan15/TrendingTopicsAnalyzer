The special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Tuesday discharged actor-producer Sachin Joshi from the money laundering case registered by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against Omkar Realters and its directors. The actor was arrested by ED on February 14, 2021. The agency alleged that Surana Developers LLP and Omkar Realtors and Developers Pvt Ltd had taken a loan of ₹410 crore from Yes Bank and gave all assets of Surana Developers LLP as collateral for the loan.
