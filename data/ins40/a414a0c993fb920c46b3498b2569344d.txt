BP's proposed $4.1 billion acquisition of Archaea Energy has it roots, like the renewable natural gas company itself, in the Pittsburgh region.

Archaea cofounders Nick Stork and Richard Walton were owners of several landfills in southwestern Pennsylvania who ended up developing their own plant that converts naturally occurring methane at the landfill to pipeline-ready natural gas. Their success led to the formation of Archaea Energy in 2018, with a base in Canonsburg, to develop similar projects for landfill owners that would be cost effective and productive.
