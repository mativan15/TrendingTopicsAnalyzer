Dear Editors
There may be outrage and support for Dr Arora from various medical organisations and media outlets (including the BMJ) as many doctors feel the injustice related to the ruling from the MPTS, resulting in a one month suspension.
But there is one impending danger that may occur which would seriously derail the grassroots support for the doctor.
While the MDU announced that it "is assisting the appeal of Dr Arora following the outcome of the MPTS hearing" (ref 1), there is no certainty that the appeal may actually occur.
