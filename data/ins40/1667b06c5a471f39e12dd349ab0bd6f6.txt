AgenciesSuella Braverman, Britain's interior minister resigned on Wednesday. The India-UK trade deal has been snared by Braverman's comments about Indian migrants overstaying their visas. The UK's new interior minister will be Grant Shapps, who was removed as transport minister when Liz Truss became UK PM. From 2020 to 2022, Braverman served as an Attorney General and was elected to the UK Parliament from Fairham. Under former PM Theresa May, she worked in the Brexit department as a junior minister but resigned in protest over her proposed Brexit deal.
