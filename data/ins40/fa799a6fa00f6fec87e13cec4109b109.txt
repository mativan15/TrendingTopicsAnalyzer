WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump is claiming clemency requests that he received while serving in the White House as well as other documents seized by the FBI from Mar-a-Lago related to immigration initiatives are his property and should be returned to him.

In a letter Thursday to the special master appointed to review the documents, Justice Department lawyers identified nine documents that Trump is arguing are his own "personal records citing the Presidential Records Act and a district court case.
