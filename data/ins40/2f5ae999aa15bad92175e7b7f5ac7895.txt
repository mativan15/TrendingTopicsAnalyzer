For many investors, the main point of stock picking is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Cedar Woods Properties Limited (ASX:CWP) shareholders, since the share price is down 42% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 17%. And the ride hasn't got any smoother in recent times over the last year, with the price 34% lower in that time.
