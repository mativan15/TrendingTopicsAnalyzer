Most people feel a little frustrated if a stock they own goes down in price. But often it is not a reflection of the fundamental business performance. Over the year the Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EDR) share price fell 17%. However, that's better than the market's overall decline of 25%. We wouldn't rush to judgement on Endeavor Group Holdings because we don't have a long term history to look at. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 11% in thirty days.
