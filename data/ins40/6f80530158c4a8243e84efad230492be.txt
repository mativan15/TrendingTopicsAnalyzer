It came as Professor Martin Marshall, GP and chair of the Royal College of GPs, joined Richard Madeley and Charlotte Hawkins on Tuesday's Good Morning Britain to discuss the issue, with Dr Daniel Olaiya agreeing with the notion that fines should be implemented for people who fail to turn up to GP appointments. As Professor Marshall insisted the NHS had to be "compassionate" and make home visits to people who have missed an appointment if they might be struggling mentally, Richard Madeley scoffed as he asked: "What are those?""What we need is a compassionate service, a service that's understanding," Prof Marshall explained.
