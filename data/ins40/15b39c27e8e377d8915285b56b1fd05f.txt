Both sides of politics have been challenged to find $1.2 billion a year for social housing to address a growing homelessness crisis, in a long-term plan that would also impose a 1 per cent social housing levy and zoning rules on developers.The new campaign from the state's peak homelessness body, ahead of the March election, details a specific program to make social housing equate for 10 per cent of all NSW residential dwellings by 2050. It is currently 4.7 per cent, below the OECD average of 7.1 per cent, Homelessness NSW said.
