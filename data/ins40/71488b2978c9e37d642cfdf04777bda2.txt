JHVEPhoto/iStock Editorial via Getty Images During the Q3 2022 earnings call, Joe Wolk, Chief Financial Officer of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), indicated plans to "rightsize" the organization ahead of the planned separation of its consumer health segment as a public company called Kenvue in 2023. "We have the opportunity, as we said on prior calls, to rightsize our infrastructure for a two-segment company versus a three-segment company that we've had historically," Wolk said, adding that the current macro concerns have also led to the decision.
