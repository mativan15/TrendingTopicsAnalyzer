Jun. 4—Veterans affairs was allowed to purchase new cabinets, the sheriff reported a significant increase in food vendor costs at the jail and the county's financial advisor was authorized to review the reinvestment district projects at Legacy Plaza during the Jasper County Board of Supervisors meeting on May 31.

Alyssa Wilson, administrator of Jasper County Veterans Affairs, presented the board with a quote for new cabinets. Wilson said her department is required to provide grave markers. Since the new veterans affairs office in the administration building has no storage room, Wilson said cabinets are needed to store markers.
