There was really no other way for this to play out.

After being run ragged by the Cleveland Guardians in a five-game series that took two days longer than anyone would have liked, the Yankees finally get another swing at Goliath. It's not often that the hegemonic franchise in the Bronx plays the role of David, but that's exactly who the Yankees are in this ALCS matchup with Houston, the third of the Aaron Judge era.

The Astros know they are better than the Yankees. They won 106 games to the Yankees' 99, beat the Yankees in five of the seven regular season matchups and have a much better top-to-bottom roster.
