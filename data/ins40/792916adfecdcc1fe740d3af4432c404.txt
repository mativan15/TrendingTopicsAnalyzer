United are reportedly locked in talks with Barcelona over the Dutch midfielder with Ten Hag pushing the club to step up efforts in the face of hesitation from De Jong.'Of course I [see the United rumours]," De Jong this week said. "But I have not heard anything from the club, so I assume that nothing is concrete, or that an agreement has already been reached. Then there's no point in worrying about it."He added: "Barcelona has always been my dream club, from an early age. It still is."AFP via Getty ImagesBarcelona are open to selling, with a fee of around £72million mooted by various outlets, and have earmarked three possible replacements.
