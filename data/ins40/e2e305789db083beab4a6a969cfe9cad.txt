The art of the ‘side hustle' – making a little bit extra after working nine to five – is becoming more of a necessity than a luxury as the cost of living rises.
Internet services group Fasthost has found that searches for the phrase ‘make extra money' have risen 132% since this time last year, with browsers hoping for information about evening jobs and tasks that will top up the coffers.
‘The current crisis is causing people to find other sources of income and help where they can, like selling clothes or setting up online stores for some extra financial security,' says Michelle Stark, sales and marketing director at Fasthosts.
