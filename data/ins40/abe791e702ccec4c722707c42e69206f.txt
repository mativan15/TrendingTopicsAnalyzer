There's a new chief stew in charge when Below Deck season 10 sets sail in St Lucia, and he is a very familiar face.
The beloved boat-based reality series is returning to Bravo on November 21, but it's all change in the cast once again.
In fact, Fraser Olender has taken over the interior crew in place of Heather Chase – who was met with controversy during her time on board last year when she was heard repeating the N-word during a crew night out, and later apologized for her actions.
Fraser, who served as second stew in the last series, is running the show on Motor Yacht St David, alongside ‘stud of the sea' Captain Lee Rosbach, who has assumed his rightful position in the wheelhouse.
