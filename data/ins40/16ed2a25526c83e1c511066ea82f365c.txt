Homebuilding stocks have gotten hammered this year. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF is currently down more than 25% from its high at the start of the year. Many issues have weighed on the homebuilder sector, including supply chain disruptions, rising costs, and higher mortgage rates. 
However, while the industry faces some near-term headwinds, America has a severe housing shortage, estimated at more than 5 million homes. So homebuilders believe their stocks are cheap, given the opportunity ahead. That's leading a growing number of homebuilders to launch meaningful share repurchase programs.
