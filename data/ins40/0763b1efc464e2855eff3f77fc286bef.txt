A growing list of investors signing up to help fund the $44 billion takeover of Twitter are betting on one big thing: Elon Musk.Though Twitter has spent years as an underperforming Silicon Valley punching bag, investors big and small are now scrambling for a piece of it, driven by optimistic revenue projections, their own strategic interests and fierce loyalty to a tech executive many see as infallible.It's unclear whether political motivations play a role in enthusiasm for the 16-year-old public company, though some of the deal's backers appear to share Musk's view that Twitter displays an anti-conservative bias and that its content moderation policies should be weakened in the name of free speech.
