Pakistan's finance minister said on Wednesday that his country was "actively considering" the option of importing oil from Russia on the pattern of India to offset the raging prices of fuel in the country. "I have sounded my intention about buying oil from Russia during my visit to the US and no opposition was expressed," Ishaq Dar told media, without elaborating with whom he discussed the idea. "Pakistan is actively considering buying oil from Russia but it should be at a price which is lower or at par with India," Dar said, adding that if India was buying oil then why Pakistan should be stopped from the same facility.
