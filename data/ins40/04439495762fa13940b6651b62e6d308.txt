Stephen Mulhern has admitted he has no plans on giving Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly their 21st National Television Award trophy, having accepted it on their behalf.
Ant and Dec have won the award for best presenter at the NTAs for the past 21 years running, with nobody else managing to nab the award since 2001.
However, the pair were unable to attend the event in person to collect their award at London's Wembley Arena, after contracting Covid days before the event.
