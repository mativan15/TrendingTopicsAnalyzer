On Friday evening, The Washington Post first reported that the Education Department made the student-loan forgiveness application available on its studentaid.gov website during a beta testing period. CNN later confirmed the application update and reported that the department is beta testing the website before it officially becomes available later in October, and borrowers will be able to officially submit the forms during this period.
