The recent crash in cryptocurrencies including the Terra stablecoin has bolstered RBI's argument that these are speculative and a risk to financial stability. It has refused a nod to private digital tokens. In an exclusive conversation with The Economic Times, the RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said that cryptos are speculative and "you cannot regulate nothingness".

"Crypto has no underlying. You cannot regulate nothingness. There has to be something to regulate. The prices can be volatile. In fact, it is a purely speculative activity.
