JaysonPhotography/iStock via Getty Images Stock bears were premature with their victory laps at the start of last month amid short-selling and negative feedback loops, J.P. Morgan global strategist Marko Kolanovic says. The S&P 500 (SP500) (NYSEARCA:SPY) closed out May flat, while the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) (QQQ) fell 1.7%. "As the market got into oversold conditions, it didn't take much to completely reverse losses - there were measured comments from the Fed (Bostic), and management of financial institutions giving hope that a policy error and recession may be avoided," Kolanovic wrote in a note Wednesday.
