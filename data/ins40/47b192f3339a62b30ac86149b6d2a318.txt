Brand new image renders have been revealed for the upcoming Manchester-based Co-op Live arena.

Boasting itself as the only music-first arena, the 23,500-capacity venue will feature an innovative 'smart bowl' which was inspired by conversations with rock legend Bruce Springsteen and star Harry Styles. The music-focused approach to the arena's design has resulted in an impressively large floor space, a noticeably lower ceiling, and tiered seating that allows fans to be as close as possible to their favourite musicians.
