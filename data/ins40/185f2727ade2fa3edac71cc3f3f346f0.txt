How about getting your eyes tested digitally on your personal computer, complete with an eyeglass prescription emailed to you at the end of it?This is what ShopDoc, a health-tech start-up incubated under the Kerala Startup Mission, promises to roll out in India on a free trial run basis on November 1 observed as Kerala Day. The technology, which was developed by the U.S.-based CLEAR, a digital eye care company founded by former NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) optical physicist Brandon Zimmerman, was launched on Thursday at Gitex Global 2022 held in Dubai.
