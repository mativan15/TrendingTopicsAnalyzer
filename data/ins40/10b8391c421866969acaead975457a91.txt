The Cleveland Guardians had their season come to a close on Tuesday evening when they lost Game 5 of their American League Division Series to the New York Yankees. Not even a full day later, word has surfaced that third baseman José Ramírez will undergo surgery on his right hand in a few weeks' time. He's expected to be hearty and hale by the time next spring training rolls around, according to ESPN's Enrique Rojas Wednesday.

The Athletic's Zack Meisel, meanwhile, added that Ramírez elected to play through his injury because an in-season operation would've required him to miss substantive time.
