It's a nippy morning in Saifai. The air is sombre and still. It has barely been a day since Samajwadi Party founder and Uttar Pradesh's former chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, fondly called ‘Netaji', was cremated with full state honours in the village.
But at Major Dhyan Chand Sports College, 11-year-olds Himanshu Yadav and Prince Yadav are excited. The two budding wrestlers are going to learn ‘Charkha Daav', a new move.
As they take their positions in the middle of a 144-square-metre wrestling mat in the indoor stadium, coach Kamlesh Kumar Yadav tells them about the technique made famous by Mulayam.
