Children who previously had COVID-19 or the inflammatory condition MIS-C are not protected against the Omicron variant of coronavirus, according to a study which found vaccination, however, does afford protection. The findings of the study, published recently in the journal Nature Communications, are similar to those found in adults. "I hear parents say, 'Oh, my kid had COVID last year,'" said Adrienne Randolph, of Children's Hospital, US, senior author of the research paper. "But we found that antibodies produced by prior infections in children don't neutralise Omicron, meaning that unvaccinated children remain susceptible to Omicron," Randolph said.
