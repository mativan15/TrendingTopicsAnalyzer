"Hell no, I ain't retired," the 35-year-old veteran told the I AM ATHLETE podcast this week. "I'm a free agent." The three-time Pro Bowl selection listed the Philadelphia Eagles and Green Bay Packers as preferred landing spots but also mentioned the Baltimore Ravens and a possible return to the Los Angeles Rams. "I'm going to put Philly first," Jackson said.
