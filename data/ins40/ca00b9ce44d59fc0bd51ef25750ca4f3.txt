India is on course to hit a demographic sweet spot in the next decade. The working-age population in the country is projected to rise from 50.5% in 2011 to about 58.8% in 2031. While such data looks good on paper, the true benefit of India's demographic dividend can be fully realised only when the young workforce is adequately skilled.
Currently, there is a huge gap between college-level preparedness and the skills required for success in the contemporary workplace. As per the latest India Skills Report, 75% of corporate leaders from 150 corporations across more than 15 industries and sectors believe a skill gap exists in their industry.
