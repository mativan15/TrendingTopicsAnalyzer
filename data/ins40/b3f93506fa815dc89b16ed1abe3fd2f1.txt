The 216-year-old British Residency, which was recently thrown open to visitors post restoration, seems to have caught the fancy of filmmakers here. A few scenes of the Kalyan Ram-starrer Devil are currently being filmed there and a couple of other production houses have also evinced interest in using the iconic property for movie shoots.The sculpted pillars, ornate papier mache ceiling and oval ballrooms of the Darbar Hall inside can easily transport one to the colonial era, making it the perfect setting for a period drama like Devil, whose tagline is ‘The British Secret Agent' alluding to the lead star's role.
