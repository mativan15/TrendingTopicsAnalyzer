A Manhattan federal court jury sided with actor Kevin Spacey in a civil trial brought by accuser Anthony Rapp, who claimed the Hollywood star tried to seduce him as a 14-year-old.
The jury determined Rapp had failed to prove Spacey inappropriately touched him after a party at his Manhattan apartment in 1986, when the 'Seven' star was 26 and both then-emerging actors were cast in separate Broadway plays.
Rapp will be awarded no money in damages because of the panel's decision.
