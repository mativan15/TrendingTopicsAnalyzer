In the past three years, the share price of Clean Seas Seafood Limited (ASX:CSS) has struggled to grow and now shareholders are sitting on a loss. What is concerning is that despite positive EPS growth, the share price has not tracked the trend in fundamentals. Shareholders may want to question the board on the future direction of the company at the upcoming AGM on 28 October 2022. They could also try to influence management and firm direction through voting on resolutions such as executive remuneration and other company matters.
