A month after winning a stunning acquittal on all charges, the attorney for R. Kelly's former business manager Derrel McDavid has filed an unusual request to force the government to pony up McDavid's nearly million-dollar legal tab as penalty for bringing a case that he says was 'vexatious, frivolous and in bad faith.'

The long-shot motion filed Tuesday by attorney Beau Brindley alleged the evidence against McDavid was 'irreconcilably conflicted and incoherent,' and that he deserves payment after successfully defending himself against a 'capricious and overzealous prosecution.
