Ukraine beat Scotland 3-1 on Wednesday in their first competitive match since Russia's invasion in February.

However, Page stressed that his side cannot be distracted by the visitors' suffering off the field with a historic chance to end a 64-year wait to reach the World Cup.

"The message pre-camp was if we could take away what they are going through in a heartbeat we would, but now this is business," said Page at his pre-match press conference on Saturday.
