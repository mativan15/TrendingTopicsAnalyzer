The Metropolitan Police is offering £5,000 to attract new police constables in a recruitment drive.

The force said it was 'taking bold steps' to recruit a record number of police officers in the next ten months.

As the recovery from Covid continues, the Met Police said they have seen the job market in London rebound and change quickly.

They said they have more job opportunities, fewer people looking for work and more officers are choosing to retire.

Through its National Police Uplift Programme, they hope to recruit another 4,000 new officers by March 2023.
