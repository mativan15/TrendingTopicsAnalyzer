A Raleigh company spent more than $100 million on a student housing development serving North Carolina State University and other local colleges.

The Preiss Company paid $102.61 million to acquire Valentine Commons, a 928-bed property across from Doak Field at Dail Park, according to a Wake County deed dated Sept. 30. The student housing and multifamily company will invest an additional $10 million in property improvements.

The total assessed value of the property is currently $90.22 million.
