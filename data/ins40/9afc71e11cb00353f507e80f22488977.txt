NHS chiefs spent £18,000 on speed bumps for a mile-long stretch of road, only to rip them out months later.
More than 200 bollards and 44 speed bumps were installed at the entrance to Neuadd Hospital near Conwy, North Wales.
But less than seven months later, bosses have U-turned on the ‘traffic calming' measure after a string of complaints from drivers.
One hospital worker, who remained anonymous, said the bumps were ‘overkill' and a ‘waste of money'.
They said: ‘It was tricky coming and going, there was real danger to car getting damaged, everyone was trying to avoid going over them as best they could.
