Even if growth is stellar, shares of a company that is classified as a growth prospect can be extremely volatile. One great example of this volatility can be seen when looking at Chewy (NYSE:CHWY). On June 2nd, after reporting financial results covering the first quarter of its 2022 fiscal year, shares of the pet-centric online retailer Chewy skyrocketed, closing up 24.2%. This follows months of decline as investors worry about increased competition from online retailers like Amazon (AMZN) and as they become concerned about the broader economy.
