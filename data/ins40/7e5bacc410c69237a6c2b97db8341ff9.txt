Political strategist Prashant Kishor on Wednesday said Bihar chief minister and Janata Dal (United) supremo Nitish Kumar is in talks with the BJP and if the situation arises, he might renew his alliance with the saffron camp. The JD(U), which had snapped ties with the BJP earlier this year to bring back the Mahagathbandhan back in power along with the Lalu Prasad-led RJD, dismissed the claims as misleading and aimed at spreading confusion.
