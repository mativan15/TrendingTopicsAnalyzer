Sony has revealed when you'll be able to get your hands on its premium DualSense Edge controller for PlayStation 5 , but be prepared to shell out a pretty penny for it. The $200 peripheral will be available on January 26th in the US, UK, France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Pre-orders will open on PlayStation Direct on October 25th.

The DualSense Edge is "built with high performance and personalization in mind," Sony says . You can swap out the standard thumbstick caps, for instance, and use the included high dome caps or low dome caps instead.
