The England and Wales football team managers have joined forces with the government to warn fans attending the World Cup to respect Qatar's drug and alcohol laws.The call came as thousands of Turkish police and bomb squad officers arrived to help provide security for the tournament, during which more than a million visitors will squeeze into a country smaller than Yorkshire.The event marks the first time that either the Olympics or the World Cup has been held in the Middle East, and Qatar will be by far the smallest country to have hosted such an event.
