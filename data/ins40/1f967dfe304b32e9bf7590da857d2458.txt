Erik Khalitov David Einhorn's hedge fund Greenlight exited investments in Chemours (NYSE:CC), Playboy (NASDAQ:PLBY), Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) and International Seaways (NYSE:INSW) in Q3. Greenlight exited Chemours (CC) due to concern about the deteriorating economic cycle, according to a copy of Greenlight's Q3 letter viewed by Seeking Alpha. The hedge fund exited Chemours after a 3-year investment. "While the company could release substantial value by separating its commodity-driven titanium dioxide business from its rapidly growing ESG-friendly refrigerant business, we do not believe that management is currently interested in pursuing a separation," Einhorn wrote in the investor letter.
