State Attorney Dave Aronberg says it will go a long way in helping to solve some of the 489 cold case murders that date all the way back to the 1960's. "With new technology we now have the ability to increase the DNA profiles to allow law enforcement to test DNA that could not be tested before." He says the money will pay for more genetic genealogy testing, where DNA samples are sent to private labs and entered into a public database to find a match.
