Scott Olson/Getty Images News Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) should reject a suggestion from activist Third Point that it separate its Hill's Pet Nutrition business, according to analysts. Third Point's Dan Loeb is advocating that Colgate (CL) separate its Hill's pets business and believes the segment could be valued at $20 billion on its own, according to a 3Q investor letter from Tuesday. Third Point has taken a stake of about $1 billion in Colgate, according to CNBC's David Faber. "Whilst there may be some short-term logic to realizing an elevated value for Hill's today, given recent elevated pet-care growth during the pandemic, we struggle to see how divesting its best business is likely to be at all beneficial to CL shareholders over the long-term," Bernstein analyst Callum Elliott, who has a market perform rating and $80 price target on CL, wrote in a note on Tuesday.
