OTTAWA - The chair of Canada's broadcasting regulator says there will be challenges along the way but the body is well equipped to iron out the details of a bill that seeks to regulate online news.

Ian Scott, head of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, told a House committee that he has already sought input from other jurisdictions where similar laws are already in place, such as Australia.

Bill C-18 would require tech giants to negotiate deals to pay media outlets in order to make their news content available on major online platforms.
