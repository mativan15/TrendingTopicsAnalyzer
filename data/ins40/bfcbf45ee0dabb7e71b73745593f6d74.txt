Some Indigenous-run child welfare agencies are warning that Ottawa's planned overhaul of the Indigenous child welfare system could leave thousands of kids and families without services.The federal government is planning to redirect funding from Indigenous child and family services agencies to communities as part of a $20 billion reform package now being negotiated by Ottawa and First Nations leaders.That sum amounts to half of Ottawa's historic $40 billion settlement agreement on child welfare. The other $20 billion has been set aside for individual compensation.
