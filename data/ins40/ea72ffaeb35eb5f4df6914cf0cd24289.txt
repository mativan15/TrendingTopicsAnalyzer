Vistry has kicked off a £35million share buyback programme after enjoying a ‘strong start' to the year.
The housebuilder, formerly Bovis Homes, said it was returning excess capital to investors after ‘robust trading' and debt falling below its £100million target. 
Last week, Vistry posted an upbeat update and said profits would top expectations thanks to strong demand for its homes and higher prices.

Housebuilders started 2021 on a strong foot as home hunters continued to rush to buy its new-built homes before the stamp duty holiday ended in July last year.
