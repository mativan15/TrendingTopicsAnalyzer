Meanwhile, University Hospitals Plymouth spent £4,463 on private health insurance in the last year. The trust said the insurance was for administrative staff. 
Asked on Wednesday afternoon which employees were given private health insurance, a spokesman said that the trust was unable to respond to questions over the bank holiday weekend.
East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust revealed that it had paid £125,000 to Physio Med, an occupational physiotherapy firm, since 2018, including £43,000 last year.
