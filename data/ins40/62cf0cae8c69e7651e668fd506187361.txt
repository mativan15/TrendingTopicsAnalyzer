The cooler, October weather was always the best time to sit under the tiki at Golden Rule seafood restaurant in Palmetto Bay — before a fire gutted the hut.

But three months after an errant firework torched the tiki, the restaurant has built a new outdoor hut and will debut it Oct. 22, just in time for cool Miami weather, the owner of the family-run restaurant said.

'We really needed it. That's the draw, what people come here for,' said manager Courtney Reeder, whose family has owned the market and restaurant since the 1960s.
