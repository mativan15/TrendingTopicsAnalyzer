The Tide also have a chance to secure the top seed in the SEC Tournament with two games to go.

Make it 11 wins in a row for coach Wes Hart and Alabama Soccer as the Crimson Tide defeat the Mississippi State Bulldogs 4-1 in Starkville. The Tide not only remain undefeated in SEC play, they have won the SEC West.

The entire game was a physical battle between the two teams as they combine for 21 fouls and three yellow cards over the course of the game. Hart told BamaCentral after the game that while physicality is a part of the game, he felt that the team was too invested in that aspect early on.
