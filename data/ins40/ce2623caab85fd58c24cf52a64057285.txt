UK firms face a grim outlook as growth is forecast to "flatline" in the next quarter as economic headwinds and the cost of living crisis bite.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) anticipates private sector activity to be broadly flat in the three months to August, marking the lowest expectations for private sector growth since February 2021.

Companies face a hit from a reduction in household consumption as economic growth is set to weaken and inflation likely to peak again in October amid surging energy bills and is forecast to hit 10% by the end of this year.
