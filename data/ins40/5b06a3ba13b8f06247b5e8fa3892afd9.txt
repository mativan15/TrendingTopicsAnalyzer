Scott Pruitt, a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency during the Trump administration, regularly asked his federal security detail to speed and use sirens and emergency lights because he was running late to meetings, according to a federal report released Thursday. In one 2017 instance, a special agent drove Pruitt with the vehicle's lights and sirens on through oncoming traffic. The administrator was running late for an agency meeting and needed to pick up his dry cleaning.'Can you guys use that magic button to get us through traffic?' Pruitt said during another instance, according to an account in the report.
