When Papanicolaou heard the alarm she unplugged the medical alert base station and stole the landline phone, fleeing the home by jumping the back fence and taking the phone and a bloodied kitchen knife.The base station had a backup battery and an operator was able to call an ambulance after hearing Mrs Welsh screaming 'help' and 'please help me'.Papanicolaou later claimed to police that Mrs Welsh was the one who attacked her first.In sentencing remarks on Friday, Justice Robertson Wright said Mrs Welsh, who had hearing aids and a pacemaker, kept about $1600 in a drawer in her home and would usually pay Papanicolaou with cash.
