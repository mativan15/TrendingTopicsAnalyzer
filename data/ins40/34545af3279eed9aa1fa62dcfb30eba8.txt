Bill Gates says he still believes it's possible to avoid a climate disaster, but to do so will require substantial spending by the world's richest countries—a sentiment that might not go over well as the threat of a global recession grows. Solving the ecological threat the planet faces, says Gates in a Tuesday blog post titled, 'State of the Energy Transition,' will require the invention of clean technologies that replace the current ways we make things like steel and fertilizer. The cost of those technologies, he says, will have to be low enough that they can be utilized around the world—and deploying them must also be cost competitive.
