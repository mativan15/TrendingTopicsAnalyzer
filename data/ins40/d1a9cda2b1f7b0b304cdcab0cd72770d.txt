A ministry of Italy's government says it will remove from its walls a photo of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini after its recent display led to an uproar from trade unions and a former minister.

Mussolini's legacy is in the spotlight as Italy prepares to install its most right-wing government since World War II, led by Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy party, whose roots go back to the post-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI).

The Mussolini portrait will be taken down "to avoid polemics and manipulations," the ministry of economic development said in a statement.
