KathyDewar/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) released second quarter earnings results which showed resilient growth in spite of lower units sold amidst supply chain disruptions. Warren Buffett, through his company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), had purchased a stake in the company back in April. Investors seem to have forgotten that entrance as the stock is not trading far from where it did back then. While HPQ is unlikely to report juicy growth rates, it remains a cash cow and a willing repurchaser of its own stock.
