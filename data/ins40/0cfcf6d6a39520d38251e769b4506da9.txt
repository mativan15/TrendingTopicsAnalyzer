Serie A giants Inter Milan have reportedly been offered the chance to sign Chelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek during the summer transfer window.

The 26-year-old has spent his entire professional career on the Chelsea books. But despite making his senior debut way back in December 2014, the talented schemer has never been a permanent first-team fixture. He has made just 122 appearances and scored 13 goals, starting many games on the bench.
