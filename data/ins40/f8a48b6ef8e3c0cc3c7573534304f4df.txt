The late Anne Zacerkowny of Sudbury was a long-time player of OLG Instant games. "Her family told us her favourite things in life were her family and playing Instant games – so much so, that her family paid tribute to her love of OLG Instants by playing the OLG 'winner/gagnant' jingle during a video at her funeral," the OLG said in a news release Thursday. "When Anne found out she had won a spin of The Big Spin, she was so excited to come to the OLG Prize Centre and spin the wheel. She even had a special outfit chosen for the special event.
