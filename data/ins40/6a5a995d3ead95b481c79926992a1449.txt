Account sharing for Netflix is poised to become a lot harder for freeloading users early next year.

Netflix plans on rolling out 'a thoughtful approach to monetize account sharing' in early 2023, the company wrote in a shareholders' letter(Opens in a new window) released alongside its Q3 earnings.

This approach will allow existing Netflix subscribers to pay more money to add 'extra members,' who will then be able to stream from the same account. The company already tested the system in three Latin American countries earlier this year, where Netflix charged customers an extra $2.
