Just five years ago, Great Britain's Neah Evans was working as a veterinary surgeon. The Scottish athlete comes from a sporting family including her mother Ros, who competed in cross-country skiing at the Winter Olympics Sarajevo 1984 and brother Donald, who won gold at the 2014 Commonwealth Rowing Championships. But while cycling was a passion, it wasn't until 2017 that Evans left behind her day job to concentrate on the sport full-time.'Ultimately it's my choice,' she told Cycling Weekly in 2018, looking back on her decision to swap her career caring for animals for long hours of training in the cold Aberdeen winter.
