On a scale of most to least likely people to find at your Platinum Jubilee street party this weekend, Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are probably so far down on the list that they might even appear below Oliver Cromwell, or the actual Queen herself.But stranger things have happened, apparently. In case you missed it, the couple were actually spotted stepping out for a date in London on Monday night, just in time for the Jubilee celebrations. Whether they actually arrived for the big weekend or whether it's all just a happy coincidence and they're now wondering whether there have always been more union jacks than people in the UK is thus far unclear, but I'm choosing to believe it's the former.
