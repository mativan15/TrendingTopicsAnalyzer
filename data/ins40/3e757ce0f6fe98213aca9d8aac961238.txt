A former Miss New Jersey has joined NBC10 as a general assignment reporter.

Brenna Weick will work weekend mornings and starts Oct. 31.

Weick spent the past five years working for Waterman Broadcasting Corp. in Fort Myers, Florida, as a reporter and weekday evening anchor. She was part of the team that was recently honored with an Edward R. Murrow award for breaking news coverage for 'In the Tiger's Mouth,' a story about a tiger attack at a local zoo.

'Brenna brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to NBC10,' said Elizabeth Flores, vice president of news at NBC10 and Telemundo62, in a statement.
