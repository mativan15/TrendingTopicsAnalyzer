Australians have handed over more than $205 million to scammers in the past four months but the true losses are set to be higher.

While many are alert to scam telephone calls, the culprits have moved to SMS to catch unsuspecting people in their path.

The majority of losses between January 1 and May 1 were to investment scams with $158 million lost - an increase of 314 per cent on the same period last year, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.

Most losses to investment scams involved cryptocurrency investments, with $113 million reported lost this year.
