CNN announced their newest hire Wednesday, and it's being met with its share of backlash from the left. Stephen Gutowski, the founder of The Reload, a news organization committed to 'sober, serious reporting on–as well as analysis of–firearms policy and politics,' will join the newsroom as a firearms contributor in the network's latest bid to be a moderate news destination.

'THIS is who CNN just hired as a commentator on guns,' wrote Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, a grassroots movement dedicated to addressing gun violence in the U.
