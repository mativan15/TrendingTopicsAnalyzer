Recalled England winger Ryan Hall is hoping to hit all the right notes – on and off the pitch.The 34-year-old, set to feature in Saturday's game against France, has found an unusual way of relaxing during the Rugby League World Cup campaign… learn a Debussy classical piece on piano.'I've been trying Clair de Lune, which is a tough one,' he said. 'It's all about the touch and you can't just play the notes, you've got to really feel it – you've got to play it well or you'll end up butchering it.'I played saxophone all through school and then in camp when we're staying in hotel-based situations, sometimes there's a piano knocking about in the hotel that we're staying in.
