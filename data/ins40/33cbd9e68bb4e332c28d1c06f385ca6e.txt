Anthony Devlin Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) is preparing for the release of its all-electric Jeep Avenger, which features 154 horsepower and a targeted range of around 249 miles. A dual-motor, all-wheel-drive variant of the electric SUV is also planned. The automaker will start to take reservations for the Avenger on Monday and the model is expected to arrive in showrooms next year. Stellantis (STLA) execs think the Jeep Avenger will help the brand double sales in Europe next year to 300K. Overall, Stellantis (STLA) plans to double the percentage of electric car models it produces in France with some new models of its Peugeot brand set to be produced in the Mulhouse plant.
