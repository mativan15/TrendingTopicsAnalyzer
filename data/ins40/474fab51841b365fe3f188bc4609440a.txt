NEW DELHI: Samsung Display will shut down its liquid-crystal display business by June this year amid escalating competition from its Chinese and Taiwanese counterparts on the pricing front, The Korea Times reported citing the industry. The decision by the Samsung Group firm has come six months earlier than expected, largely due to rapid losses from falling LCD prices, the report added. Also, Samsung Electronics, the largest buyer of Samsung Display's products has been partnering with global LCD suppliers, including China's BOE Technology Group and Taiwanese LCD panel maker AU Optronics Corp.
