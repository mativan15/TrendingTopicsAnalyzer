May 31, 2022 / 10:43 AM / CBS/AP U.S. stocks opened lower on Tuesday after the European Union agreed to ban most Russian oil imports by year-end, sparking a fresh spike in global oil prices.While Wall Street veered away from a bear market on Friday, inflation and rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and China's slowing economy are all punishing stocks and raising fears about a possible U.S. recession. The S&P 500 slipped 27 points, or 0.6%, to 4,131 in early trade. The benchmark index is down 13% on the year.
