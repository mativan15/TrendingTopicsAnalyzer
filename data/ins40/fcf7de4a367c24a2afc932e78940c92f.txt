Tens of thousands of Britain's poorest families stand to miss out on a huge boost to their incomes next year in Rishi Sunak's £15bn package to ease the cost of living crisis thanks to the benefits cap.Benefits payments are set to soar by as much as 10 per cent from April, the chancellor has confirmed, but more than 120,000 households will lose out unless ministers raise the cap on how much they can receive from the state.Experts warned that unless the government acts, more families, many of whom have children under five, will hit the ceiling on payments.
