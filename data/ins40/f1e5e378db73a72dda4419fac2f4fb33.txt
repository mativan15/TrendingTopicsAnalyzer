Russian gas giant Gazprom said on Thursday its board was recommending a dividend of 52.53 roubles per share on its 2021 results, up from 12.55 roubles for the previous year.It said the total payout will amount to 1.244 trillion roubles ($20.10 billion), or 50 per cent of adjusted group net income, adding that this was a record high in Russian stock market history.The 50 per cent ratio was the same as before, but the payout was higher because of record earnings last year on the back of high oil and gas prices.
