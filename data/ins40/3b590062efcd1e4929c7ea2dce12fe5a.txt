A B.C. gun and ammunition store owner says handgun sales in the Lower Mainland have sky-rocketed following the Liberal government announcement about a handgun sale freeze.
Scott Carpenter, owner of International Shooting Supplies in Surrey, said he sold a month's worth of sales in one day.'I just want to apologize to the 70-plus people who've left messages that I can't return right now,' Carpenter said.'(I want to) let (people) know, we're at the top of the wave and don't know what we'll do next.
