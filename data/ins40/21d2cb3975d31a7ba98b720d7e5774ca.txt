While millions of dollars in donations to support last winter's convoy protest came from outside Canada, the national spy agency told officials during the protest that the money did not appear to be coming from foreign states or "foreign actors."In a summary of a Feb. 6 call tabled with the inquiry examining the government's decision to invoke the Emergencies Act to deal with the convoy protest, David Vigneault, director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), described what his service was seeing.
