The Tennessee Titans have reached an agreement with Nashville government to build a new $2.1 billion domed stadium, a project that includes $1.26 billion total in money from the state of Tennessee and local revenue bonds. It's among the highest totals of public funds ever committed to a U.S. sports venue, but one that city officials argue will save taxpayers money because of the onerous lease it replaces and the specific sources of the funds.

The metro government of Nashville and Davidson County will contribute $760 million via revenue bonds, and the state is adding $500 million via a one-time contribution.
