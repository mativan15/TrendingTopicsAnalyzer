Britain's biggest luxury yacht-builder is being put up for sale even as a string of the world's most valuable private vessels are being seized by governments clamping down on their sanctioned Russian owners.Sky News has learnt that L Catterton, the private equity group, has hired bankers at Macquarie to find a buyer for Plymouth-based Princess Yachts.
A formal process is yet to get under way but is expected in the coming months, according to City sources.Princess's valuation was unclear on Friday, although one insider indicated that it was unlikely to represent one of L Catterton's most successful exits.
