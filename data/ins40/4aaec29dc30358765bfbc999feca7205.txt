Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Vodafone Group Public Limited Company (LON:VOD) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next two days.

The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend.
