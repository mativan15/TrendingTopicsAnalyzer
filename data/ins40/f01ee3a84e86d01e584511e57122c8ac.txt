Calling Himachal his ‘karmbhoomi' (work land), Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said he promptly accepted the suggestion to be in the state to mark the eight years of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, led by his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Addressing a rally on The Ridge after leading a roadshow in Shimla on Tuesday, the PM said, 'I always see myself as a member of the family of 130 crore citizens and not as a Prime Minister. If I am able to do anything for the country, it is only because of the blessings and good wishes of 130 crore countrymen.
