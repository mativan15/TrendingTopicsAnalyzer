Kyiv is attacked by Iranian-made drones

Russia attacked Ukraine's capital yesterday with Iranian-made drones, continuing its campaign of strikes against Ukrainian energy infrastructure and civilian targets. The attacks came during morning rush hour, killing at least four people.

The strikes highlighted Russia's growing use of the Iranian-made self-destructing drones, which make a buzzing sound like a moped or a lawn mower and explode on contact. The Shahed-136 drones have a range of about 1,500 miles and carry warheads of about 80 pounds, but are slow and easy to target.
