Win McNamee Eurofins Scientific (OTCPK:ERFSF) has been active on the M&A front. Most recently, the company announced its first material buyback program involving the repurchase of up to 2% of its share capital (equivalent to ~4m at the time of announcement). This follows Eurofins' divestment of its Digital Testing business at a favorable valuation, another important milestone in the company's capital allocation journey. With ~EUR220m of capital freed up, the company has ample runway to fund its mid to long-term priorities, either via acquisitions to build its leadership in bio-analytical testing and other life science areas or by ramping up capex for laboratories and accelerating firm-wide digitalization.
