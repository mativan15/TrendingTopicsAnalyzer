Audicus provides a range of affordable, direct-to-consumer hearing aids with advanced features. Customers can test for, purchase, and, in some cases, adjust these hearing aids entirely online. Audicus also partners with Albertsons to provide in-person appointments in a few markets.
Key Features

Testing, purchase and maintenance can all be conducted online, though you can try Audicus products in person at Albertsons stores in New York, Denver, and Chicago.
New features are introduced regularly, such as Bluetooth connectivity and adaptive-directional microphones designed to work in crowded settings.
