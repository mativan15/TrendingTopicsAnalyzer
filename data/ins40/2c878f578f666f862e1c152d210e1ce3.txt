Srinagar: Two back-to-back targeted attacks in Kashmir have again exposed chinks within the security apparatus that militants seem to identify and take advantage of by hitting specific targets, especially non-local labourers, migrant and non-local employees and Kashmiri Pandits time and again.These back-to-back attacks came days after home minister Amit Shah while addressing a big rally in Baramulla town earlier this month had said that militancy was in its last stage in J&K. 'From a terror spot, now, it's a tourist spot,' Shah had said while referring to 18 lakh tourists who visited Kashmir this year.
