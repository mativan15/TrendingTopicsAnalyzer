Oct 19 (Reuters) - Futures tracking Canada's main stock index slipped on Wednesday as prices of precious metals dropped, while investors awaited domestic inflation data to gauge the future path of interest rate hikes.

Futures on the S&P/TSX index slipped 0.1% at 07:01 a.m. ET as U.S. stock index futures also wobbled.

Data at 8:30 a.m. ET is expected to show consumer prices rose 6.8% in September after posting a 7.0% growth in the previous month, according to a Reuters poll of economists.

A recent cooling of inflation numbers have pushed traders to bet on a smaller interest rate hike by the Bank of Canada when it meets next week.
