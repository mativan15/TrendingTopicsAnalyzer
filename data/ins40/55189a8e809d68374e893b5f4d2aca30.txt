PHILADELPHIA — Bryce Harper had done nothing Saturday afternoon by the time he walked to the plate in the sixth inning. Not at the plate, where he had struck out twice and popped to center in three at-bats. Not in the field, where he no longer appears because he is the Philadelphia Phillies' designated hitter.

The chants came anyway.
