More than five years after neighborhoods near downtown San Jose flooded following a series of major storms, Silicon Valley's largest water agency has agreed to settle lawsuits from more than 200 people who suffered losses.
The Santa Clara Valley Water District, a government agency based in San Jose that provides drinking water and flood control to much of Santa Clara County, will pay $8.25 million by June 15 to 231 families and individuals whose homes and belongings were submerged under a torrent of muddy, rising water when Coyote Creek burst over its banks on Feb.
