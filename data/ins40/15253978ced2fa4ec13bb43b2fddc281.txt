Danone's history in Russia began in 1992 with the opening of a dairy products store near Red Square in Moscow. It is coming to an end with the decision, made official on Friday, October 14, to sell control of its Russian subsidiary. A difficult choice: the French group employs 7,200 people in the country. In a statement, the food giant said: "Danone is announcing (...) its decision to launch the process of transferring control of its Essential Dairy and Plant-based (EDP) business in Russia. [The group] believes that this is the best option to ensure the continued operational performance of this business, for its employees, consumers and partners.
