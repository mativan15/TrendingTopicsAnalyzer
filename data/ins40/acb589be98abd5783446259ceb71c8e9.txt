Much of the US and Canada has a higher than normal risk of blackouts this year. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation warns that above average temperatures (which drive up demand for electricity) and an ongoing drought (which decreases supply of hydroelectricity) could cause problems for chunks of the grid this year. Avoiding this kind of blackout would require reducing demand or increasing supply. If a blackout does occur in your area, a backup power source like a portable power station or a generator can keep some of your lights on.
