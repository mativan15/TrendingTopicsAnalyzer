The Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Gemini Trust on Thursday, alleging that employees at the cryptocurrency exchange misled the agency when the company was evaluating a potential bitcoin futures contract.Filed in a New York federal court, the complaint claims that Gemini violated the Commodities Exchange Act for making 'false or misleading statements and omissions' to CFTC staff through in-person interviews, presentations materials, and documents in July and December 2017.Doing so 'undermines the CFTC's work to ensure the financial integrity of all transactions subject to the CEA, protect market participants, deter and prevent price manipulation, and promote responsible innovation and fair competition,' said Acting Director of Enforcement Gretchen Lowe in the statement.
