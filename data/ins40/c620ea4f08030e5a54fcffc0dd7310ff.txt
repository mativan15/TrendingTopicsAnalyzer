A bounce in U.S. stocks last week snapped a seven-week losing streak for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, while the Dow logged gains for the first time in eight weeks.

These gains ended the longest weekly losing streak in over a decade for the S&P 500 after the index tip-toed into bear market territory. All three major indexes logged weekly gains of at least 5%, buoyed by a batch of upbeat economic data and more positively received earnings reports from the retail sector.

The S&P 500 has snapped a losing streak of this length only three other times in history — 1970, 1980, and 2001 — and twice the index rose 33% over the next 12 months, according to data from LPL Financial.
