By Australian Associated Press Published: 15:05 EDT, 15 October 2022 | Updated: 15:05 EDT, 15 October 2022 Australian workers living in the outer suburbs of cities need roads to get to work and business hubs developed closer to where they live. The one in five Australians who live on the outskirts of major cities are missing out, according to an alliance of councils from across the country. With a labour force of more than 2.2 million, industrial land ready to develop and freight and transport facilities that keep Australia moving, outer urban areas only need investment in roads and services, they say.
