By Australian Associated Press Published: 03:15 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 03:15 EDT, 18 October 2022 Nick D'Agostino has a simple message for Melbourne City ahead of their A-League derby: be prepared for Victory's angry side. Victory were left bruised and stinging after failing to come to the party in their 1-0 loss to Western Sydney on Saturday night. Coach Tony Popovic said his charges didn't deserve to win that game and striker D'Agostino indicated the players had received a dressing-down accordingly ahead of another Melbourne derby at AAMI Park.
