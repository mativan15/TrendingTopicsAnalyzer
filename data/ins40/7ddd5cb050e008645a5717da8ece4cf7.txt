DUBAI, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has made a tender offer to holders of existing bonds to purchase them for cash and may issue new debt securities, a London Stock Exchange filing showed on Tuesday.

Saudi Arabia's finance ministry has invited holders of its $3 billion bonds due in 2023, $4.5 billion notes due in April 2025, $2.5 billion bonds due in October 2025 and $5.5 billion notes maturing in 2026.

The ministry said it intends to issue a series of new U.S. dollar-denominated fixed rate notes under its global medium-term note programme as well as new dollar sukuk, or Islamic bonds, subject to market conditions.
