Researchers found that women are more at risk of requiring knee surgery if they put on weight in midlife compared to men.Women who gained 11lb (5kg) are 34 per cent more likely to need a total knee replacement, while men were 25 per cent more likely if they put on the same amount of weight.The new study, which will be presented at the International Congress on Obesity in Melbourne, found that relatively small weight increases could heighten the chance of developing knee osteoarthritis and the need for a knee replacement.
