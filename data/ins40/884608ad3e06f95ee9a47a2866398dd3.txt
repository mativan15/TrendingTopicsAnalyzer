Published: 08:59 EDT, 28 May 2022 | Updated: 08:59 EDT, 28 May 2022 Barcelona have made Napoli centre back Kalidou Koulibaly their top defensive target this summer, according to reports in Spain. Koulibaly, who has been with the Italian club since 2014, has reportedly stalled on accepting a new contract with his current deal set to expire in 2023.Napoli had tried to get the Senegal international to sign an extension, but appear to have accepted that the player will not sign and as such will look to sell him on this summer to ensure he does not go for free next year.
