(Bloomberg) -- A SPAC that counts former US House Speaker Paul Ryan as chairman became the latest vehicle to be bailed on by investors who want their money back.Executive Network Partnering Corp. saw roughly 95% of its investors opt to swap their shares for $10 when they voted on a tie-up with oil and gas company Granite Ridge Resources Inc. The deal will leave a little more than two million of the initial 41 million shares outstanding ahead of the merger's closing. The recent rise in redemptions is among the many problems hitting SPAC sponsors, as investors who either don't like the deal, or simply want their initial investment back, take their money and go.
