 Residents have deemed a newly pedestrianised zone in their town a ‘waste of money' and have criticised its ‘tacky' design. Wiggly white lines have been added to a new tarmac surface in Worthing, West Sussex as part of a £178,000 scheme to make its town centre car-free and ‘brighten up' the area. The move is part of the town council's promise to go carbon neutral by 2030, and offer an ‘attractive outdoor meeting space' for people in the town.
