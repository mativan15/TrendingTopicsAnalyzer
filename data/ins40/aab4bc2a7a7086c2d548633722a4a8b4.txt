On Monday morning, October 17, the rapper-turned podcaster called in to The Breakfast Club to formally apologize for airing his controversial interview with Ye. During the three-hour conversation, Ye continued to call out Jewish people (specifically those who work in the entertainment business) and repeated claims that the "Jewish media" is working against him.
