The hill temple of Lord Venkateswara here reeled under the impact of heavy turnout in pilgrim crowds on Saturday.Serpentine queue lines became the order of the day. The darshan lines stretched out to over three km on to the road outside the Vaikuntam Complex. The TTD, in a statement, said that the present arrangements hold good enough to provide darshan to about 4,500 pilgrims an hour. But going by the enormity of the teeming crowds, it may take around 48 hours for the pilgrims to get their turn for the darshan of the deity.
