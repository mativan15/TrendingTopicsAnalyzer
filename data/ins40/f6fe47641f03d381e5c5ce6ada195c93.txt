Elizabeth Debicki and Dominic West are speaking out about filming season five of "The Crown" and what it was like to recreate some of the royal family's most iconic moments from the 1990s.

Debicki and West took over the roles of Princess Diana and Prince Charles from Emma Corrin and Josh O'Connor respectively, who played the prince and princess in season four.

Season five picks up the story in 1992, the year the two announced their separation, and showcased the royals as they tried to carry on with their lives.
