Defensive end Joseph Adedire (43) is been an immediate contributor for the Red Raiders as a true freshman. He was a consensus state top-100 recruit last year.

Adesoji and Modinat Adedire came to America wanting to give their children the opportunity at a better life. The life of a high-profile football player might not have been what they had in mind originally, but that's how it's unfolded for Joseph Adedire.

The 6-foot-3, 270-pound defensive end from Mansfield Summit was a consensus top-100 recruit in the state of Texas last year with a tall stack of scholarship offers.
