Oct. 19—It's time to check in on Jack Hayes' chases of state records, also time to check in on preseason Class 4A-6A Calhoun County player-of-the-year Antonio Ross.

Two winner-take-all matchups this week will determine the four playoff seeds in Class 3A, Region 4, and Ohatchee's chances to make the playoffs in 3A, Region 6 have improved.

Oxford has clinched a playoff berth but still holds out hope for as high as a No. 2 seed.

Weaver, meanwhile, can double or even triple its win total from 2021.
