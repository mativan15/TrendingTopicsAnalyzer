A week before its provocative pages were exposed to the world 30 years ago, Madonna's scandalous 'Sex' book came to life at its infamous launch party in New York.
The BDSM-themed bash — which turned Industria Superstudio in the Meatpacking District into a den of debauchery — had everything from naked women suspended in the air by chains and lowered into big tubs of popcorn to people masturbating and having sex behind different doors. Meanwhile, Madonna presided over the whole affair as her dominatrix alter ego Dita wearing a Little Bo Peep costume that was more naughty than nursery.
