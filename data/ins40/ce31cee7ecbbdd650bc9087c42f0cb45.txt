 Vegas Pro 20 has received a major free update - and adopts one of the best tools in Adobe Premiere Pro. Two months after its initial launch, the video editing software is taking delivery of a raft of new features that aim to 'further enhance color grading workflow power, efficiencies and collaboration directly on the timeline,' according to Magix, the developer behind Vegas. Alongside the latest color correction tools comes a handful of subscriber-only features, including, and smarter integration between Vegas' desktop and mobile video editing apps.
