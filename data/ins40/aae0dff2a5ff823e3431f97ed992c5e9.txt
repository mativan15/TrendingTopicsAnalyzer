RANT to our economy. I just spent $15 for ONE sandwich. Yes, I was hungry and lazy. But, $15 for one sandwich (includes tip)?!? Heavens, when I started my first job in 1966 at 75 cents an hour (yeah, you read that right), today's sandwich meant 20 hours of work in 1966. My burger joint was selling hamburgers at 10 cents each. My sandwich today would have bought me 150 burgers! Heavens, yes, it's 55 years ago, but what has happened to our economy? Is that kind of price differential reasonable? It's no wonder that people are struggling!
