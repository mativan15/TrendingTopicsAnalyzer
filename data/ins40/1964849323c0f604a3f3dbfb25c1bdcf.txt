Last month, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) conducted searches across States and Union Territories as part of a pan-India operation, 'Megh Chakra'. The operation, against the online circulation and sharing of Child Sexual Abusive Material (CSAM) using cloud-based storage, was supposedly based on inputs received from Interpol's Singapore special unit, in turn based on the information received from New Zealand. In November 2021, a similar exercise code-named 'Operation Carbon' was launched by the CBI, with many being booked under the IT Act, 2000.
