 Honor's new Earbuds 3 Pro have plenty going for them. For one thing, they are the world's first coaxial dual-driver design with 11mm dynamic driver and piezoelectric ceramic tweeter (the individual driver units are built concentrically, tweeter inside driver). Then, there's the AirPods Pro-but-for-Android angle – let's face it, the design is a proven winner. Quick, iOS-style pairing to your Android phone? An open goal. And at €199 (around $178 / £238 / AU$367), with four different noise cancellation profiles, a separate ambient aware function, an intuitive app, simultaneous device pairing and boasting one more USP that Apple has been unable to achieve in any set of earbuds to date, they're stone cold winners, no? Except that the final promised (and much-hyped) world-first feature is nowhere to be seen.
