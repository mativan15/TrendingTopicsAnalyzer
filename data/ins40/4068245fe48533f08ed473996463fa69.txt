"We will reverse almost all the tax measures announced in the growth plan three weeks ago that have not started parliamentary legislation," the chancellor said in a broadcast statement. The British pound was up 1% at $1.1320 after the news, having started rising earlier Monday on a Sunday Times report of a coming cut to income tax.  The government has put an indefinite hold on plans to reduce the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 19%, and has scaled back the support for households and businesses facing steep rises in energy costs.
