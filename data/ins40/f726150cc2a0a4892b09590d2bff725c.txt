We believe that Wall Street's muted reaction to Johnson & Johnson 's (JNJ) better-than-expected quarter has more to do with the stock's outperformance this year compared to the broader market than anything that investors heard when the results were reported before the opening bell Tuesday. The Club stock and Dow component opened slightly higher and then drifted slightly lower in the afternoon. Reported sales for the third quarter increased 1.9% year over year to $23.79 billion, exceeding the $23.
