Women in Advertising

* 1968: Mary Wells became first female CEO of a company traded on the New York Stock Exchange

* "I ♥ New York" slogan was created by copywriter Jane Maas in the 1970's

* 1970: Barbara Proctor founded Proctor and Gardner Advertising, the first African-American woman to own an ad agency.
