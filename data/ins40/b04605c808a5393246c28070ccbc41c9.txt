(Bloomberg) -- The pound is coming off the first positive month of 2022, but the mood in the market is as bleak as ever. Scorching inflation, an economy teetering on the edge of recession and a scandal-prone government are feeding into a view that the UK currency is vulnerable. Even the language from strategists is miserable. Bank of America Corp. said investors should hedge for an 'existential' sterling crisis and the currency is facing struggles usually seen in emerging markets. 'Of all the major countries, the UK faces a much more difficult economic environment, a much more difficult policy choice, and a much more difficult political environment,' said Steven Barrow, head of FX strategy at Standard Advisory London.
