Chelsea make the short trip to Brentford in the Premier League tonight (kick-off, 7.30pm). The Blues will be looking to continue their excellent start under Graham Potter, who has yet to taste defeat in six matches since joining the club from Brighton.
Brentford have had an inconsistent season. After drawing their opening match away to Leicester City, each of their first two victories of the season was followed by a three-match winless streak, but their confidence will have been boosted by the 2-0 win at home to Brighton last Friday.
