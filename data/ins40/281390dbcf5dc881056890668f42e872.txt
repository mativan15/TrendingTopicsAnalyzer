By Reuters Published: 17:08 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 17:08 EDT, 2 June 2022 While the NFL continues to have an interest in the Australia market, it won't be sending down markers Down Under any time soon. An NFL representative on Thursday denied a report by The Australian newspaper that the league is planning to host a game in the country in 2024. "At this time we do not have plans to play a game in Australia but are firmly committed to finding more ways to serve our passionate and growing fanbase in Australia and New Zealand," NFL vice president of business development Damani Leech said, according to Sports Business Journal.
