Today, the tiny town of Money in the Mississippi Delta has a population below 100 – a quarter of the people who lived there in August 1955. That's when Emmett Till, a 14-year-old kid from Chicago who was visiting for the cotton harvest, made the innocent mistake of maybe, or maybe not, wolf-whistling at the white woman running a grocery. 
Emmett, nicknamed 'Bobo' to his friends and cousins down there, was not from the South; little did he know the grotesque dangers of any such interaction. His kidnapping from his uncle's farm a week later, in the middle of the night, is the last we see of him in Chinonye Chukwu's staunch, shattering Till, until his mother Mamie (Danielle Deadwyler) has to identify his body on a mortuary slab.
