Taking the occasional loss comes part and parcel with investing on the stock market. And there's no doubt that Domino's Pizza Enterprises Limited (ASX:DMP) stock has had a really bad year. The share price is down a hefty 56% in that time. On the bright side, the stock is actually up 16% in the last three years. Furthermore, it's down 17% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.

While the last year has been tough for Domino's Pizza Enterprises shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise.
