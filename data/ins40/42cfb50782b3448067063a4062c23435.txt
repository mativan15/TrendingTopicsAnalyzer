The toy store giant filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and closed all locations the following year as declining sales hit brick-and-mortar locations hard.

The brand's resurrection began three years later, however, when Macy's announced a partnership with Toys ‘R' Us parent company, WHP Global, in summer 2021, Fox Business reported.
