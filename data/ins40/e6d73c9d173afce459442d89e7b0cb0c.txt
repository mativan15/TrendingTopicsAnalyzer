WWE SmackDown started on a chaotic note as Karrion Kross and Scarlett had been involved in a car crash at the arena in New Orleans.
As Friday night's show went on air, viewers saw a pile up of cars, ambulances and more outside the venue as commentator Michael Cole talked viewers through the wild scenes.
Drew McIntyre took out Kross with another attack after their brutal Strap Match at Extreme Rules, keeping the feud going and effectively ruling his rival out of the main event.
We were told he was being examined by medical personnel during the show, and WWE boss Triple H was seen talking to police officers outside his office, while Kross was scheduled to face Ricochet, Solo Sikoa and Sheamus in the main event.
