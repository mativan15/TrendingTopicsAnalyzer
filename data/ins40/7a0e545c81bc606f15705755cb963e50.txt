The government has termed as 'ill informed' US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's remark that India has seen an increase in attacks on people and places of worship, and said "vote-bank politics" in international relations should be avoided. Blinken on Thursday released the US State Department 2021 Report on International Religious Freedom (IRF). The IRF is the US State Department's annual report to the Congress on international religious freedom, in which it gives its perspective on the status and violations of religious freedom across the globe.
