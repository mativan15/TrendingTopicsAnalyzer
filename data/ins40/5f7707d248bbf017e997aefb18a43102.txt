India's competition regulator CCI on Thursday passed an order levying a provisional penalty of Rs 1,337.7 crore on Google for abusing the dominant position of its Android mobile phone operating system. CCI also asked Google to implement a set of 10 remedial measures that will open up the mobile phone ecosystem. It's a milestone in curbing monopolistic behaviour in the digital economy. Its relevance comes from the scale of its impact in India and the global context too. Android has about 96% market share in India among mobile phones, which are the most popular access points to the internet.
