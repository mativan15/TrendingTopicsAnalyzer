00:00LET ME START OFF WITH THIS CHART WHICH SHOWS IT IS A MOMENTOUS DAY WHEN IT COMES TO THE START OF THE BALANCE SHEET RUNOFF. THIS CHART REALLY SHOWING THE NEW YORK FED PROJECTING AN AVERAGE OF $80 BILLION PER MONTH OF BALANCE SHEET RUNOFF THROUGH TO 2024. HOW WELL FLAGGED IS THIS IN THE SENSE OF INVESTOR MENTALITY AND HOW PRICED THIS IS ALREADY INTO THE MARKET OR DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE A SENSE THAT THEY WILL BE LOOKING FOR MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO SELL EVERY RALLY? > > I THINK IT HAS BEEN TELEGRAPHED VERY WELL.
