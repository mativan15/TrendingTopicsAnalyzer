Linebacker Andre Smith is eligible to return from a six-game suspension on Monday, but he won't be rejoining the Bills.

Ian Rapoport of NFL Media reports that the Bills are releasing Smith rather than adding him back to their active roster.

Smith was serving a suspension for violating the league's policy of performance-enhancing substances. He was a seventh-round pick by the Panthers in 2018 and came to the Bills in a 2020 trade.
