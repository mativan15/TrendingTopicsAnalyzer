krblokhin/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Many traders think U.S. Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:USEG) is a great way to trade very high oil and gas prices - until they look into the details. Prior hedging has greatly limited the benefits from current high energy prices. Some future oil production is hedged at only $49.99 and some natural gas at only $2.96. A large percent of its production was hedged in January when energy prices were much lower than current prices. Other than the hedges, the company has a very conservative balance sheet, even after acquiring three privately held oil and gas producers in January.
