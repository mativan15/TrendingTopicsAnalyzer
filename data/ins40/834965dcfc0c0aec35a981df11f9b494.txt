Organizations and nonprofits in Greater Akron can apply for a new round of grants made possible by a program sponsored by Gannett, owner of the Akron Beacon Journal.

The 2022 A Community Thrives program, a $2 million initiative created by the Gannett Foundation, will award grants to groups looking to improve communities across America.

Since the program's inception in 2017, over $17 million in grants have been donated through crowdfunding efforts that have been dispersed to more than 500 organizations across the country in markets where Gannett's USA TODAY Network operates.
