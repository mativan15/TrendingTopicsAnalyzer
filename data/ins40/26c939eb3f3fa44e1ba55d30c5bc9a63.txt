The Bihar chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Monday questioned the authority of deputy chief minister and health minister Tejashwi Yadav to suspend a professor-rank doctor, whose appointing authority is the chief minister, and said his suspension order was infructuous.Dr Binod Kumar Singh, medical superintendent of Patna's Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) was suspended last Friday for alleged lapses in administrative management of dengue patients at the hospital, without being given an opportunity to defend himself.
