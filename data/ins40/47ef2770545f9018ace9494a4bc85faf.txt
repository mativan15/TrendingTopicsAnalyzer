Doctor Strange 2 was already pretty dark… but Cumberbatch apparently suggested making it even darker. During an interview with Prestige, the Marvel star revealed that he wrote some of the scenes featuring Doctor Strange variants, and that he worked to make some of the scenes less "saccharine."'I suggested that it needed to get darker at a point,' he said. 'There was a slightly more saccharine version at one stage and I'm really happy with the way it evolved. Sam Raimi was so game for it and Michael Waldron really supported me to write it as well.
