The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected TMC leader Manik Bhattacharya's plea challenging his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money laundering case related to the primary teachers' appointment scam in West Bengal. The bench, of Justices Aniruddha Bose and Vikram Nath, had reserved its order regarding the matter on Tuesday (October 18).
Appearing for Bhattacharya, Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi had argued that the ED should not be allowed to arrest him as the court had earlier granted him protection from arrest by CBI, Live Law reported.
