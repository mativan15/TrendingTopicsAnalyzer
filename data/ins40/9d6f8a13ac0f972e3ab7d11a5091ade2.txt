Runaway healthcare and coverage prices are boosting historic inflation that's reducing Americans' purchasing power and living standards.

Last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced core inflation rose by 6.6 percent over the past year, the fastest rate in 40 years. Health insurance costs rose by 28.2 percent over the same period — more than four times this record rate. Economists predict healthcare prices will increase even more in the coming months. For instance, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimates the healthcare inflation rate will double between mid-2022 and mid-2023.
