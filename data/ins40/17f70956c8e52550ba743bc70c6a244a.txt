British Prime Minister Liz Truss has announced her resignation, just a month and a half after taking office.
Thursday's development came after her new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, rolled back virtually all of her economic agenda.
Hunt's move was supposed to be an impetus for growth, but it became Truss's declaration of political bankruptcy.
At the beginning of this month, at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Truss had still attempted to rally the party around her controversial approach of boosting Britain's economy.
