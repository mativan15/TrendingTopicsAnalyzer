Exxon Mobil Corp. completed its exit from Russia, calling the departure an 'expropriation' of its main Russian operation and potentially setting up a future legal challenge.

'With two decrees, the Russian government has unilaterally terminated our interests in Sakhalin-1 and the project has been transferred to a Russian operator,' an Exxon spokesperson said in a statement. 'We have safely exited Russia following the expropriation.'
