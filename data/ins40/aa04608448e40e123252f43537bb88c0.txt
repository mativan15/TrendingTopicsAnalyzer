Tapping into its strength in numbers, the European Union this month pushed through a major change for the global tech industry—having abandoned hopes of companies opting to change on their own. In early October, the EU Parliament in Brussels voted to impose a single, uniform charger for every smartphone, camera, and video game console either manufactured in the EU's 27 countries or sold to its 450 million residents. That means that tech companies will need to produce countless millions of items, including Google's Android phones and Apple's iPhones, with USB-C ports, or, by 2024, stop selling them in the world's biggest consumer market.
