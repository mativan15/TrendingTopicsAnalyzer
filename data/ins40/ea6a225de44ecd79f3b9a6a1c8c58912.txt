PHILADELPHIA, Pa. — The popular convenience store chain Wawa is shutting down two locations in the city because of 'safety and security challenges,' which is but another symptom of the crime epidemic that has propelled law-and-order issues to the top of voters' minds in this year's midterm elections.

Violent crime in Philadelphia has surged by 7% over last year, outpacing nationwide figures. The city reported 388 homicides so far this year, on a pace to eclipse last year's record body count. Property crimes are up by a staggering 30%, with commercial burglaries rising by 50%.
