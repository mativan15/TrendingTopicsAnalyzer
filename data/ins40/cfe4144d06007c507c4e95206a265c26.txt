Amazon (AMZN) workers at a warehouse near Albany, New York voted against joining the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), in a blow to a union that had a historic victory at JFK8 in Staten Island earlier this year.The final count was 406 against the union, and 206 for the union, with 31 challenged ballots. The warehouse, which is at Castleton-on-Hudson, represented the ALU's first attempt at organizing outside New York City, coming after its win in Staten Island."This isn't a surprising outcome — unions have long been reluctant to take on companies like Amazon because you're so unlikely to win," said John Logan, director of labor studies at San Francisco State University.
