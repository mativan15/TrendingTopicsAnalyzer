Justin Timberlake has paid a huge tribute to his wife Jessica Biel as the pair mark 10 years of marriage. The Mirrors singer, 41, gushed over his 40-year-old wife and insisted "10 years ain't enough" as he uploaded a number of sweet snaps of the pair. Writing to his 66.7 million followers on Instagram on Wednesday, the former N*Sync man said: "You make me a better husband and father every day! I love you so much you beautiful human! Run it back!" Among the uploads was a cute video in which the power couple gave the characters from Lady and the Tramp a run for their money by slurping on a single spaghetti noodle.
