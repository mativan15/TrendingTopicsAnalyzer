SAN FRANCISCO —  Jordan Poole cemented himself as a cornerstone of the Warriors' future last season with his breakout third-year campaign, earning himself a four-year contract extension this offseason that could earn him up to $140 million.
Poole was the team's leading scorer the final month of last season when Stephen Curry was sidelined with a foot injury. Poole averaged 24.7 points, making an average of four 3-pointers per game while shooting 41.9% from deep, in the last 21 games of the regular season.
