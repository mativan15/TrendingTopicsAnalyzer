A winning Lotto Max ticket worth $1 million is just days away from expiring and if that happens the winner will forfeit the prize. One lucky player, who bought the ticket in Toronto, won the Maxmillions prize in the June 15, 2021 Lotto Max draw, but the money was never claimed, the OLG said in a news release issued Wednesday. The winning Maxmillions numbers for that draw were 01 – 18 – 22 – 31 – 32 – 40 – 43. The OLG said the winning ticket must match all seven numbers to win the Maxmillions prize.
