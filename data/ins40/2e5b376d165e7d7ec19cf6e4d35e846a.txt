Apple is taking a big gamble with the iPhone 14 which I predict will anger a lot of users. But now we know why...

TrendForce reports that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max will receive a 50% increase in RAM compared to the 2021 iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini: iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini: 4GB (LPDDR4X) iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Max: 6GB (LPDDR4X) This increased RAM is what Apple used in iPhone 13 Pro models, which means Apple can market the iPhone 14 has having 'Pro-level performance' at a more affordable price.
