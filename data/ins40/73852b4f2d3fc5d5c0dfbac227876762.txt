SAN DIEGO -- The Padres have advanced deeper into the postseason than all but two teams in franchise history. They have done so with nary a home run from Juan Soto.
That's quite a contrast from Soto's first foray into the spotlight of October baseball. As the 2019 postseason straddled his 21st birthday, Soto drilled five homers and slugged .554 in leading the underdog Nationals to a World Series championship.
Fast forward three years, and Soto is in a postseason of another kind. He's no longer the precocious kid surrounded by a veteran lineup.
