The four ladies of Four More Shots are back, but their entry has not been that glamorous this time. It continues with the story of Damini (played by Sayani Gupta), Anjana (played by Kirti Kulhari), Umang (played by Bani J) and Riddhi (played by Maanvi Gaagroo). The show's first three episodes have proven that the writers may have decided to deviate a little from the sex stories. It might also be because all three girls are single. The episode opens with a cringe-worthy dialogue that roughly translates to: "outside, a traffic jam, and inside, a family jam".
