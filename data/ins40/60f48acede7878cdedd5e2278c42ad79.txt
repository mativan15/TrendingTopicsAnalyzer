Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland issued a warning to Canadians Wednesday — the coming months won't be pretty as rising interest rates slow a once red-hot economy and force some people out of their jobs.The Bank of Canada's recent rate hikes to tame sky-high inflation will increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers alike, which will send shockwaves throughout the economy, Freeland said.Speaking at an auto industry conference in Windsor, Ont., Freeland said she would be honest with Canadians about the roadblocks that lie ahead and the threat of higher unemployment and mortgage rates — developments that could hurt many households.
