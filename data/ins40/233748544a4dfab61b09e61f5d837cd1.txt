Luna 2.0, a Frankenstein cryptocurrency resurrected after its predecessor crashed to near-worthlessness, is already looking pretty haggard out of the starting gate. And like Mary Shelley's monster, there are signs of more misfortune in the near future.Luna 2.0, which launched Saturday to replace the old Luna and Terra cryptocurrency ecosystem (now rebranded as Luna and Terra 'Classic'), started at a high of $19.53 but then sank to a low of just over $4 over the next few hours, according to CNBC. The price hovered just below $6 before jumping up to around $9.
