The company's stock dropped as much as 9.5% to the lowest since May 2020 before paring some of the loss. It was one of the biggest drags on the benchmark Kospi on Monday, along with affiliates Kakaopay Corp. and KakaoBank Corp.

The blaze halted messaging, payment, gaming and other popular services for hours on Saturday.
