In southern Texas, where the Rio Grande Valley hugs the Mexican border, people are already experiencing what it's like to live in a post-Roe world.In September 2021, Texas passed the SB8 law which banned abortions after 6 weeks of pregnancy and penalized anyone who helps a person get an abortion.With a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court, the court is expected to rule on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization this month, a decision that could end Americans' constitutional right to get an abortion.
