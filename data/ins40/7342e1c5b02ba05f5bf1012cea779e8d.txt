By Paul Burton October 16, 2022 / 10:03 PM / CBS Boston SALEM -- Salem is enjoying one of its busiest Halloween seasons ever. The city was crowded with tens of thousands of visitors all weekend long and for most of it, there wasn't any parking available. "This is our first time coming and we are amazed by it, so much fun," said Jackie, who visited from Rhode Island with Darlene. They parked in one of the satellite lots. "It was great, very convenient," said Darlene.   "We came dressed. We came to play," Jackie said.
