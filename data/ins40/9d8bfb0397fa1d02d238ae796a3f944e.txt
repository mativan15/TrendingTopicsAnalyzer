By Josh Beckerman The New York Stock Exchange suspended Revlon Inc. shares, which had higher prices after the company's June bankruptcy filing amid strong interest from individual investors. Shares were down 5% at $3.90 before they were halted at about 2:44 p.m. EDT due to news pending. Revlon said its appeal was rejected, while the NYSE said its Committee for Review of the Board of Directors of the Exchange upheld the previously announced determination to delist Revlon. Revlon expects its stock to trade on the OTC Marketplace/Pink Sheets following the NYSE delisting process.
