The musical version of filmmaker Mira Nair's 2001 hit comedy-drama Monsoon Wedding will premiere in Doha on November 15, the organisers have announced. Titled Monsoon Wedding Musical, it is part of Qatar Creates' cultural programme for the upcoming FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022."'Monsoon Wedding' is a story that inspires debate about the nature of life, identity and our place within an ever-changing world," said Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar Creates Events, which is presenting the show.
