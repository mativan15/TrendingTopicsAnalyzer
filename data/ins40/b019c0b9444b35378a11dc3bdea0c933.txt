When James Flanagan was two years old, he and his mother were homeless. By the age of 15, he had dropped out of secondary school in Dublin's north inner city before he had completed the Junior Cert.He was, he says, at risk of falling through the same cracks as other young men in his neighbourhood whose lives were blighted by drugs, prison or worse.Today, the 18-year-old works as a technician for an engineering company at the Intel campus in Leixlip, Co Kildare. He is, he believes, the youngest supervisor on the site, responsible for the safety of men twice his age.
