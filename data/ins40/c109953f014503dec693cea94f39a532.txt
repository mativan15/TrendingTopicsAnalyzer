A couple in Campbell River, B.C., has launched a court action against the provincial government after it refused to register their infant's name due to its Kwak'wala lettering.
Crystal Smith and Raymond Shaw say they won't register nine-month-old λugʷaləs K'ala'ask Shaw until B.C.'s Vital Statistics Agency can accept his name as written.That agency is now named in a petition to the court alleging the refusal violates their freedom of expression rights, and constitutional protection from discrimination.
