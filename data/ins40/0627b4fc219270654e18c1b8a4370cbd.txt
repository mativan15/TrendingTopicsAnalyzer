It was a breezy three-kilometer ride on VanMoof's A5 e-bike around Battersea Park in London. Starting from VanMoof's flagship London store, the company's CEO, Ties Carlier, took the lead. He shot off on the more typically framed S5 ($3,498), while I got to grips with the boost and controls on the VanMoof's new, shorter A5 (also $3,498). A few seconds later, I caught up. I hadn't broken a sweat. My brief test ride around the neighborhood was almost too easy.
I had briefly ridden VanMoof's e-bikes before, but its latest generation of e-bikes usher in changes across the board.
