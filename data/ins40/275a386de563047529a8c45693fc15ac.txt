Bucks County "Hoax mom" Bonnie Sweeten, who gained infamy in 2009 when she faked a kidnapping after stealing $700,000 from her employer and family is facing new charges that she embezzled from another Bucks County business.

Bonnie Sweeten, 51, of Delanco, New Jersey, was charged in the U.S Eastern District Court in Philadelphia on Monday with two counts of wire fraud for stealing from her former employer, according to a press release.

Federal authorities allege Sweeten, who worked as a bookkeeper, forged checks and made fraudulent purchases with a company credit card, according to a press release, which did not list a total amount of money she is accused of stealing.
