Published: 04:39 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 04:44 EDT, 2 June 2022 Sam Ryder's ascent continued on Thursday as the increasingly popular singer attended an early morning rehearsal ahead of his performance at The Queen's star-studded Platinum Jubilee celebrations. The former Essex café owner, 32, has become a household name after ending years of British mediocrity at the Eurovision Song Contest in May, where he finished in an impressive second place behind eventual winners Ukraine.   The unlikely triumph has since assured him a place onstage at Buckingham Palace on Saturday, when thousands will gather on the Mall and millions across the country will honour The Queen's 70th year as head of the British monarchy.
