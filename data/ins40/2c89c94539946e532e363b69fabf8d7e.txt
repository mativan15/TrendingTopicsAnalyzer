magicmine/iStock via Getty Images Amneal Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:AMRX) on Wednesday launched its oral Lyvispah granules for the treatment of abnormal muscle tightness, known as spasticity, caused due to spinal cord and neurological disorders. FDA-approved Lyvispah is bioequivalent to oral baclofen tablets and comes in three doses of 5mg, 10mg and 20mg packets of granules. Baclofen is a well established skeletal muscle relaxant used for the treatment of spasticity and spinal cord injuries. 'This is the first Specialty product launch for the business since Rytary (carbidopa and levodopa) in 2015, and the first in a cadence of new branded launches planned over the next several years," said AMRX co-CEOs Chirag Patel and Chintu Patel.
