In 2013, Israeli guitarist Ori Naftaly entered the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, Tennessee.

'There is a reason why I was excited about Memphis,' says Naftaly.

'It is the birthplace of rock ‘n' roll, blues, everything that is cool..'

Naftaly‘s love of Memphis and its status as the birthplace of soul music began in his home country of Israel where he grew up listening to his Dad's worn-out cassette tapes of the artists from the Memphis-based record label Stax Records.

Now a successful guitarist in the Memphis-based group Southern Avenue, Naftaly is living his childhood dream.
