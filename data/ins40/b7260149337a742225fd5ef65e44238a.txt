The Brazilian digital banking startup Nubank will launch its own cryptocurrency in the country next year, marking the latest move into digital assets by a large financial institution.

Nubank said Wednesday it will launch the token, called Nucoin, in the first half of 2023. In a press release, the company touts Nucoin as "a new way to recognize customer loyalty and encourage engagement with Nubank products." Nubank said it plans to offer discounts and other perks to holders of the token.

"The project is another step ahead in our belief in the transformative potential of blockchain technology and to democratize it even more, going beyond the purchase, sale and maintenance of cryptocurrencies in the Nu app," Fernando Czapski, general manager for Nucoin at Nubank, said in a statement.
