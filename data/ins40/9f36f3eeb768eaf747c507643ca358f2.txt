Sea Slug is the latest star to be eliminated from The Masked Dancer, and fans were blown away to find out it was Denise Lewis behind the mask. 
Most of the panel managed to work out it was gold medallist Denise under the mask, with Oti Mabuse realising her identity after a voice clue was revealed and Denise said the word ‘goddess'. 
Clues pointing towards her sporting success included a scroll with the names of the Golden Girls – hinting at her gold medals – as well as a big Greek vase and Olympic rings in the background, in an ode to her gold medal in the heptathlon at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
