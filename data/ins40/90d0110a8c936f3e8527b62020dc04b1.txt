There are simply no other words to describe it: the country is being gaslit by the proponents of Project Fear. We are told that Remainers have been vindicated; that the Truss 'experiment' is a cautionary tale in the dangers of ideological extremism; that her foolhardy mistakes trace back to the hubris that Brexit unleashed. Apparently, it is now up to 'grown-ups' like Jeremy Hunt to take back the reins from libertarian 'jihadis' and pursue sensible economics anchored in sound money.
Since there is now a dangerous power vacuum in Downing Street, such a bold attempt to rewrite history is unsurprising.
