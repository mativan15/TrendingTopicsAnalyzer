A Los Angeles city councilman said he will not resign amid calls by a long list of California leaders for him and a colleague to step down after a leaked audio recording caught him and other Latino officials making racist remarks and berating their colleagues and constituents. Kevin de León and Gil Cedillo have so far resisted calls to step down, even after former Council President Nury Martinez resigned last week. In an interview with Univision, de León said he intends to keep his council seat. "I won't resign because there is still a lot of work to be done," he said in a Spanish-language interview that aired Wednesday.
