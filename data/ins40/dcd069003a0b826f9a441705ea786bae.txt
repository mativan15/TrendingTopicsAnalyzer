Amazon is dropping some early Black Friday deals on some of our favorite tech, like LG's brilliant 2022 C2 OLED TV, which is on sale for a record-low price of $1,346.99 (was $1,799.99) (opens in new tab). That's a $453 discount and one of the best early Black Friday deals we've seen on a premium display.

The LG C2 OLED is ranked as TechRadar's best TV of 2022, and for a good reason. It has everything you'd want in your dream TV, including a stunning OLED display powered by LG's latest a9 Gen5 AI processor, which delivers deep contrast and excellent brightness.
