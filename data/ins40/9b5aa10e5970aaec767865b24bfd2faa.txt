India's goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy, with a contribution of $3 trillion and over $1 trillion from the services and manufacturing sector respectively, requires accelerated investments. According to Morgan Stanley, India is likely to be the fastest-growing Asian economy in 2022-23 and is expected to grow at an average of 7% during this period contributing 28% to Asian and 22% to global growth. A substantive part of this growth will stem from robust domestic demand, induced by economic policy reforms, a young workforce and business investments facilitated by rationalised corporate taxes along with incentivising domestic production, which will augment investment attractiveness leading to infrastructure growth.
