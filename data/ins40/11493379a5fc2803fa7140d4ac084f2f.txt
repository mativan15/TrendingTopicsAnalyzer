It's no secret that the Tennessee Titans' wide receivers room isn't exactly a group of world-beaters at the moment.

This unit could use all the help it can get, especially with the recent loss of rookie wideout Treylon Burks, who is out at least three more games due to a turf toe injury.

Naturally, any competent receiver that's rumored to be on the trading block is going to intrigue a large portion of this fanbase.

That's exactly what happened when a ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported that multiple teams have been inquiring about the availability of New England Patriots wide receiver Kendrick Bourne.
