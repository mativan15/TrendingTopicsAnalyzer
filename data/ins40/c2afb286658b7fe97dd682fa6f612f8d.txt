From consumer behaviors to forthcoming trends, data can be a goldmine of useful information for guiding business decisions. But what is there to be found when we mine the data of a song? According to AI-based music technology company HITLAB, machine learning is revolutionizing the music industry. 'When we created our algorithm, everyone in the music industry thought we were crazy, too ahead of our time, or simply trying to get rid of the A&R's' said HITLAB's president and CEO, Michel Zgarka, who holds over 35 years of experience in the media and entertainment industry.
