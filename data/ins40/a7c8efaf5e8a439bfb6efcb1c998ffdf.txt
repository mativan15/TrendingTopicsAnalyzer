Amazon (AMZN) has moved into a new business area, entering the UK insurance comparison market, with an initial focus on home policies.

The online portal, which launched on Wednesday, allows its users to shop for home insurance using third party providers. It currently has three insurers on board, but plans to add more next year.

It will initially provide shoppers with quotes from Co-op, LV= General Insurance and Ageas UK.
