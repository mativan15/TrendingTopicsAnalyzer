Alleging that the Union government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was attempting to make 'Hindi the language that symbolises power', Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Tuesday tabled a resolution in the state assembly against any 'imposition' of the language. The opposition AIADMK, led by former chief minister Edapaddi K Palaniswami, and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs staged a walkout ahead of assembly proceedings. 'I am moving a historic resolution on the floor of the House, continuing with the tradition of voicing our opinion against imposition of a dominant language,' Stalin said in his speech.
