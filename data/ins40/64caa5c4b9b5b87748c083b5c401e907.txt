Wealthy Californians are facing the prospect of billions in new taxes, adding to one of the highest US tax burdens in a state that's already been losing thousands of people every month to lower-cost locales.

Voters in November will decide whether to levy an additional 1.75% tax on income above $2 million to raise money for electric vehicles and wildfire prevention -- a measure that has divided Democrats and drawn opposition from billionaire donors and Governor Gavin Newsom. More locally, Los Angelenos will decide whether to increase taxes on the sale of mansions, while San Francisco is considering fees on second homes used by part-time residents.
