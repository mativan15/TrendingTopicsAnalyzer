LaLiga president Javier Tebas has accused Paris Saint-Germain of ‘cheating' to secure a new deal for Kylian Mbappe.Last month, the Ligue 1 champions confirmed they had reached an agreement with the 23-year-old France forward to keep him at the club until 2023.Mbappe had been linked with a move to Real Madrid for more than a year, but his decision to snub the Spanish champions has left LaLiga chief Tebas furious.And now he has claimed PSG broke Financial Fair Play rules in order to keep the World Cup winner, leading him to file a complaint.
