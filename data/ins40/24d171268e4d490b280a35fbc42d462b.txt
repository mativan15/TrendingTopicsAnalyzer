Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is expected to speak about the fast-tracking of projects through planning laws, at the weekly post-Cabinet press conference. Ardern will be speaking at 4pm. The press conference will be live-streamed above. It comes after an eventful weekend, with NZ First accusing Labour of failing to deliver its 'hallucinogenic objectives', during the party's annual conference. The Government also faces pressure elsewhere, as more than 30 bars and restaurants shut their doors to customers in Rotorua in protest of immigration policies and staffing concerns.
