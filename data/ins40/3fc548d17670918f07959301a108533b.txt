ONLINE fashion giant Misguided is on the brink of calling in administrators as the business is close to toppling.
The clothes company has been accused of not paying suppliers and is facing collapse.

A winding up petition was issued against Missguided on May 10 by supplier JSK Fashions, according to Retail Gazette.
And factory owners are millions of pounds out of pocket and face collapsing too.
Teneo is understood to be on stand by should the company be unable to find a buyer to save it from going under.
