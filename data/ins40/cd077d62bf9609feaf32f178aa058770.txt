Daniel Garcia always knew he wanted to go to college. It was an idea in the back of his mind throughout high school, but not one he was confident he'd be able to put into action.'I wasn't sure college was something that was possible for me. My parents are from Trinidad and Tobago and like so many immigrants, my parents didn't have access to higher education,' he said. 'I wasn't sure whether or not college would be something that was financially feasible for my family.'To make the situation more complex, Garcia didn't have anybody who could help him through the college admissions process.
