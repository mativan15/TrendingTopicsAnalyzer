A group of technology experts is trying to warn the government of the dangers of the crypto industry. In a letter to U.S. policy makers, 26 computer scientists and engineers called on lawmakers to block efforts to create a ‘regulatory safe haven' for cryptocurrency. They want leaders in Washington to instead focus on what they're calling ‘responsible fintech policy.''The claims that the blockchain advocates make are not true,' Harvard professor Bruce Schneier, a member of the group behind the recent warning against crypto, told the Financial Times.
