Weapons being sent to Ukraine to aid its army's defence against the Russian invasion could end up in the hands of criminals, the head of Interpol has said.Jürgen Stock said that the international market could be flooded by guns once the conflict ends.'Once the guns fall silent [in Ukraine], the illegal weapons will come. We know this from many other theatres of conflict. The criminals are even now, as we speak, focusing on them,' he said.'Criminal groups try to exploit these chaotic situations and the availability of weapons, even those used by the military and including heavy weapons.
