Chancellor Jeremy Hunt ending the government's Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) from April has left families ‘terrified', anti-poverty groups warn.
Prime minister Liz Truss in September said ordinary households will pay no more than £2,500 for gas and electricity annually for the next two years. 
But don't expect to be paying that for long, Hunt told Brits today.
Hunt said the support would be reviewed so it cost ‘significantly less than planned' and won't run for all households from April 2023.
He said the vulnerable would continue to be shielded from soaring wholesale energy prices but provided no details of what this would look like.
