Chennai Tamil Nadu News Live: The Tamil Nadu government on Wednesday sought the Centre's intervention to release a special emergency credit line guarantee scheme to the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) engaged in the garment business, as the sector was undergoing ‘severe crisis'. MSMEs in Tiruppur constitute 95 per cent of the exporting clusters and orders for the summer season declined by around 40 per cent compared to last year, Chief Minister M K Stalin said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
