NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Nashville Mayor John Cooper says his office is asking the Tennessee Supreme Court to reconsider its decision that a contentious school voucher program does not violate a key section of the state's constitution.Last month, Tennessee's highest court ruled that Gov. Bill Lee's 2019 voucher initiative doesn't violate the state constitution's 'home rule,' which says the Legislature can't pass measures singling out individual counties without local support.The program would only apply to Nashville and Shelby County, which includes Memphis, the areas with the lowest performing schools and regions with Democratic political strongholds who opposed the measure.
