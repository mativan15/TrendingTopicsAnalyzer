Kreuger said, "I've considered investing the money, but if I spend it, it's going to be on equipment and a space I can use to train content creators and inspire people who are where I was five years ago."
Two runners-up were each awarded $2,500. Thomas Vo, 17, of Irving, Texas, presented his business Reheats, which makes electric heated gloves for construction workers and others working in the cold. Abhinav Gorrepati, 14, of San Jose, California, presented CredX, an online educational platform that encourages financial literacy in teens through engaging lessons.
