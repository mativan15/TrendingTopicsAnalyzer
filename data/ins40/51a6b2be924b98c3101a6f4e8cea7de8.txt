Dominic West has confirmed that the upcoming series of The Crown will actually feature ‘tampon-gate', as the story of then-Prince Charles' divorce from Princess Diana continues.
The hotly anticipated series will return next month and will see West take on the role of King Charles III, Elizabeth Debicki as Princess Diana, and Imelda Staunton as Queen Elizabeth II.  
We already know that the new series will feature Princess Diana's infamous Panorama interview of 1995, and another scandalous moment has also been confirmed.
