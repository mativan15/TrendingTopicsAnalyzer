Transport secretary Grant Shapps has rejected calls for relaxation of immigration rules to resolve staffing shortages which have caused chaos in Britain's airports over the half-term week.Mr Shapps denied that Brexit was to blame for lengthy queues and cancelled flights, insisting that problems were caused by the aviation industry's inadequate planning for the return of travel following the Covid pandemic.He said that part of the solution would be to increase pay of airport workers, to attract more homegrown staff into the industry.
