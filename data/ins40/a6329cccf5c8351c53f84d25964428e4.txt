Experts at boiler provider BOXT have urged Britons to get their boiler regularly serviced to avoid spending thousands of pounds extra on energy bills. Not getting a boiler checked will reduce its lifespan and they are expensive to repair, costing on average between £1,500 and £3,500.A regular service helps spot early warning signs of damage and can help prevent bigger issues developing, maximising the boiler's lifespan to between 10 to 15 years.Not servicing a boiler means it can't run at maximum efficiency meaning the household's energy consumption could increase.
