A 46-year-old California man accused of plotting to blow up the state's Democratic Party headquarters in a bid to avenge ex-President Donald Trump's electoral loss pleaded guilty on Friday to three charges, federal prosecutors announced. Ian Benjamin Rogers of Napa will be sentenced in September for conspiring to destroy a building by fire or explosives, possessing an explosive device, and possessing a machine gun. Rogers and co-conspirator Jarrod Copeland, 38, 'hoped their attacks would prompt a movement,' prosecutors said.
