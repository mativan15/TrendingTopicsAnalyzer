BOISE, Idaho — In the days since Dane Partridge was fatally wounded while serving as a volunteer soldier in Ukraine, his sister has found moments of comfort in surprising places: First, a misplaced baseball cap discovered in her laundry room, then in a photo of a battered pickup truck with only one tire intact.

The 34-year-old Idaho man died Tuesday from injuries sustained during during a Russian attack in Luhansk.

A former U.S. Army infantryman, Partridge felt 'spiritually called' to volunteer with the Ukranian military as they defend the country from invading Russian forces, his sister Jenny Corry said.
