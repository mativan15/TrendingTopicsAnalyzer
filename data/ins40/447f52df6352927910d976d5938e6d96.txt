At Rs 6,15,518.97 crore total outlay, the Uttar Pradesh Assembly just saw its biggest budget, as well as fireworks between the ruling BJP and the opposition Samajwadi Party benches. But, behind the scenes, young and old, across parties, bonded over another development in the House: the Assembly going ‘paperless'.
Last week, the UP Assembly became only the second in the country to come on board NeVA (National e-Vidhan Application), whereby all Assemblies will come on a single digital platform. The country's largest House took its first step towards going paperless with last year's Budget, but now, tablets have been installed on the desks of all the 403 MLAs putting questions, answers, archival materials, speeches and other documents at the tip of their fingers.
