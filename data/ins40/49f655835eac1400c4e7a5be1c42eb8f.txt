The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is attempting to ascertain the antecedents of an individual called Manish Patel, who transferred 75,000 British pounds to a foreign bank account of the elder brother of a computer hacker accused of multiple crimes in Bengaluru.
In the course of a hearing of a petition filed in the Karnataka High Court by Sudarshan Ramesh, the elder brother of hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki, the ED informed the HC on Friday that the hacker's brother had not provided details of Patel, who transferred 75,000 British pounds to his account, and the reason for transfers.
