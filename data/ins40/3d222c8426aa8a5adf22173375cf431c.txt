TAURUS (Apr 21-May20)Dear Taurus, you may avoid any new financial transaction as you may not be confident for the same. Finances may be smooth otherwise and there may not be any shortage of money. There may not be any obstruction in your regular income. Some disturbance in the family life is foreseen, so it may be good if you are little cautious with your relations. In the past, you may have taken relations for granted but it may be good if you do not do this today. Try to be caring with all family members as they may need your support and love.
