The owner of a downtown Vancouver barber shop is frustrated after being woken up at 5 a.m. Sunday by the news that the window of his business was smashed for the fourth time in two years. Angelo Khoshaba says he got a text after the alarm went off and soon after watched the surveillance video on his phone. "The guy came on a bicycle, looked around a couple of times and he stopped by here. He had something in his hand, he threw it at the window, smashed the window. He walked around like he was waiting for things to clear," he tells CTV News.
