Rome CNN —

Giorgia Meloni, the hard-right leader who is due to be sworn in as Italy's first female prime minister, won the election on a campaign built around a promise to block migrant ships and support for traditional 'family values' and anti-LGBTQ themes.

She heads an alliance of far-right and center-right parties, her own Brothers of Italy chief among them, and is set to form the most right-wing government Italy has seen in decades.

Meloni's win in parliamentary elections last month suggests the allure of nationalism remains undimmed in Italy – but her vow to take the country on a hard-right turn still leaves many uncertain what will happen next.
