CappuchinoBy CappuchinoOct 18, 2022One thing about partnerships is that you really have to pay attention to your deal to make sure you aren't getting screwed. Jay-Z is known to have partnerships with people but now he is about to sue one company. He has his D'Usse cognac with Barcardi and they struck their partnership back in 2011. However, Jay wants to know how the brand is doing and how much money it's making. TMZ Hip Hop reports Jay-Z's company, SC Liquor, is demanding total financial clarity from Bacardi when it comes to D'Usse.
