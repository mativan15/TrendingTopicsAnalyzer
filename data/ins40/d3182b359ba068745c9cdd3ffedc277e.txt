In 2021, I finally made the decision to become a financially responsible adult by investing and saving for my future. I'm a big fan of learning from people who know more than me about different topics, so I turned to personal finance YouTubers. Many of the YouTubers I watched are millionaires, so I assumed they knew what they were talking about.
