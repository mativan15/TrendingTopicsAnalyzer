Priory Avenue is a mature sleepy road that runs parallel to the Stillorgan dual carriageway, which makes it convenient to the surrounding areas of Blackrock, Mount Merrion and Stillorgan, in addition to many schools and University College Dublin in Belfield.Set well back behind mature planting, Number 17 was built in the 1940s by Sisk Construction for one of its company directors. Today it is home to Philip and Nicola Flynn who purchased the house in 1998 after returning to Ireland from the United States where Philip worked in the tech industry.
