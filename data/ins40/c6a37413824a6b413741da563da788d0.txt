The Canadian dollar CADUSD strengthened to its highest level in nearly six weeks against its broadly stronger U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, as oil prices rose and investors awaited a Bank of Canada interest rate decision.Canada's central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates by half a percentage point for a second straight meeting.The policy decision, due at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT), follows Canadian GDP data on Tuesday that showed buoyant domestic demand.'The economy clearly retains some solid underlying momentum and policymakers have made clear that well above-target inflation is their primary focus,' strategists at Scotiabank, including Shaun Osborne, said in a note.
