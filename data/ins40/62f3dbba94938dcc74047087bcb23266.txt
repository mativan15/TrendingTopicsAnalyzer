May 29—The price of electricity is going up everywhere, but one state utility regulator thinks it's still worth the effort to shop around.

"I think there are competitive rates out there that people can shop for," said Barbara Bossart, chief of the reliability and service analysis division at the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, Ohio's regulator of electric and other utilities.
