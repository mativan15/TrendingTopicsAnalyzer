Gov. Kathy Hochul is sharing some good news with property taxpayers, but the timing of her announcement has critics wondering whether she's leveraging her official power for personal political gain ahead of the June 28 Democratic primary.
'Governor Hochul and the New York State Legislature are providing you this Homeowner Tax Rebate check that you can use to help pay your property taxes,' reads the letter accompanying a check shared with The Post. 
The tax rebates are also coming much earlier than in past years.
