As historic prices at the pumps hurt budgets and change summer plans, the British Columbia Automobile Association (BCAA) says there are ways to save when you drive, through a practice called "hypermiling." 'Hypermiling is the practice of trying to get every mile or kilometre out of a gas of tank,' says BCAA automotive specialist Josh Smythe. 'Trying to get as much out of it as you can in order to be cost-effective.' Since the price of gasoline topped $2 per litre on Vancouver Island in March, drivers have been especially looking for relief.
