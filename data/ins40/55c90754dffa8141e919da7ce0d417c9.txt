The month of October, celebrated as 'Uptober' by long-time crypto investors, has historically churned out some big gains for bitcoin. In seven of the last 10 years, bitcoin has posted a positive month. Most recently, it notched a 40% gain 2021 in, after posting 28% and 10% increases in 2020 and 2019, respectively. That's according to spot exchange closing prices tracked by data provider CryptoQuant. For four of the last six years, ether has ended the October trading month higher, according to Kaiko.
