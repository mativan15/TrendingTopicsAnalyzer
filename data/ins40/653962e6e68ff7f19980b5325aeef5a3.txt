Abbott Laboratories has initiated a voluntary recall of certain lots of ready-to-feed liquid products for infants and children, including the brands Similac and Pedialyte Electrolyte Solution, due to faulty bottle caps, per a notice from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Per the official recall, which was first announced on Oct. 14, less than 1% of the bottles in question may contain the defective caps. These bottles "may not have sealed completely, which could result in spoilage," the company said in a statement, adding that spoiled products, if consumed, can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
