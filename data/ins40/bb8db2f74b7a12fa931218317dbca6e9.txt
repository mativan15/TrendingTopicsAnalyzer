He's reportedly set for surgery that will keep him out for a chunk of the season.

The Ravens began the season without JK Dobbins, as he finished up his recovery from the torn ACL that cost him the entire 2021 season. After four games back, the explosive running back will be sidelined once again, after going under the knife for another knee surgery.

ESPN's Adam Schefter reports that Dobbins is 'expected to undergo arthroscopic knee surgery next week' which will keep him out for 4–6 weeks. The report coincides with the Ravens announcing that Dobbins is out for Sunday after sitting out the full week of practice with a knee injury.
