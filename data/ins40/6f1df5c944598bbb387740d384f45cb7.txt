I'm a Tory MP, but I think Thérèse Coffey is putting ideology above the nation's health

I am proud to have been the minister for child health in the coalition government that introduced new laws to ban smoking in cars with children. This was an important public health law that prevented children from developing cancer, asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia and a whole host of other chronic breathing problems which can be caused by inhaling secondhand cigarette and cigar smoke. Putting it simply, banning smoking in cars with children has saved lives. I only wish that the new secretary of state for health held the same view.
