 Charles River Laboratories International (NYSE:CRL) and Nanoscope Therapeutics are collaborating for manufacturing gene therapies for vision disorders.
Charles River will manufacture both plasmid DNA and viral vectors for late stage trials targeting degenerative ocular diseases with no known cure, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.
Nanoscope will have access to manufacturing platforms and multiple Charles River CDMO centers of excellence, the company added.
Nanoscope's optogenetic therapy uses a proprietary AAV2 vector to deliver Multi-Characteristic Opsin (MCO) genes into retinal cells to enable vision, CRL noted.
