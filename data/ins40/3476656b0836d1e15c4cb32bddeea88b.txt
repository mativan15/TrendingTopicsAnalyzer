During the ninth episode of the Game of Thrones prequel, Alicent (Olivia Cooke) appears to reward Larys (Matthew Needham) for his information by removing her shoes and stockings and allowing him to pleasure himself over the sight of her bare feet.

The scene left viewers stunned, with fans saying the character's foot fetish 'wasn't on' their House of the Dragon 'bingo card'.
