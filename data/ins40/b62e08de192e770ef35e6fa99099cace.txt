But the justices refused to take up an appeal from people born in American Samoa, and living in Utah, who argued that a federal law declaring that they are 'nationals, but not citizens, of the United States at birth' is unconstitutional.

A trial judge in Utah ruled in their favor, but the federal appeals court in Denver said Congress, not courts, should decide the citizenship issue. The appeals court also noted that American Samoa's elected leaders opposed the lawsuit for fear that it might disrupt their cultural traditions.
