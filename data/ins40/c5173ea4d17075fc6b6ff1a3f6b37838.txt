I might live rurally, but the last thing I wants is to feel is disconnected

Once, people moved to the countryside to escape. Wild cliffs, wide valleys and mountains were places you went to lose yourself. People ran to the hills to be isolated. I suppose that's why I first came to the countryside. It seemed like a way to free myself from everything and everyone (not to mention a marriage). But if I came to the countryside harbouring fantasies of ­living alone on a cliff, now that I've actually settled here it turns out the last thing I want is to be isolated. What's the point in having all these nice feature fireplaces and views if I can't share my #cottagecore on Instagram?
Country life was perhaps once synonymous with living off-grid, a hippy idyll for people who wanted to opt out of the system.
