By Nick Gallo and Paris Lawson | okcthunder.comThe Big PictureAfter six preseason games and three weeks of practice, the Thunder's 82-game regular season began in Minnesota against the Timberwolves in a back-and-forth game that resulted in a 115-108 loss for OKC. A scrappy 27-5 run by the Thunder turned a 16-point deficit into a 6-point OKC lead towards the end of the third quarter. Minnesota responded with 7-straight points spanning the final 40 seconds of the third quarter and the first 11 seconds of the fourth, but the Thunder hung in and kept the deficit within single digits for the entirety of the final frame.
