By Will Feuer Shares of Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc. rose about 13% in premarket trading Friday after the company posted higher sales for the first quarter and said staffing levels are improving. The company posted same-store sales growth of 20% from a year earlier, driven mostly by customers spending more at each visit and partially by an increase in traffic. The company has yet to see any signs of consumer weakening, Chief Executive Paul J. B. Murphy said on an earnings call with analysts. "We're seeing an extremely high take rate and more in the premium category of pricing and quite honestly, they just continue to accelerate," he said.
