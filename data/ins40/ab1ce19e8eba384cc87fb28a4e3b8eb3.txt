WEST CHESTER, Pa., May 31, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Venerable is pleased to announce that Kroll Bond Rating Agency, LLC (KBRA) has recently affirmed the BBB- issuer and debt rating of Venerable Holdings, Inc., and the A- insurance financial strength rating of its subsidiaries, Venerable Insurance and Annuity Company (VIAC) and Corporate Solutions Life Reinsurance Company (CSLR), as well as VIAC's and CSLR's BBB surplus note ratings. In addition, KBRA has upwardly revised their outlook of Venerable from Stable to Positive, noting that it is expected that Venerable will continue to successfully onboard and manage acquired books of business, and that future acquisitions will be structured and financed in a way that would not, for a sustained period, have a material negative impact on Venerable's operational or financial profile or its conservative approach to financial management.
