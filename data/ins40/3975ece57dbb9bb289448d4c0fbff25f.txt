A Labour motion that would have forced a vote on a bill to ban fracking has been defeated in the Commons.230 MPs voted in favour of the motion, while 326 were against it, a government majority of 96.
There are suggestions that the chief whip Wendy Morton has resigned, according to Sky's political editor Beth Rigby.Ahead of the Commons showdown, many Conservative MPs expressed disquiet about Ms Truss's plan to return to fracking where there is "local consent".Chris Skidmore, the MP and governmental net-zero tsar, said he would not be voting with the government and was "prepared to face the consequences of my decision".
