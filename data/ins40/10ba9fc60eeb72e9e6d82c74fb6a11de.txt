Used-car dealer Carzam has collapsed just 18 months after its launch, in a sign that the online car boom has crashed.The Peterborough firm, co-founded by Big Motoring World boss Peter Waddell, has appointed administrators at Smith & Williamson after it entered voluntary receivership on Tuesday.It comes just six months after Carzam said it had raised £112 million from a New York fund. That is understood to have been Davidson Kempner, the hedge fund, and with the money taking the form of debt rather than equity.
