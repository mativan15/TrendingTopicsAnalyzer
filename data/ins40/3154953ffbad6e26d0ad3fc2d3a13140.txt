The Baltimore Ravens decided to trust their young wide receivers as they entered the 2022 season. After the trade of Marquise Brown and the departures of Sammy Watkins and Miles Boykin, the only outside addition the team made at the position during the offseason was Demarcus Robinson.
One of the wideouts already on the roster who has made the most of his opportunity has been Devin Duvernay. The third-year man out of Texas has either had 50 receiving yards or a touchdown in every game so far in 2022, and has established important chemistry with quarterback Lamar Jackson.
