Eoneren/E+ via Getty Images Gladstone Investment Corporation (NASDAQ:GAIN) is a well-managed business development firm whose dividend payouts consistently exceeded its net investment profits in the previous year. The BDC focuses on high-quality first and second liens, but it also invests a sizable portion of its portfolio in equity, which Gladstone Investment has done successfully in the past. While the company has some upside potential, as it trades at a premium to book value, the main reason to buy GAIN is the BDC's outstanding income potential.
