Khanchit Khirisutchalual/iStock via Getty Images Canadian biotech Aurinia Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AUPH) lost ~4% pre-market Friday after the company announced that its Chief Medical Officer, Neil Solomons, and Executive Vice President, Research, Robert Huizinga, will resign from their positions effective Oct. 31. The disclosure made via a regulatory filing includes the terms of the resignations, as agreed between the parties on Oct. 17. Aurinia (AUPH) shares surged ahead of the announcement on Thursday, exactly a year after Bloomberg reported that pharma giant Bristol Myers (BMY) approached to make a buyout offer for the company.
