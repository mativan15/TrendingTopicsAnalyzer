The UK is preparing to help Queen Elizabeth II celebrate her Platinum Jubilee, 70 years after she first took the crown.
Queen Elizabeth has lived through some momentous moments, from the Second World War to the Covid-19 pandemic.
But while she may be massively respected as a Head of State, there are more than a few people who aren't too fond of the Monarchy – one of them being punk band the Sex Pistols.
As the Platinum Jubilee rapidly approaches, we're reminded of another Jubilee where there was a bit of controversy – the Sex Pistols releasing their (almost) number one hit God Save The Queen.
