Google was hit with a lawsuit in Texas Thursday, as state Attorney General Ken Paxton alleged that Google collected millions of Texans' biometric identifiers, including facial and voice recognition information, without their explicit consent.The suit -- which says Google violated a state consumer protection law -- accuses the internet company of using products and services like Google Photos, Google Assistant and Nest Hub Max to collect the information."Google's exploitation of the personal information of Texans for its own commercial interests is a knowing violation of the state's Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act," Paxton's office stated in a press release.
