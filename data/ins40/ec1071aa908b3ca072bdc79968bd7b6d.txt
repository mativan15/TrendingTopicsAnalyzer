US stocks edged higher on Thursday, extending gains from Wednesday's session as investors seek to end a seven-week losing streak in the S&P 500.The move higher on Thursday came as investors continue to weigh the possibility of an economic recession against strong earnings results from retail companies like Dollar Tree and Dollar General, which both soared more than 10% in Thursday trades.First-quarter GDP was revised slightly lower, to a contraction of 1.5% from its initial reading of a 1.4% decline, but retail sales were revised higher, signaling that consumers have not slowed down in their spending habits despite rising inflation and higher interest rates.
