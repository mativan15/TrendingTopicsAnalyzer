Rama Vaidyanathan's group production ‘Pratibodhana' – An Awakening' was not just an awakening from sleep to wakefulness, it was an awakening from the slumber of ignorance to divine knowledge and deliverance (moksha).

The choreography stood out for picturesque formations, interesting jathi patterns, and subtle but beautiful abhinaya. Organised by Sanathana Natyalaya and Nrityangan at Don Bosco Hall, Mangaluru, the production appropriately began with songs from Manickavachagar's ‘Thiruvembavai' — ‘Annae, Ivaiyum Silavo' and ‘Kozhi Silamba Silambum'.
