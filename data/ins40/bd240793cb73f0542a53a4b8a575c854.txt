The spark: The loss can be attributed to Lil Baby's dive into cryptocurrency. He once believed the space would be a safer bet than gambling. Therefore, he was open to exploring new ways to secure a bag.

The result: During an interview with Sway Calloway, the 'Drip Too Hard' rapper shared that although he did earn some money, ultimately he lost millions of dollars from investing his dollars in cryptocurrency.
