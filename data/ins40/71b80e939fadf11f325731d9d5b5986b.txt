Elle Mundus I covered Northwest Biotherapeutics (OTCQB:NWBO) in 2018 for the first time. Then in 2020, when their so-called trial was locked, I began covering it more often. I was hoping that like any normal company, NWBO will unblind their trial, publish their data, and get on with the regulatory process. So I covered the company 9 times so far, out of which 3 times I said Buy. Prices at publication for these 3 articles were $1.36, $1.24 and $.71, respectively, and the dates were Dec 20, 2020, Oct 13, 2021, and May 21, 2022, respectively.
