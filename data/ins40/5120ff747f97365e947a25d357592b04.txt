An 83-year-old Japanese adventurer has become the oldest person in the world to complete a solo, non-stop voyage across the Pacific Ocean – and said he is still 'in the middle of my youth' and not done yet.Kenichi Horie crossed the Kii Strait off Japan's western coast early on Saturday, completing his trans-Pacific solo voyage in 69 days after leaving a yacht harbour in San Francisco in late March.On Sunday, after spending the night on his 19ft (5.8m), 2,182lb (990kg) Suntory Mermaid III just off the coast, he was towed into his home port of Shin Nishinomiya, where he was cheered by local residents and supporters, some holding banners that read: 'Welcome back, Mr Kenichi Horie!'

As he approached the harbour, Mr Horie, standing in his boat, took off his white cap and waved.
