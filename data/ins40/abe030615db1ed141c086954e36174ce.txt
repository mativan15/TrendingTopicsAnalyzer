Redfin Corp. shares sank to their lowest level on record Wednesday, after the residential real-estate brokerage reported a sharp drop in September home sales and listings that suggests a housing-market 'standstill' in which prices budged only slightly even as higher mortgage rates crimp demand. The number of homes sold last month fell 25% year-over-year, and new listings fell 22%, Redfin RDFN, -8.35% disclosed. Those were the biggest decreases on record with the exception of the early months of the pandemic, Redfin said.
