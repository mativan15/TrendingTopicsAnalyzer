 Aditxt (NASDAQ:ADTX) stock rose ~7% on Friday after the company said its program Adimune started the GMP manufacturing of immunotherapy drug candidate ADI-100 for its first-in-human trials in H2 2023.
Pending regulatory approvals, these trials will be performed in autoimmune diseases, with psoriasis as the first indication to be studied, the company added.
Aditxt noted that its Adimunes nucleic acid-based technology called Apoptotic DNA Immunotherapy (ADI) restores/induces immune tolerance in an antigen-specific way and potentially has efficacy benefit without immune suppression.
