UK government officials are mulling a sale of chipmaker Newport Wafer Fab to a US consortium instead of allowing its agreed deal with China-owned Nexperia to stand.

This is according to reports at the weekend in the Telegraph, which also claimed the agreement could be funded in part by a grant from the UK government itself.

Newport Wafer Fab is one of the few facilities left in the UK that still manufactures semiconductors, but it was sold last year in a deal worth £63 million to Dutch company Nexperia, which is now a subsidiary of Chinese outfit Wingtech Technology.
