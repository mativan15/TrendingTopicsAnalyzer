In 1963, Gibson Guitar commissioned the legendary car designer Ray Dietrich to sketch an electric guitar. The idea was to bring in a creative voice from outside the traditional music world who would investigate the possibilities of the electric guitar in shape and feel — introduce a high dose of innovation. And Dietrich was quite the innovator, having pioneered the concept of the custom-built car designer in the age of classic cars. Introduced in 1963, with its asymmetrical shape and the taller horn positioned on the right rather than the customary left, the Firebird broke almost all conventions of a solid-body electric guitar.
