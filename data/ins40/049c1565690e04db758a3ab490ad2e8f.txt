A Sony DualSense Edge controller with the parts and systems coming together.



Sony's new DualSense Edge controller adds some customizability but seems to appear very similar to a regular $50 DualSense.

How much are you willing to spend for the ability to fine-tune the stick sensitivity and trigger dead zones—oh, and back buttons—on your PlayStation DualSense controller? I hope you just said 'an extra $130,' because that's how much it's about to cost come next year.



PlayStation finally showed off its new DualSense Edge controller on Tuesday that looks exactly like a regular DualSense controller, except maybe a little more black on its front face.
