Lora and Matt in the MorningBy Lora SongsterMay 27, 2022Meet Ranger, our Mix 99.5 Pet of the Week with Lora Songster! Ranger is described as the perfect companion! Happy to be with his people but no need to be completely up in their business at all moments (he prefers if you potty alone -- he doesn't see a need for a family meeting in the bathroom)! He is an older, wiser guy but still enjoys a good game of tug-of-war! Visit www.doxiebyproxy.org to learn more about adopting Ranger! https://www.doxiebyproxy.
