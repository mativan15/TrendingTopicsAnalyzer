VisualArtStudio/iStock via Getty Images Dearest readers, Yara International (OTCPK:YARIY) is a company I've been following for some time. The company has been a primary net beneficiary of the current environment. Even if some, including myself, point out that there are cost risks and inflation problems, the simple fact is that there has never been as much demand for Yara products and services as there are today. There's a very simple, and very strong positive sale price delta that is enabling the company to consistently outperform here.
