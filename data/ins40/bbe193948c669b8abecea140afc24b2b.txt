Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has insisted that people in Madrid 'do not love' Gareth Bale ahead of Saturday night's Champions League final. The Welshman is leaving Real Madrid at the end of the season upon the expiration of his contract, bringing an end to his nine-year stay in the Spanish capital. Ironically, his greatest moment for the club arguably came four years ago – when he netted twice as the Spanish giants defeated the Reds 3-1 in the Champions League final. Bale has recently hit out at Spanish media outlet Marca as being 'disgusting' for comparing him to a parasite over claims he is sucking money out of the Spanish giants.
