Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) general secretary, Jay Shah on Tuesday, said that India won't be travelling to Pakistan for the 2023 Asia Cup and the tournament will be held at a neutral venue.
'For Pakistan, we have stated policy that we need government clearance. As far as Asia Cup is concerned, which is supposed to be held in Pakistan next year, it will take place at a neutral venue,' Shah told reporters on the sidelines of the 91st BCCI Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Mumbai.
India last travelled to Pakistan for the bilateral series in 2005-06 under the captaincy of current Team India coach Rahul Dravid.
