Elon Musk admitted he has a bit of buyer's remorse over his $44 billion acquisition deal for Twitter — but the mercurial mega-billionaire believes the social network will be worth far more in the future.

On Tesla's third-quarter 2022 earnings call Wednesday, Musk commented, 'Although, obviously, myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for Twitter right now, the long-term potential for Twitter in my view is an order of magnitude greater than its current value.'

Musk added that he's 'excited about the Twitter situation': 'I think it's massive that this sort of languished for a long time, but has an incredible potential.
