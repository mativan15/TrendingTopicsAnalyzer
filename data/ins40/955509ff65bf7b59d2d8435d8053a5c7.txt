For the first time since the pandemic began, 'The Walk to Make Cystic Fibrosis History' was held Sunday afternoon in Regina. The walk was held to raise awareness about the disease and to raise money for research into new medications. Trikafta is one of the most recent medications approved for use in Saskatchewan. For Alison Hamilton, it's a call she will never forget. 'It was the most amazing phone call I have ever received,' said Hamilton. 'The email started off by saying, ‘Hi Alison, this is the cystic fibrosis nurse and this is the email you have been waiting for,' and everything after that was a blur.
