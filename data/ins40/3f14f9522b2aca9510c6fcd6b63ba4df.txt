China is a key trading partner for Germany, especially for its flagship automotive industry.
Mr Scholz declined to confirm whether he would travel to China with Mr Macron, whose office did not respond to a question on the issue.
Cosco deal not yet authorised
Chinese shipping giant Cosco is due to take a 35 per cent stake in a container terminal in Hamburg, in a deal agreed last year but not yet authorised by the German federal government.
German media this week reported that the chancellery was planning to approve the deal despite opposition from six different ministries in Mr Scholz's coalition government with the Greens and the liberal FDP.
