My title is not a great analogy.My Blog. Deal with it.I'm gobsmacked by the idea that our lefty government "leaders" think paying off student loan debt might be a good idea. I know my first question is NOT obvious to only me-You signed a contract. You got the benefit of that contract. Now, fulfill the promise you made by signing your name. Pay what you now owe!Second thought-I once had a conversation with a young socialist female that called these contracts "predatory lending".What other contracts fall into that category? Auto loans? Mortgages? Handouts from "Cousin Vinnie"?My college education was accomplished piecemeal.
