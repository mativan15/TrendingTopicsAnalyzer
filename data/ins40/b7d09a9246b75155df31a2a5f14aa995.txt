Odell Beckham Jr.'s time with the Cleveland Browns came to an end last November when he was placed on waivers. It was the latest turbulent stop for the talented but mercurial wide receiver and many wondered who would be willing to take a chance on bringing Beckham Jr. into their locker room.
The answer came when Beckham cleared waivers and quickly signed a team-friendly one-year, $1.25 million contract with the Los Angeles Rams. On the day that Beckham arrived at the Rams' facility, the team lost wide receiver Robert Woods for the season to an ACL tear in practice.
