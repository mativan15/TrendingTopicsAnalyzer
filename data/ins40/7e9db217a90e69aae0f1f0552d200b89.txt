The Conservative Party "won't be forgiven" for pushing ahead with Liz Truss's efforts to resuscitate the fracking industry, campaigners say. On Wednesday evening the government forced MPs to break a manifesto pledge and vote against a proposed ban on shale gas extraction amid chaotic scenes. Opposition MPs and environmental campaigners accused Tories voting with the government of opting to "prop up a zombie prime minister", to save their own careers rather than take a stand on the environmental issues affecting their constituents.
