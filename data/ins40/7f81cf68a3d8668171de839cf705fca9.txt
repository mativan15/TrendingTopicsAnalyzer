The Daily Telegraph says Rishi Sunak is pushing towards a "coronation" in the Tory leadership race by securing the majority of MPs as Boris Johnson backers began warning of a stitch-up. The paper says it can reveal that Kemi Badenoch, the International Trade Secretary, and Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, are considering backing Johnson, in what would be a major boost that could unify the right of the party. Penny Mordaunt has told the paper that she promises a government of all the talents and puts a Whitehall shake-up at the heart of her Tory leadership pitch.
