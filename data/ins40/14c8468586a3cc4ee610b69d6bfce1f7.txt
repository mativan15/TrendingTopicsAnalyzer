Mandy Moore and her husband, Taylor Goldsmith, have welcomed their second child together. In a black-and-white photo announcement posted on Instagram, Moore shared the news and the baby boy's name, Oscar Bennett Goldsmith, or Ozzie for short. He joins big brother Gus, who arrived back in February 2021. The photo carousel shows Moore and Goldsmith holding little Ozzie.

"Ozzie is here! Oscar Bennett Goldsmith arrived a little late but with much aplomb (and an easier/speedier delivery than his big brother, much to the delight of his parents)," Moore wrote alongside the images.
