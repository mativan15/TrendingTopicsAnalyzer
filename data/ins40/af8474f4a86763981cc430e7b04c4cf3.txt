LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - A second group of investors has filed a multi-million pound London lawsuit over the failure of veteran stock picker Neil Woodford's now-defunct equity income fund, which left more than 300,000 nursing losses.

Marking the third anniversary since the fund's suspension, Harcus Parker said on Friday it had filed the case at London's High Court on behalf of an initial 1,500 investors. They are seeking damages of 18 million pounds-plus ($23 million-plus) against Link Fund Solutions over its handling of the fund.
