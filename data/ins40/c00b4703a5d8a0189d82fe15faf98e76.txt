SeaWorld is opening up three new rides, including the world's "first surf coaster," one in each of its locations in Orlando, San Antonio and San Diego."We strive to continually bring new thrills to our parks while also providing unique and engaging experiences with marine life that guests may not otherwise ever have a chance to have," SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment CEO Marc Swanson said in a statement. SeaWorld Orlando will be home to the world's "first surf coaster," Pipeline: The Surf Coaster. The ride is met to emulate the feeling of riding the waves.
