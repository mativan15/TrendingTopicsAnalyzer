Victoria Derbyshire has praised Dame Deborah James for ‘all she has achieved' since being diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2017.
Dame Deborah, 40, is currently under hospice care at home as active treatment is no longer possible.
The journalist was knighted in May after raising more than £6million for bowel cancer research through her Bowelbabe Fund, and was visited at home by Prince William.
BBC News presenter Victoria was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, for which she underwent a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy and has been cancer-free since.
