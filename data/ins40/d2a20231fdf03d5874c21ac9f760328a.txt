Encore Theater is Wynn Las Vegas' striking, intimate venue, with a capacity that belies how wonderful the view is from every seat, and is among the best places to see a show in Las Vegas.

It's no wonder that the theater is filling its lineup with equally amazing acts.

Beginning in November, Encore Theater at Wynn Las Vegas welcomes back resident headliner John Fogerty. The Creedence Clearwater Revival singer and successful solo artist will play the catalog of his band's songs as well as solo hits like 'Centerfield.
