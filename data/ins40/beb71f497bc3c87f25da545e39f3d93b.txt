Hi-TECH cameras will be used to crackdown on boy racers who rev their motors late at night.
Trials of the noise detecting technology will start this week with cops able to dish out fines to drivers who've illegally made their Fords sound like a Ferrari.

The clampdown will start in Bradford this week before being moved to other areas blighted by the anti-social noise pollution.
