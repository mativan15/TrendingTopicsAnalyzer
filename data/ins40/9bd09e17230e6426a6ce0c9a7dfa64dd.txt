The board of First Guaranty Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FGBI) has announced that it will pay a dividend of US$0.16 per share on the 30th of June. The dividend yield is 2.2% based on this payment, which is a little bit low compared to the other companies in the industry.

While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that First Guaranty Bancshares' stock price has increased by 34% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield.
