Social media giants TikTok and Facebook approved ads with "blatant" disinformation about the upcoming US midterm elections, a new report published Friday found. A recent investigation by the nonprofit Global Witness and the Cyber Security for Democracy team at New York University analyzed Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube's ability "to detect and remove election disinformation" in the lead-up to November's midterms. The groups found that TikTok — which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance — fared the worst of the three platforms when it came to failing to block the "deceptive" test ads submitted by the researchers.
