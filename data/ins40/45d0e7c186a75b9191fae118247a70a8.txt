The new Apple iPad has been unveiled and there are plenty of changes, many of them surprising. There's a new design, new colors, new Touch ID, bigger display, faster processor, USB-C connector and a new Magic Keyboard Folio. But there's a catch: a significant price increase. The Apple iPad 10th generation will go on sale on Wednesday, October 26, with pre-orders starting today. The price is noticeably higher than the 9th generation which started at $329 (and remains in the line-up at the same price).
