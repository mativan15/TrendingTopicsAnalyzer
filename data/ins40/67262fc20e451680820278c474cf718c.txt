Interest rates on savings accounts have been increasing since the Bank of England (BoE) upped the base rate from 1.75 to 2.25 percent in September. The bank is set to announce the next increase on November 3, which could drive interest rates on savings accounts up even further.  Barclay's Rainy Day Saver pays the top rate of 5.12 percent AER on balances up to £5,000. However, anything above this, the interest rate drops to 0.15 percent.People can open an account with just one pound and can set up a standing order to help them grow their savings pot.
