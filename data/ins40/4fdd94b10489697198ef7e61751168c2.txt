Sandy Herz is leaving her position as president of Sobrato Philanthropies, one of the Bay Area's most generous corporate givers.

Herz assumed the role as head of the nonprofit in June 2020. Her departure a little more than two years later was the result of a "mutual decision" with The Sobrato Organization's philanthropic arm, she told the Business Journal.

"I am leaving Sobrato but remain very committed to the Sobrato family and the work that we built together over the last few years," she said.
