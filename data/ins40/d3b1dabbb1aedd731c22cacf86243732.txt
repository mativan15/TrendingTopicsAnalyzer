US households gained about $2.5 trillion in excess savings since March 2020 from stimulus and higher wages.

The extra cash has helped keep consumer spending strong, which in turn has driven prices higher.

Now inflation is gnawing away at those savings, and CEOs warn they could run out within months.

The US economy has been mostly beating expectations for two years now, thanks in large part to consumers eagerly buying just about everything that companies could sell them.
