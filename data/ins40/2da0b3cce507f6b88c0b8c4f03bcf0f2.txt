Cecilie_Arcurs/E+ via Getty Images Investment Thesis In my previous article on ASGN Inc. (NYSE:ASGN), I discussed how the company had a good moat and a solid track record of exceeding the industry's average growth rate. You can read about it here. Since then, ASGN lost ~18.2% vs a loss of ~11% for the S&P 500 and has underperformed the market. ASGN recently reported Q1 FY22 results, which topped analysts' expectations. The company continues to deliver solid double-digit top-line growth and is now well on track to achieve its FY22 guidance.
