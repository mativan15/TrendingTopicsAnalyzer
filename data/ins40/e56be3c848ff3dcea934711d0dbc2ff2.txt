Potholes in Bengaluru have turned into death traps, said Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy on Wednesday, days after a 50-year-old woman, who was riding pillion on a scooter, fell on the road while trying to navigate a pothole and run over by a state transport bus. 'Potholes have turned into death traps. After another loss of life near Lulu Mall, the govt is enacting drama to show they are active. Where is the permanent solution? Murderous potholes are responsible for series of deaths,' Kumaraswamy tweeted.
