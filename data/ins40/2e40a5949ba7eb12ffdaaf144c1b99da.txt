One of the big questions facing Penn State's defense in 2022 is how different it will look under new defensive coordinator Manny Diaz compared to former coordinator Brent Pry, now the head coach at Virginia Tech. If the reaction of one second-year player is any indication, it may be easier to understand how the defense works.
Second-year linebacker kobe king, the twin brother of cornerback Kalen King, said he believes Diaz's defense is easier to grasp than Pry's system.
'Manny Diaz, his whole style of defense is just kind of more simple to me than Coach Pry's,' King said recently, according to Bob Flounders of PennLive.
