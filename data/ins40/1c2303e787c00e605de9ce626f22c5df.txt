Business conditions in the United Arab Emirates improved in May to the strongest this year even as companies came under pressure from inflation and largely chose to absorb higher costs.

Output in the country's non-oil economy increased at the fastest pace since last December and employment saw a renewed increase, according to a survey published by S&P Global on Friday. Its UAE Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 55.6, from 54.6 in April, remaining above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
