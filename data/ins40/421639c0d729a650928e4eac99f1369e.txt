Jun. 4—VERNON TOWNSHIP — Vernon Township will have to pitch in some general fund money to pay for a repaving project that originally was anticipated to be covered using grant money.

Township supervisors voted unanimously to accept the bid from Joseph McCormick Construction Co. Inc. to resurface the Roche Park Trail and trail parking lot for $180,505.86.

"They were the only company to bid on this project, but we felt the price was fair," said Township Manager Robert Horvat at the meeting. "Unfortunately, since we initially started this project in 2019, the price of asphalt has gone up dramatically.
