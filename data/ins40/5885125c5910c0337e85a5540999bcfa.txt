Shareholders have seen payouts soar £440 billion above inflation since 2008 even as wages have stagnated, according to the Trade Union Congress (TUC).An analysis by the organisation suggests that wages have grown £510 billion less than inflation, even as dividends to shareholders have grown.The TUC accused the Government of failing to reform company law to ensure that workers do not lose out to shareholders.It said that before the financial crisis payouts grew at double the rate of wages, but that has since increased, with dividends now growing at more than three times the rate of wages.
