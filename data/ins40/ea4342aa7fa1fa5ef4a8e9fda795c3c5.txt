The Central Forensic Laboratory (CFSL), Kolkata, has refused to share the electropherogram report of the DNA sample of Gumnami Baba, who some believe was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in the guise of a sadhu, citing Sections 8(1)(A), (E) and 11(1) of the Right to Information Act, 2005.
In response to an RTI query of one Sayak Sen, the CFSL, however, agreed that the electropherogram report of DNA sample of Gumnami Baba, who died in 1985, is in its custody.
Though it is widely believed that Bose died in an aircrash on August 18, 1945, in Taiwan, a section of people claims that he survived the crash and went into hiding to escape the then British government.
