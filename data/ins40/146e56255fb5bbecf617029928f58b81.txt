Simon Cowell might be the man behind Britain's Got Talent, but even he's not immune to criticism, especially from his eight-year-old son.
The judge admitted on this week's grand final that little Eric had given him an ‘earful' after popular act Amber & The Dancing Collies was eliminated from the show.
Luckily for Eric, Amber and (one of) the collies, Nymeria, were brought back as a wildcard to compete in the final. 
Their Grease-themed routine only featured one dog this time after Simon said that their semi-final performance with two dogs was too much.
