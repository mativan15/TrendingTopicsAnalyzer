Federal Bank, part of the private sector banking space, has rallied more than 30% in the last 3 months to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 132.65 on 17 October but the rally may not be over yet. The technical setup suggests that the upside could get extended towards Rs 150 levels in the next few weeks, suggest experts. Short-term traders can look to buy the stock now or on dips, they say. The stock with a market capitalisation of more than Rs 27,000 crore bounced back after retesting its 50-DMA on the daily charts around Rs 109 on 26 September 2022.
