It's officially spooky season, as we get closer to Halloween. Not only were gaming fans treated to new announcements for the Silent Hill series but now they can also enjoy some updates on another iconic horror series, Resident Evil. Japanese game developer Capcom's flagship series has been a staple of the genre since it was first introduced on the PS1 in 1996. Now, one of its most critically successful entries into the series, Resident Evil 4, is getting the remake treatment, similar to the recently released second and third mainline games.
