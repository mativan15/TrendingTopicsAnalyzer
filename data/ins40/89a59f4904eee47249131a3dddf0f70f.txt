Investigation is on to trace the source of a sack of gelatine sticks and detonators found discarded near the Government Ganapath Vocational Higher Secondary School near Feroke on Monday.Though preliminary findings confirm that there was no deliberate attempt to endanger public safety, efforts are on to locate those who reportedly purchased the product for quarry blasts and later abandoned it, violating the provisions of the Explosives Act.According to the police, there were 59 gelatine sticks and 60 detonators in the sack which was recovered during a cleaning drive near the school.
