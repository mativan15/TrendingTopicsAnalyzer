Solar panels made in America are rapidly increasing in popularity. In addition to the United State's growing ability to manufacture the components of solar panels, policy incentives, such as those that result in financial benefit for solar customers and tariffs on imported solar panels, have contributed to the rise in companies manufacturing their solar panels in America and consumers seeking them.
The United States solar industry employs around 250,000 people as of 2022 and is expected to see continued job growth year over year.
