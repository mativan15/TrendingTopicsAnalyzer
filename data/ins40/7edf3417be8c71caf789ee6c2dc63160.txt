Georgia wide receiver Dominick Blaylock (8) celebrates with his teammates after scoring a touchdown during the first half of a NCAA college football game between Vanderbilt and Georgia in Athens, Ga., on Saturday, Oct. 15, 2022.

With much of the college football world focused on a top 10 SEC matchup with major implications more than 200 miles north of Athens, Georgia dispatched its outclassed opponent rather easily.

The Bulldogs headed into a bye week after crushing Vanderbilt 55-0 Saturday afternoon in Sanford Stadium.
