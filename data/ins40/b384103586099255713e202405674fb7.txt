By Kim Richters German luxury car maker BMW AG said Wednesday that it will invest $1.7 billion in its operations in the U.S. as it prepares to produce battery-electric vehicles in the country. The auto maker said it has earmarked $1 billion to adapt its existing manufacturing plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, for the production of battery-electric vehicles. The site will become an important driver for the company's electrification strategy and BMW plans to make at least six fully-electric models there by 2030, it said.
