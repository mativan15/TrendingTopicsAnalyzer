June 03, 2022 10:25 AM Eastern Daylight Time OLDWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AM Best will host an analytical briefing on the expanding non-catastrophe insurance-linked securities (ILS) market on Tuesday, June 21, 2022, at 10 a.m. (EDT).

Prominent reinsurers and specialist underwriters increasingly have been facilitating transactions to help investors achieve their diversification goals and tap new insurance-linked returns. As the non-catastrophe ILS market expands, AM Best has observed heightened interest for these types of transactions; specifically, ones that involve the transfer of casualty and liability insurance risks to capital market investors in a securitized format.
