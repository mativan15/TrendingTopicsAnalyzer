Amherstburg Town Council has approved spending $20,000 to step up security when the Admirals hockey team play on home ice following reports of harrassment and vandalism.   All but one councillor voted in favour of the spend during Monday's council meeting.  A report on the agenda says a group or groups of youth have been causing problems at the Libro Centre during the games since the last leg of the 2021 season. That problem is apparently getting worse and worse through time. Harassment of staff and patrons as well as vandalism of town facilities being perpetrated by a group, or groups, of youth, the report theorizes.
