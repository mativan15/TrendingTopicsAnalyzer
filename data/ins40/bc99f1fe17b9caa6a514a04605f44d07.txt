THIS is the dramatic moment a former Chinese leader was manhandled out of the closing ceremony of the Communist Party Congress.
Hu Jintao, 79, appeared reluctant to be escorted from the front row of proceedings at Beijing's Great Hall of the People - where he was sitting next to President Xi Jinping.

Footage showed a steward trying to take Hu - who was China's leader from 2003 to 2013 - by the arm before being shaken off.
