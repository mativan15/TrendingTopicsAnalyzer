The reserve funds for Social Security and Medicare programs will last longer than previously thought — thanks to a faster and stronger-than-expected recovery from the 2020 pandemic-induced recession.The main Social Security trust fund will continue paying out full benefits through 2034, according to the annual report released Thursday from the trustees of the programs. That's one year later than what was stated in the 2021 report.Meantime, a key Medicare trust fund could run low on funds by 2028, two years later than reported last year.
