By CBSBoston.com Staff June 2, 2022 / 6:29 AM / CBS Boston BOSTON -- There was only one player listed on the Celtics' injury report for Game 1 of the NBA Finals. That one name should come as no surprise: Robert Williams.The Celtics center will likely have a "questionable" tag the rest of the way as he continues to deal with knee soreness. Celtics head coach Ime Udoka continues to say that Williams' status is a "true day-to-day" situation, so the Boston big man will be a coin flip throughout the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors.
