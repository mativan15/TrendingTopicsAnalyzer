A 72-year-old US citizen has been sentenced to 16 years in jail by a court in Saudi Arabia for tweets he sent while living in the US.

Saad Ibrahim Almadi, who has dual US and Saudi nationality and lives in Florida, was detained in November 2021 after arriving in Riyadh for a family visit.

His detention was not publicised until it was first reported in an opinion piece in the Washington Post, but the US State Department has now confirmed details.

'We have consistently and intensively raised our concerns regarding the case at senior levels of the Saudi government,' deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said at a regular briefing.
