Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble Co. is warning shareholders to reject a lowball offer by a Canadian investment firm.

P&G (NYSE: PG) recommends shareholders reject an offer by TRC Capital Investment Corp. to purchase up to 1 million shares of P&G stock at a price of $118.63 per share. The offer undercuts P&G's current share price of around $129 by nearly $11.

If TRC Capital Investment Corp. were to buy 1 million shares of P&G from shareholders at its reduced offer, the company stands to profit nearly $11 million.
