Centrist Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-Nassau) and left-leaning Public Advocate Jumaane Williams joined forces Thursday in attacking Governor Kathy Hochul, who skipped the first televised debate of the Democratic campaign.
'Although we have some differences. At least we both showed up. I really wish that the governor would have as well. I think New Yorkers deserve to hear the different visions that we have,' Williams said at the beginning of the hour-long debate hosted by NY1.
A campaign spokesperson for Hochul said she did not participate so that she could focus on legislative issues on the final day of the scheduled 2022 session.
