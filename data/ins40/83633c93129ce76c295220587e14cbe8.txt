Two struggling teams come limping into Thursday night when the Arizona Cardinals face the New Orleans Saints. The Cardinals have lost three of four, while the Saints have dropped four of five.
Arizona is a slight home favorite, but neither team instills much confidence in me right now. Instead of taking a side or total, I'm looking at a player prop with Kyler Murray. 
Murray's passing props are Over/Under 245.5 yards and 1.5 touchdowns. I think both Overs are good plays. New Orleans has really struggled to stop the pass in its last three games.
