The premium inner-city areas of the residential property market in Australia's biggest cities are cooling off faster than the low and middle sections of the market.

Inner-city house prices in suburbs such as Darlinghurst and Surry Hills in Sydney, and Balaclava and Port Melbourne in Melbourne have seen some of the sharpest downturns in the past quarter, according to CoreLogic data.
