If you want to join the mile high club you better pay homage to Jack Harlow and fly first class. 
Nearly 73% of American adults plan to travel this summer, but be warned. Flying too much with cheap tickets can ruin your sex drive. 
Dr. Florence Comite is warning travelers that flying economy too often might cool things off in the bedroom. 
The Brooklyn-based endocrinologist, who graduated from Yale, recommends that people think twice about the impact their travel habits have on their health. 
In a video, Comite explains the link between anxiety, claustrophobia and the lack of space and how this can deplete someone's libido — especially if they're sitting in cheap and cramped economy seats.
