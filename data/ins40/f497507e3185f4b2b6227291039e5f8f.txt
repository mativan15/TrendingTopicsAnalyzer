Oct. 18—BEMIDJI — For local artist Bonnie Lee, it felt like losing her loved ones twice.

Both Tina Martin, Lee's childhood best friend, and her cousin Dawn Sandquist-Anderson were victims of domestic violence. Not only were they murdered by their abusive husbands, but afterward no one wanted to speak about them.

"The first thing I noticed was no one wanted to talk about them around me," Lee shared. "It's like I lost them twice. I lost them through murder, then I lost their memory. I wasn't even allowed to talk about them.
