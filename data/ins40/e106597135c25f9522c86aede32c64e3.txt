VANCOUVER - Supporters of British Columbia's next premier admire it, while his rivals are wary of it.

Both agree that David Eby's brain is not to be taken lightly.

Eby has developed a reputation for tackling some of the most complex and contentious portfolios on the B.C. government's plate while in cabinet and bringing fierce arguments to the table against his opponents.

Soon, he'll test that experience as the province's leader at a time of overlapping crises in health care, housing, public safety and climate disasters.
