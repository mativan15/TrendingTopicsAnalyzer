These are dubious times. Everyone knows there is a problem, but mixed messages abound about what, exactly, the nature of that problem is and how to solve it. The abhorrent phrase"fake news" has entered the lexicon, scores have abandoned science in favor of YouTube, and just about the only thing anyone can agree on is that the story spun by politicians and the media-at least the story told by those on the other side (we like to pick and choose which liars we believe)-is not to be trusted.

Trust in the narrative.
