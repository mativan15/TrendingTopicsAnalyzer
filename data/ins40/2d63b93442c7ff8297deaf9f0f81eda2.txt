If you want a loan with steady, even payments and want to pay it off quickly, Fundit's short-term business loans may be able to help. Merchant Cash Advance
Fundit doesn't provide much information about its merchant cash advances, so it's hard to know whether they're the right company to look into if that's what you're after. Typically, merchant cash advances are structured so that you make daily or weekly payments as a percentage of your sales until the loan is repaid. Business Line of Credit
Fundit offers business lines of credit that you can use to cover gaps in funding when you're not exactly sure when they'll happen.
