Whether to power translation to document summarization, enterprises are increasing their investments in natural language processing (NLP) technologies. According to a 2021 survey from John Snow Labs and Gradient Flow, 60% of tech leaders indicated that their NLP budgets grew by at least 10% compared to 2020, while a third said that spending climbed by more than 30%.

It's a fiercely competitive market. Beyond well-resourced startups like OpenAI, Cohere, AI21 Labs, and Hugging Face and tech giants including Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, there's a new crop of vendors building NLP services on top of open source AI models.
