Embattled U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss has resigned following a tumultuous few weeks in office now distinguished as the shortest term in history.

Truss announced her resignation Thursday in a short statement outside her office at 10 Downing Street.

'I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the conservative party,' she said.

She said she informed King Charles she would resign, but plans to remain prime minister until a successor has been chosen.

Truss, appointed by Queen Elizabeth on Sept.
