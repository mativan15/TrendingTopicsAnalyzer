Collider.com The future of DC Films has been rocky due to Warner Brothers' recent Merger with Discovery and David Zaslav taking over the famous studio. However, in the last decade, there have been a couple of gems in DC's catalog that fans have held on tight to. One of those films is Zack Snyder's Man of Steel starring Henry Cavill as Superman. It's the film that kicked off the Dceu as we know it, but since its release in 2013, Man of Steel never received a sequel.
