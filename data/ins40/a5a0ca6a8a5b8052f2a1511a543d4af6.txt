Two days after the official launch of the student loan forgiveness application, advocates representing borrowers are giving the online process a passing grade.

They are praising the simple, online form and noted the application site so far has not crashed, which happened to the Federal Student Aid (FSA) website soon after President Joe Biden announced up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness in August.

'Borrowers have told me that the application is easy to navigate and quick to complete on their phone, tablets, or on their computers,' Kyra Taylor, a staff attorney for the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC), told Yahoo Money.
