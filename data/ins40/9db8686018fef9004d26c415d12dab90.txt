About the business: Ellie Mental Health is a fast-growing mental health franchise model headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota. And a new Bethesda location at 8120 Woodmont Ave., Suite 840, is the first of multiple Maryland practices that its franchise owner, Montgomery County native Shahzad Dastgir, plans to open this year.

Dastgir was working as a consultant for Optum Inc. doing mergers and acquisitions with large health care systems, including mental health providers. Then about a year and a half ago, he came across Ellie Mental Health.
