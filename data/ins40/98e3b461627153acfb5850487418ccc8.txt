Billy Napier has made it staunchly clear that he's a process-oriented head coach. He was that way in his four years rebuilding the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns and remains the same now in charge of the Florida Gators.

Through thick and through thin, Napier is confident that his vision for rebuilding Florida football is sound and will do exactly that, return UF to championship-caliber play.
