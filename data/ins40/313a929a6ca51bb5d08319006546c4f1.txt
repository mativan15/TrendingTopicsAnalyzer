TAMPA — USF's injury concerns grew Tuesday when the Bulls announced that starting quarterback Gerry Bohanon will miss the rest of the season with a shoulder injury.

The Baylor transfer hurt his right (throwing) shoulder in the first half of last week's home loss to Tulane and will require surgery. Bohanon started every game for the Bulls this season and had thrown for 501 yards, six touchdowns and no interceptions over the past three games. His 386 rushing yards this year ranked second on the team.
