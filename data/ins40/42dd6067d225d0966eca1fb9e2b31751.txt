Was this the biggest upset in postseason history? The Los Angeles Dodgers were on a winning streak like no other – but it is the San Diego Padres who are on their way to the National League Championship Series (NLCS).

Jake Cronenworth capped a five-run Padres seventh with a two-out, two-run tiebreaking single on Saturday night as the Padres bounced back from a 3-0 deficit to eliminate the National League West champions from the playoffs.

The 3-1 National League Division Series (NLDS) win secures the Padres a home spot against Philadelphia, who beat the Atlanta Braves 8-3 to win their NLDS in four games.
