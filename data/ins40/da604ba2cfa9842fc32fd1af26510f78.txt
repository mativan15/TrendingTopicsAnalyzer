Nigeria's main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chose former vice-president Atiku Abubakar as its candidate for February's national election, an early step in a long campaign in the Opec member country.The next president will need to grapple with persistent inflation, slow growth, and high unemployment as Africa's largest economy struggles to recover from its worse recession in four decades in 2020. Deadly conflicts with separatists and Islamic insurgents grind on as well. Abubakar emerged as the PDP's flag-bearer with 371 votes at the party's primaries in the capital Abuja on Saturday.
