Kanye West has hired Johnny Depp's fierce attorney who helped him beat ex-wife Amber Heard's defamation suit, according to a report Friday.
The embattled rapper snapped up 38-year-old lawyer Camille Vasquez and others to oversee his business deals and contracts, sources close to West told TMZ.
The 45-year-old 'Gold Digger' rapper has reportedly faced financial fallout over the wild anti-Semitic attacks he leveled on Twitter earlier this month.
West stirred up controversy on Oct. 10 when he tweeted that he was 'going death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE,' prompting the fashion firm Balenciaga to cut ties with him this week.
