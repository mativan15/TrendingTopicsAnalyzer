Is Taylor Swift signaling her next re-recording with her latest fashion accessory? That's what fans are thinking following her latest outing in N.Y.C.
 
Ahead of the release of her album Midnights, the "Karma" singer and her boyfriend Joe Alwyn were photographed on a walk in New York City on Oct. 17.
 
Swift, 32, wore a long black sweater, plaid skirt and black tights as she smiled next to Alwyn, 31, who donned a long-sleeved green sweater, blue jeans and glasses.
 
During their outing, Swift also carried a Tremont Leather Cross Body Bag by Ralph Lauren, which some Swifties have theorized could be a potential Easter egg about her next re-recording.
