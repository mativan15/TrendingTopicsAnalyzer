Beam Global (NASDAQ:BEEM) reported Thursday a 72% growth in new orders as enterprise and business customers purchasing the company's EV charging system rose since the start of this year. 'We are seeing a strong rebound in non-government revenue now that the impacts of COVID 19 are receding and this is coming at a time when our government sales are accelerating and greater than at any time in our history. New orders from the private sector Q1-Q3 have increased 72% year-over-year as EV adoption and charging demand continue a strong upward trajectory,' said Desmond Wheatley, CEO at Beam Global.
