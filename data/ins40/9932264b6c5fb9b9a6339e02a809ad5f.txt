[Photo/Xinhua] The ongoing 20th CPC National Congress has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life, including foreigners who have lived in China for years. Among the expats who have paid close attention to the major event is Manoj Mehta, the chief executive officer of Shanghai-based naked Group. The company, which started with a bed and breakfast service in renovated farm houses in Moganshan, Zhejiang province, in 2007, has since expanded its business to include luxury resorts, shared work spaces and other products.
