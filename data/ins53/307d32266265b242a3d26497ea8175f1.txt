TORY MPs will tonight be forced to prove their loyalty to Liz Truss in a bombshell vote that could lead to fracking being banned again.
The motion, triggered by Labour, demands that time in the Commons be allocated to a bill that would BAN shale gas extraction, just weeks after a moratorium was lifted by the PM.
