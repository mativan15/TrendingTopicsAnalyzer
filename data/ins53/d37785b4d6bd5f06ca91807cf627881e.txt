Landec (NASDAQ:LNDC) said Thursday it sold all of its Curation Foods' assets related to BreatheWay packaging technology business for $3.2M in cash.
Net proceeds from the deal will be used to repay borrowings under LNDC's credit facility.
The results of BreatheWay operations will be reported as discontinued operations starting in Q1 of 2023.
Following the sale, LNDC's Curation Foods segment is now represented by its avocado products and olive oil & vinegar businesses.
Early in 2020, LNDC announced Project SWIFT to streamline its Curation Foods business, saying it would explore strategic alternatives for its legacy vegetable bag and tray business.
