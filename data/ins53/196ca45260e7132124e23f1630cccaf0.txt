Dusan Vlahovic scored the only goal as Juventus edged a cagey Serie A derby at city rivals Torino to claim a much-needed win.

Serbia striker Vlahovic turned home Danilo's assist to break the deadlock midway through the second half and ease the pressure on head coach Massimiliano Allegri.

Juve secured just their fourth league win of the season following back-to-back away defeats against AC Milan and Champions League group rivals Maccabi Haifa.
