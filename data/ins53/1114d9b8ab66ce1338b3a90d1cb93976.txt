New moons are often optimal times for beginnings or starting something anew. However, as Mercury retrograde strongly influences today's new moon, we'll need to go backward first to be able to move forward. Perhaps we'll have to revisit a plan, a specific conversation or some important paperwork before we can take the next steps toward a goal. Being intentional about the decisions we make will also ensure we're feeling confident and ready for what the future holds. Meanwhile, we're encouraged to tap into some of the lighthearted energy of Gemini season with some laughs or entertainment.
