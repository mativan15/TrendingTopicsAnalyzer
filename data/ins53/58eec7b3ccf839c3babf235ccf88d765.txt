The US Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked the Texas law that prohibits social media companies from moderating content based on a user's "viewpoint." The Supreme Court order came about three weeks after the so-called "censorship" law was reinstated by the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
"The application to vacate stay presented to Justice [Samuel] Alito and by him referred to the Court is granted," the ruling said.
