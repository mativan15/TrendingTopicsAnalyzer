After weeks of rumours and speculation, TV's worst kept secret was revealed on Monday, when Gemma Owen was unveiled as one of the contestants on this year's series of Love Island. The eldest child of former footballer Michael Owen teased that she will be "fun, flirty and fiery" throughout her stint on the ITV2 series, ahead of the addictive dating show returning to our screens on Monday 6 June. Speaking ahead of the launch next week, Gemma, 19, discussed things that give her "the ick" in relationships - confessing that bad hygiene and a potential partner who doesn't "look after themselves" are her turn-offs.
