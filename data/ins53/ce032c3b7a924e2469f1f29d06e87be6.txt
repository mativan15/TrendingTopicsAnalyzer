When Lily Meagher was two-years-old, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. She underwent chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery at Cincinnati Children's Hospital and beat the cancer. A year later it returned, she received proton radiation therapy, and beat it again. Every year for more than a decade, the now-13-year-old has raised money with a lemonade stand to help fight childhood cancer and give back to the people who she believes saved her life.
