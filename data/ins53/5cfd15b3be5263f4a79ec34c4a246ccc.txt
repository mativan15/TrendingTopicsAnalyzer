Mortgage rates inched closer to 7% this week, remaining at their highest point since April 2002 and driving more buyers and sellers from the market.The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage edged up to 6.94% from 6.92% last week, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have increased more than a full point since the start of September and are now more than double where they were at the beginning of the year.The rapid ascent, driven by the Federal Reserve's actions to rein in runaway inflation, has smothered buyer demand, while homeowners hunker down, unwilling to give up their current ultra-low rate.
