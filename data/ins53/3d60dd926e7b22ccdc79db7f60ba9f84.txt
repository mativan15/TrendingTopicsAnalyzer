West End bosses reacted with fury to the Chancellor's decision to perform a U-turn on the reintroduction of VAT free shopping for foreign tourists.They said it would deliver a 'hammer blow' to the recovery of London's shopping district and will pujt the capital at a disadvantage to rivals such as Paris and Milan in the run up to Christmas. Today's decision by Jeremy Hunt represents the third change of heart on the measure by successive Chancellors.Rishi Sunak originally axed the perk - which allows overseas visitors to claim back 20% on their purchases in the UK - in January 2021 when Brexit was implemented.
