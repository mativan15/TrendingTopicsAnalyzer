Ski Bromont is already a hive of activity. Backhoes cross-cross back and forth at the base of the mountain, moving mountain biking racks into storage for the winter. Stairs are removed in favour of ramps for the upcoming ski season. There are about 300 employees turning the site over from fall sports to winter, and over the next month, training will start for ski patrol and new employees, but owner Charles Desourdy says he's still scrambling to find new hires for the 1,200 positions he needs to keep the resort fully open.
