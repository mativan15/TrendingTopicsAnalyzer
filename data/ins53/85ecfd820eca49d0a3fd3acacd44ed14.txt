'Potentially hazardous' asteroid Phaethon's spinning period is decreasing by 4 milliseconds per year. Here‘s why. A potentially dangerous asteroid has left scientists' worried with its rising spin rate. The near-Earth asteroid Phaethon is spinning faster and faster. A recent study led by a team of researchers has detected the asteroid's rotational period is decreasing by 4 milliseconds per year. And it could affect Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's DESTINY+ mission launch. The spacecraft aims to fly by the space rock in 2028.
