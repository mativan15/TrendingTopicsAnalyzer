Tokyo shares closed higher on Tuesday as investors took heart from rallies on Wall Street, boosted by easing worries over corporate earnings. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index gained 1.42 percent, or 380.35 points, to 27,156.14, while the broader Topix index rose 1.16 percent, or 21.88 points, to 1,901.44. The dollar fetched 148.86 yen, against 149.03 yen in New York, where the Japanese unit hit another 32-year new low. "The yen remains under pressure despite desperate attempts by Japan to influence the currency markets through direct and verbal intervention," Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note.
