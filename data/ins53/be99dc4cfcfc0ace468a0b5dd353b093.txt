Martina Birnbaum APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) is a fairly large independent exploration and production company that operates in both the United States and abroad. This makes the company one of the unique independents as most of them only have domestic operations. The fact that the company is considerably larger and more diversified than many of its peers does not mean that it represents a poor opportunity, though. In fact, APA Corporation appears to be considerably undervalued at the current price despite the fact that investors have been more interested than usual in traditional energy names.
