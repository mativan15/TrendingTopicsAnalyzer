CALGARY — As world leaders prepare to head to Egypt next month for the 27th United Nations climate change conference, environmental groups are urging the Canadian government to move quickly to announce an aggressive cap on emissions from the country's oil and gas sector.

The Climate Action Network says it is afraid the federal government will "water down" its emissions cap in the face of industry pressure. It is calling on the government to unveil an ambitious cap on energy sector emissions with interim targets for both 2026 and 2030.
