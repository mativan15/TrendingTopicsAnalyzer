If Tuesday's home opener was any indication of what's to come, then this Ottawa Senators' season is going to be wildly entertaining.The Senators beat the Boston Bruins 7-5 at Canadian Tire Centre with seven different players scoring.Mark Kastelic's first of the season in the second period held up as the winner, but the fun started before the puck even dropped.Things got underway with former Ottawa captain Daniel Alfredsson on hand for the ceremonial puck drop sending the sellout crowd into a frenzy.
