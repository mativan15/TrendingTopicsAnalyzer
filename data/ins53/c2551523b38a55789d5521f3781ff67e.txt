Graham Potter has insisted N'Golo Kante's four-month injury lay-off will not affect any new contract talks with Chelsea.

Kante's latest hamstring problem requires surgery, ruling the France talisman out of the Qatar World Cup.

The World Cup-winning midfielder's Stamford Bridge contract expires next summer, and a string of hamstring and knee problems have ravaged his last three years in west London.
