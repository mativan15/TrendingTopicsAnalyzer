Check out the new pump track at Quidi Vidi Lake. Riders of all kinds were whipping around it at the track's official opening on Tuesday.There's a new way to go around — and around and up and down — Quidi Vidi Lake. The City of St. John's and the Avalon Mountain Bike Association officially opened a pump track on The Boulevard side of the pond on Tuesday. The track, located near the dog park, is a continuous loop of berms and mini-hills. Almost anyone on non-motorized wheels can use it — bike riders, skateboarders, wheelchair users, Rollerbladers and scooter riders.
