Liam Gallagher has revealed both his hips are ‘bashed up' but he'll wait until after his Knebworth gigs before getting a double hip replacement. 
The 49-year-old Oasis star – who has previously spoken about having arthritis which has affected his hips – joked that he'll still be doing ‘high kicks like Mick Jagger' at the concert next month. 
Appearing on The Zoe Ball Breakfast show, Liam said: ‘Hips, man, they're both bashed up, but I just went to get these injections the other day actually, so now I am buzzin' mate, I'm like Louie Spence… 
‘I might go and ruin my career at Knebworth and go and start doing some high kicks like Jagger, and everyone's going like that, 'I want my money back, we only come to see him stand still.
