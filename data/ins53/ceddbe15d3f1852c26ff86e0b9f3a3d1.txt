Mumbai: The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) is weighing a proposal to raise its investment limit in equities to as much as 25% of incremental flows from the existing 15%, said people familiar with the matter. The higher exposure to stocks is aimed at helping the apex retirement body bridge the shortfall in returns with investment in debt securities struggling to help it reach targets.The Finance Investment and Audit Committee met nearly two weeks ago to discuss the matter.
