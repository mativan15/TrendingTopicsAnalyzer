In a ghastly incident, a family of three succumbed to death after they set themselves ablaze in a suspected suicide pact at their residence in HSR Layout on Friday morning. The deceased have been identified as Santosh Kumar, 54, his wife Oman Santosh, 50, and their daughter Sanusha, 17. The family hails from Kerala and had been living in the city for over a decade now. The family had shifted to the house, in which they ended their lives on Friday, three months ago on rent and since then had been living in isolation and had not spoken much with their neighbours, police said.
