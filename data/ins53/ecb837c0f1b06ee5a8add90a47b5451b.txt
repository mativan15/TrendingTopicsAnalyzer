London Poppy Day which raises £1 million a year has been cancelled for the first time due to rail strikes.
The Royal British Legion (RBL) confirmed its event "will not go ahead as planned" on November 3 due to industrial action by the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union.
The RBL said it was now "urgently considering alternative arrangements to lessen the impact" from the loss of funds on its work with members of the Armed Forces community.
Up to 2,000 personnel, veterans and volunteers had been lined up to help with collections at 70 locations across London's tube and train stations, office blocks and out on the streets from 7am to 7pm.
