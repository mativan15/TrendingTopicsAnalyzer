(Bloomberg) -- A dreadful year for Chinese stocks became worse this week as expectations for stimulus measures at the Communist Party Congress were left largely unfulfilled.The benchmark CSI 300 Index fell 2.6% this week, taking this year's decline to more than 24%, while the yuan weakened as President Xi Jinping stood by his Covid-Zero policy, and stopped short of announcing any significant measures to bolster an ailing property sector. Meanwhile, officials spooked traders by delaying the release of key economic data.
