Justin Trudeau's office has defended the prime minister's household spending of $55,000 annually on groceries billed to the taxpayers.According to documents obtained by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, Mr Trudeau and his predecessor Stephen Harper list an average of $54,494 annually on 'miscellaneous food expenses' billed to the taxpayer after customary reimbursements.The PM's office said the household expenses are repaid to the government coffers based on a flat rate and not based on the price of each item, due to a policy which dates back to former prime minister Brian Mulroney.
