The New Zealand sharemarket snapped a three-day run of gains on Thursday but held up better than the Australian market. The benchmark S&P/NZX50 Index fell 0.2%, or 23 points, to 11,349.5, following a 0.5% gain on Wednesday. Australia's S&P/ASX200 Index was down 1% at 7157 in late afternoon trade, and US futures were negative. Forsyth Barr analysts said the index fell 4.8% last month, bringing its 12-month loss to 8.2%.
