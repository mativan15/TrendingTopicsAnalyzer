FlyExclusive this week announced it would follow Directional Aviation's Flexjet, Inc. and Wheels Up Experience onto the New York Stock Exchange with a SPAC merger. Its deal is with EG Acquisition Corp., which raised $225 million in its initial public offering in May 2021. The pre-transaction equity value of $600 million is expected to provide up to $310 million in proceeds. While it's easy to group the three private jet companies together, a visit to Kinston, North Carolina, where FlyExclusive is based and discussions with its Founder and CEO Jim Segrave, as well as other executives, make clear its reasons for becoming a publicly traded company are as different as chalk and cheese.
