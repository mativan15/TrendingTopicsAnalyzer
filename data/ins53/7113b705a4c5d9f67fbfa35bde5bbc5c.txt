The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). To wit, the Telstra Corporation Limited (ASX:TLS) share price is 11% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market decline of around 2.3% (not including dividends) in the same period. If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! The longer term returns have not been as good, with the stock price only 6.
