The first teaser of Abhishek Bachchan starrer Breathe: Into the Shadows season two was unveiled by the makers on Friday. From the look of it, it seems things will pick up from where the first season of the thriller concluded. The official logline of the series goes, 'The chase is on again. Only this time, it's not just a battle. It's psychological warfare.'
In the teaser, we meet Abhishek Bachchan's Dr Avinash who is once again ready to go to any lengths to save his family. Amit Sadh as Kabir is back to stop the murderer but if he would succeed or not, only time will tell.
