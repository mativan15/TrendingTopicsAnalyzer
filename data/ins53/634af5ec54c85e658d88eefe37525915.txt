Do you have any favorite internal affirmations or mantras you like to offer students to help them feel confident in the face of potential bullies or put-downs? I'm trying to help out my elementary schooler. Right now I'm thinking of sayings along the lines of 'I am awesome just as I am,' or 'I will not let others define me.' Additionally, if there are any great all-purpose verbal comebacks or responses that might be applied generally, those would be helpful and welcome as well. Really, I welcome any suggestions you have for helping my child muster up confidence (with kindness).
