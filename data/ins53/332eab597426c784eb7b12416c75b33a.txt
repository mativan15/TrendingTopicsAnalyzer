The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the United States Capitol is expected to sentence former Trump aide Steve Bannon on Oct. 21. 
Bannon, who was found guilty on two counts of contempt charges in July, could face up to two years in jail for his refusal to appear for a deposition and produce documents, despite subpoenas from the committee. 
Ben Teitelbaum, an expert on alt-right politics and professor of international affairs, has written several books about the rise of the alt-right movement and recorded more than 20 hours of interviews with Steve Bannon for his book War for Eternity: Inside Bannon's Far-right Circle of Global Power Brokers.
