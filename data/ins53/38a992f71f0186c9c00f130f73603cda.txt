The North Sea windfall tax will imperil government attempts to revive Britain's oil and gas industry, the boss of London's newest energy giant has warned.Meg O'Neill, chief executive of Woodside Energy, said the Treasury's energy profits levy was a 'red flag' showing that Britain was 'not a particularly conducive place to invest'.'If the government has aspirations of reviving the UK oil and gas sector, this is probably not the best way to do it,' she told The Times.O'Neill was speaking as the Australian group prepares to start trading its shares in London through a secondary listing today after the completion last week of its merger with the oil business of BHP to form a £30 billion giant.
