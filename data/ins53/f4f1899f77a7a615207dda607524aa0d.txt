Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of The Berkeley Group Holdings plc (LON:BKG) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value.

We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws.
