Tory MPs have started to endorse prospective prime ministers after Liz Truss's dramatic resignation on Thursday.

Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of backbenchers, confirmed the leadership contest will conclude by Friday, October 28. This will allow a new prime minister to be in office in time for the Medium-Term Fiscal Plan on October 31.

While no candidates having officially put themselves forward, MPs are already going public with their favoured contenders for No 10.
