Gotham Knights is not a Batman game. We know this because the Caped Crusader is killed – literally, terminally, inescapably  – in its opening reel. 
The in-game pretext for this is a thematic exploration of heroic legacy and what it means to the people – good and bad – left behind. The real-world subtext is much simpler: you know those Arkham games you loved? Well, this ain't one of them. 
Acknowledging the bat in the room so brazenly and so early on is a ballsy but risky move on the part of developers WB Games Montreal that never fully pays off.
