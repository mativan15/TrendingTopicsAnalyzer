Republican Senate contender Herschel Walker, whose campaign is engulfed in an evolving scandal after reports that he asked a woman to have two abortions, continued to bat down the allegations as a lie during one of the most anticipated debates ahead of the 2022 midterm election.

'That's a lie,' Walker said Friday night in Savannah, Georgia. 'I'm a Christian. I believe in life.'

The Daily Beast reported last week that popular former football player paid for a woman to have an abortion in 2009. The woman also told The New York Times that Walker tried convincing her to have a second abortion two years later, but she refused and gave birth to a son, who is one of Walker's four children.
