Love Island star Paige Thorne has spoken out about her split from Adam Collard for the first time, while also revealing she's back in touch with ex Jacques O'Neill.
It was recently revealed that the romance between Paige, 24, and Adam, 26, was over just months after they left the Love Island villa together, amid allegations that he cheated on the paramedic. 
Photos emerged of fitness trainer Adam with his arm around another woman inside a McDonald's after a night out. He was then pictured partying in Ibiza looking particularly close to another girl at a pool party.
