Benzinga's weekly Stock Wars matches up two leaders in a major industry sector with the goal of determining which company is the better investment. This week, the duel is between two leaders in the airline industry: Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE:DAL) and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK). The Case For Delta: This company has its roots in Huff Daland Dusters of Macon Georgia, which made history in 1925 as the world's first aerial crop-dusting company. Four years later, the company had a new name — Delta Air Service — and a new focus as a passenger carrier.
