Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's conglomerate Reliance Industries today reported a surprise drop in consolidated net profit for the second quarter against expectations of double-digit growth, hurt by the government's newly introduced windfall profit tax that hurt mainstay oil earnings. The bottomline fell 0.2% year-on-year to Rs 13,656 crore, missing ET Now poll of Rs 15,664 crore. The bottomline fell despite consolidated revenue rising nearly 34% on year to Rs 2.32 lakh crore. However, there are some key developments that happened in the second quarter ranging from beta trial for 5G services to Jio-bp working towards becoming the country's largest fast charging network.
