The comment came on Thursday, a day after a video emerged of the ruling BJP's supporters purportedly chanting 'death to Pradyot' at Ampinagar in Gomati district. The BJP and Motha, which rules the Autonomous District Council (ADC), are caught in a tussle over alleged financial misappropriation in the tribal council.
'Both BJP and TIPRA Motha activists are Tiprasa.
