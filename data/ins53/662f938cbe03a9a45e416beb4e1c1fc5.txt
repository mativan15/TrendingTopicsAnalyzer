(RTTNews) - The Australian stock market is slightly lower on Tuesday, giving up some of the gains in the previous three sessions, with the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 staying below the 7,300 level, despite the lack of cues from Wall Street overnight due to a holiday, dragged largely by technology and financial stocks. The losses were partially offset by gains in materials and energy stocks. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index is losing 12.60 points or 0.17 percent to 7,274.00, after hitting a low of 7,257.
