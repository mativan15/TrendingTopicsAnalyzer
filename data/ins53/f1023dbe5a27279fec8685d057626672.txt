Telangana Congress continued its tirade against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao accusing them of neglecting Telangana issues while trying to project their political agendas. Former PCC chief Ponnala Lakshmaiah said the entire episode reflects that PM Modi was more interested to promote BJP in Telangana while KCR was interested in pursuing his political ambitions.
