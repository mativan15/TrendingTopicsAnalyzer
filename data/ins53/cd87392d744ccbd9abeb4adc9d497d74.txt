Around 4,000 Salesforce staff have signed an open letter calling for the CRM giant to stop working with the National Rifle Association, the powerful US gun-lobby organisation.
The calls to senior management at Salesforce come in the wake of the 24 May school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, which left 19 children and two adults dead.
The letter sent to co-CEOs Marc Benioff and Bret Taylor, CFO Amy Weaver, and CMO Sarah Franklin has attracted more than 4,000 signatories, according to reports. "It's not in our power to get background checks or other gun control measures passed by Congress – but we can effect change by ending our commercial relationship with our customer, the National Rifle Association," the open letter said.
