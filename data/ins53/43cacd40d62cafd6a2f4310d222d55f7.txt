Amy Hart has shared her excitement to be halfway through her pregnancy with her first child – though she is already counting down the days until her baby is here.
The former Love Island star, 30, took to Instagram to give her fans an update on her pregnancy, sharing photos from her most recent scan.
She told her followers: ‘20 weeks of growing a human!! I'll be honest (as I always strive to be..) as much as this morning's scan was amazing, we saw so much (but covered our eyes at the right times so we didn't see the gender!) I feel a little bit deflated this evening…but for all the right reasons!
‘This last week I've been so so excited, the most excited I've been the whole time but I feel like I've been pregnant for aaaaggeess now and I've got to do the whole thing again and I just wanna have the baby here nowwww!!! (Veruca Salt vibes).
