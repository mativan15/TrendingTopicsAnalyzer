EXCLUSIVE: After receiving rave reviews from its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival which instigated a bidding war, Sony's Stage 6 Finnish feature Sisu has been scooped up by Lionsgate. The film will receive a theatrical release at some point in the future.

The movie is from filmmaker Jalmari Helander (Rare Exports, Big Game) and follows Aatami, an ex-soldier in 1945 who discovers gold in the deep wilderness of Finland while on his way into the city. Brutal Nazis on a scorched-earth mission discover his treasure trove.
