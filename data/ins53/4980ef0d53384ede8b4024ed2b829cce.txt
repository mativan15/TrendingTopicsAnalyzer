Service Merchandise was once one of Middle Tennessee's most successful businesses for decades until the changing retail landscape derailed it 20 years ago.

Originally called Shainberg & Zimmerman's Wholesale Company, Service Merchandise was founded in 1934 in Pulaski, Tennessee, by Harry Zimmerman. It was known for selling cosmetics, toys, glassware and other household items. It began as a family owned and operated wholesale business until the early 1960s. Zimmerman's eventually moved to 305-307 Broadway in Nashville as the business expanded.
