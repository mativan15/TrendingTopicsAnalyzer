The major-party candidates hoping to represent Pueblo in the Colorado Senate have a lot in common: they've been previously registered as members of the other party, have served in the military and are not originally from Pueblo.

Republican Stephen Varela is challenging incumbent Democrat Nick Hinrichsen for his seat at the Colorado General Assembly, which Hinrichsen was appointed to in February 2022 after Leroy Garcia left for a position at the Pentagon.

The race has garnered significant attention statewide.
