Published: 07:59 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 08:06 EDT, 18 October 2022 Liz Truss suffered a fresh body blow today as a poll found more than half of Tory members want her to quit, with Boris Johnson the favourite to take over. A bombshell YouGov survey revealed four in five party activists thought the PM was doing a bad job and 55 per cent were convinced she should go, compared to just 38 per cent who backed her staying. Her predecessor Mr Johnson was the preferred option as a replacement, with 32 per cent supporting him while 23 per cent said Rishi Sunak and 10 per cent Ben Wallace.
