PARIS — It started several weeks ago at refineries. Then it spread to nuclear plants. And finally, on Tuesday, railway workers, some teachers and even high school students across France, at least for the day, joined a snowballing strike that has become the biggest test so far of President Emmanuel Macron's second term.

The widening strike came on the heels of a large march against rising costs of living held in Paris on Sunday and increases pressure on Mr. Macon's government, which is already embattled in Parliament, where opposition parties are refusing to pass the budget.
