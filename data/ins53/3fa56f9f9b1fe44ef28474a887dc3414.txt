A cognitive behavioural therapist and mum-of-one has joined the ranks of people who have sworn off ever calling their children ‘naughty'. 
Navit Schechter, 43, has concerns that harshly berating kids will result in a generation of people-pleasing sycophants. 
Navit said that referring to your child as ‘naughty' or even ‘good' can have a big impact on their self-worth, and it might result in them becoming anxious and self-critical as adults.
The businesswoman who runs Conscious and Calm, which offers parenting courses, tries to steer people away from a good/bad binary.
