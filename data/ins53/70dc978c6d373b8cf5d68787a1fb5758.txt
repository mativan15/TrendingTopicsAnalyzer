Public hearings into the legislation are being held in Canberra from Tuesday to Friday. Labor senator Linda White is chairing the parliamentary committee with independent MP Helen Haines as deputy. Senator White said she wanted to hear as many voices as possible during the hearings, while Ms Haines said there had been strong community interest in the bill.
