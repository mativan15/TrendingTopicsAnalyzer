SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — How can Utah residents know if they're overwatering their lawns? 'Flip a coin,' says BYU Civil and Construction Engineering professor Rob Sowby, whose recent study suggests nearly half of Utahns are using too much water in an effort to keep their grass healthy. Using aerial photographs depicting lawns in two Utah County cities, then cross-referencing the data with secondary water bills from thousands of anonymous customers, Sowby's paper points to widespread overuse in the Beehive State.
