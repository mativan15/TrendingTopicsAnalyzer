‘Game is up' - Tory MP calls for Liz Truss to step down

Crispin Blunt has become the first Tory MP to call for Liz Truss to resign amid growing unrest within the party.

Amid the multiple U-turns on the Government's mini-Budget and following the sacking of Kwasi Kwarteng, Mr Blunt - who will step down at the next election - said he does not believe the Prime Minister can survive the current crisis.

Speaking to Channel 4's Andrew Neil Show, the MP for Reigate said: 'I think the game is up and it's now a question as to how the succession is managed.
