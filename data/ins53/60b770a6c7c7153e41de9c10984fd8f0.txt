Ryan Baudhuin, a combat veteran who uses his charity High Point Adventures to organize dream hunting trips for veterans struggling with returning to civilian life, poses with a championship belt he had made as the winner of the Wahl "Benevolent Beards" contest.

GREEN BAY – Already home to the best mullets in America, Wisconsin now has the most benevolent beard in the country. Arguably making the dairy state a "bearder" place to live.

Ryan Baudhuin of Wrightstown is the winner of the Benevolent Beards Contest which is put on by Wahl Clipper Corporation, a national hair and grooming company.
