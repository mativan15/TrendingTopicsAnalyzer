Five-star forward Elijah Fisher announced his commitment to Texas Tech on Thursday. Fisher, who also intends to reclassify into the 2022 class, will be eligible to play this upcoming fall. Fisher chose the Red Raiders over Kentucky, Louisville, and Memphis. Fisher was originally ranked as one of the top 15 prospects of the 2023 class. Texas Tech has now signed four freshmen for its 2022 class.
