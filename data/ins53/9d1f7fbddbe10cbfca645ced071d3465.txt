One of Donald Trump's political committees spent $158,000 on books just weeks after the release of Jared Kushner's memoir.
 'Breaking History: A White House Memoir' hit book shelves on Aug. 23. Two weeks later, the Save America Joint Fundraising Committee, which raises money for two Trump PACs, paid retailer Books-A-Million $131,000 for 'collateral:books,' according to a campaign filing made Saturday with the Federal Election Commission.
