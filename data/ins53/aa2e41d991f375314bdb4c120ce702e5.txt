It is an honour of a lifetime to have been asked by the Prime Minister to return to public service, as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
We fundamentally agree on the big task facing the country. If we want to put money into brilliant public services like the NHS, and keep taxes low, we've got to find a way of turbocharging growth.
At the same time, I understand that families across this country are finding life extremely tough right now. Worries about rising mortgage costs and energy bills have left people with an overwhelming desire for stability.
