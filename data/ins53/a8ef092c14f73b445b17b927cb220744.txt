VANCOUVER, BC, June 2, 2022 /CNW/ - It seems fitting that a tech start-up headquartered in a city that has seen the highest gas prices in North America this year, is introducing a new technology that allows consumers to optimize electricity usage for their cars, boats and homes right from their phones. As energy demands surge and people opt for more affordable electrical options, VoltSafe has developed a global solution that makes connecting to electricity much safer, greener and cheaper.

VoltSafe is the first in the world to successfully safety certify a high voltage, prongless plug technology that doesn't incur power transfer losses like other prongless technologies do.
