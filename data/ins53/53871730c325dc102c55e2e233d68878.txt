It looks like the Los Angeles Lakers may not be at full strength when they begin their regular season at the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday of next week.

Anthony Davis will not play in their final preseason game versus the Sacramento Kings on Friday because of lower back tightness. It is an ailment that had already caused him to miss two exhibition games.

But now the team has a new injury concern, as guard Dennis Schroder suffered a finger injury in its last game on Wednesday against the Minnesota Timberwolves.
