The markets are volatile right now because investors are concerned about inflation and rising interest rates, but the volatility is a great opportunity to find undervalued investments.

One value opportunity that's caught my eye recently is Getty Images (NYSE:GETY), a stock photo agency. The company was founded in 1995 by Mark Getty and Jonathan Klein and started with just one image. It now has an extensive collection of photographs, illustrations, video footage and audio clips that are available for purchase or license for commercial use.
