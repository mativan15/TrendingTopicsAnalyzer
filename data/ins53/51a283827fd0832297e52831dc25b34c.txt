May 27—TROY — A former Dayton man who was indicted with seven others in 2016 for trafficking heroin and methamphetamines pleaded guilty Wednesday in Miami County to nine felony indictments, including engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity.

Ricardo Mondragon, 32, whose last listed address was in Chicago, was arrested late last year by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in California while attempting to enter the country. Miami County Sheriff Dave Duchak said Mondragon was among a few hundred illegally entering the country when he caught the attention of agents, who matched him to warrants out of Miami County.
