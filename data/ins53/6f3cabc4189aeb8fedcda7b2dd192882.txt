(AP) - The New York Giants have the second-best record in the NFL at 5-1, and that's not the most promising thing about this club. While the record is unexpected after five straight losing seasons, what's more important is the players are marching in step with new coach Brian Daboll. The former Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator has taught the Giants how to compete, to be resilient, to never give up and then to forget everything and do it again the following week.
