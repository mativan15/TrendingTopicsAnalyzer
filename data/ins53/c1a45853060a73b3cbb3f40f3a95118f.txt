The pound rose against the dollar on the news of Prime Minister Liz Truss's resignation, before shedding some of the gains.

Sterling touched $1.13 at one point before slipping back.

UK government borrowing costs had been falling ahead of the PM's statement, but then began to edge back up.

One analyst said the reaction of the markets indicated they were "relieved" by Ms Truss's departure despite there still being a lot of uncertainty.

"Overall, the resignation of Truss is a step that needed to happen for the UK government to move further along the path towards restoring credibility in the eyes of the financial markets," said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
