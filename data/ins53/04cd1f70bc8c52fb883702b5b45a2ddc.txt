The backlash against Boris Johnson's potential return as UK Prime Minister is beginning to grow as a senior Tory figure said he has "had his chance". Sir David Lidington, the former Tory Cabinet minister who left the House of Commons in 2019, has warned against the former prime minister returning to Downing Street. He told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme: "I agree with my old boss Michael Howard, former party leader, who has said that Johnson had his chance as prime minister and we ended up with 60 - six zero - ministers and parliamentary private secretaries saying that they did not feel that they could remain in his government, that he was not fit to lead an effective administration.
