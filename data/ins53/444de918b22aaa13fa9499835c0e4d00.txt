Kolkata Police claimed to have seized at least Rs 2 crore in cash and a large amount of jewellery from a businessman's car at an upscale apartment owned by his brother in Howrah's Shibpur area in connection with a case of alleged online fraud.
The car belonging to Arvind Pandey was parked outside the apartment of his brother Shailesh Pandey at the time of the seizure , officials said.
Police said a Canara Bank regional manager on Friday lodged a complaint at Kolkata's Hare Street police station that some people had opened two accounts with the bank's Narendrapur branch in the name of companies with fictitious documents and made large online transactions.
