Will Mellor had the Strictly Come Dancing studio in tears after his emotional rumba with pro partner Nancy Xu.
The actor has had quite a week as he had just two days of training while battling illness, much to the concern of fans.
However, Will still gave his performance his all on Saturday night, dancing a moving rumba to The Joker and the Queen by Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift.
His performance honoured men's mental health and was dedicated to those who ‘put on a brave face' despite their struggles, as he wanted to spread an important message that it's ‘ok to not be ok.
