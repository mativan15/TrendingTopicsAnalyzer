Halloween is almost here, but the price of candy might be the scariest thing about the holiday. The cost of a bag of trick-or-treat sweets has shot up 13.1% since last year, according to the September 2022 Consumer Price Index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.That's the biggest year-over-year jump in candy prices since the CPI began recording it, NPR reported.Since August alone, the cost of candy bars and chewing gum has gone up 2%, thanks to supply chain issues and the increase in the price of sugar (up over 17%) and flour (risen more than 24%).
