MADRID (Reuters) - Spain abolished 33 aristocratic titles handed out by dictator Francisco Franco and his successor to loyal lieutenants and family on Friday as a new "Democratic Memory" law took effect.

The measure affects two of Franco's grandchildren, as well as the descendants of several of his top generals, ministers and other high-ranking officials.

Franco ruled Spain from 1939 to 1975 after leading a military coup against the Second Republic's elected leftist Popular Front government, which resulted in a three-year civil war that cost 500,000 lives.
