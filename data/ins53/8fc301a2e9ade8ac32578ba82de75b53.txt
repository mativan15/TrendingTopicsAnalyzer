House Republicans introduced a bill Tuesday to "stop the sexualization of children" on a national level.In a press release, Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) insisted that teaching children about "radical gender theory" below age 10 is sexualizing them and suggested that tax money should not be spent on such type of education. He and 32 other Republican reps all support the bill."The Democrat Party and their cultural allies are on a misguided crusade to immerse young children in sexual imagery and radical gender ideology," Johnson said.
