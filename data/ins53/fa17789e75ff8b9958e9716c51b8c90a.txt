Last year at this time, Jayron Kearse was just one of the new guys in the Cowboys secondary. Fast-forward twelve months, and he's become the guy.

The 28-year-old safety had fifteen starts for Dallas last year, more than he had amassed in his previous five NFL seasons combined. Along the way, he found himself taking over defensive playcalling duties from linebacker Micah Parsons midway through the season.

Now with a new two-year contract extension worth $10 million to go along with that neon green dot, Kearse sees his place on the team very differently.
