Days after the department of town and country planning (DTCP) cancelled the licence granted to Mahira Infratech Private Limited (formerly known as Sai Aaina Farms Pvt Ltd) for the development of an affordable housing colony in Gurgaon's Sector 68 citing 'grave violations' by the developer, the DTCP has recommended that the developer be restricted from demanding payments from homebuyers who have invested in its other projects till a final decision is taken.
On May 17, the DTCP had blacklisted the developer, its directors and other stakeholders for allegedly submitting forged and fabricated bank guarantees and forged signatures on collaboration agreements at the time of obtaining licence for the project in Sector 68.
