Published: 01:24 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 01:24 EDT, 18 October 2022 The New Jersey Devils have been slow out of the chute, so coach Lindy Ruff turned up the temperature heading into Tuesday's game against the visiting Anaheim Ducks. The Devils started the season with back-to-back 5-2 losses to the Philadelphia Flyers and Detroit Red Wings, prompting Ruff to put the Devils through a long fast-paced practice on Monday. "Practice with a purpose," New Jersey center Nico Hischier said afterward.
