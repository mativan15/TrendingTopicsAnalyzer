da-kuk Halting a two-day rally, stocks lost ground during Wednesday's session, dragged down by a spike in Treasury yields. Macro concerns resurfaced, offsetting the impact of a solid earnings report from Netflix. Among the leaders to the downside, shares of auto retailers were particularly hard hit. With signs of demand waning in the industry, Carvana (NYSE:CVNA), CarMax (KMX) and AutoNation (AN) all set new 52-week lows. This decline came in part due to data supplied by lender Ally Financial (ALLY), which fell to a new 52-week low as well.
