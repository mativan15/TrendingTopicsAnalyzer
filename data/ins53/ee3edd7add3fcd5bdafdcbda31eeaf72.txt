Five-time PGA Tour winner Kevin Na announced on social media Saturday he resigned from the PGA Tour before he headed to London to play in the inaugural tournament of the LIV Golf Invitational Series at the Centurion Club June 9-11.
The 19-year veteran wrote of his love for the PGA Tour and the opportunities it provided but the upstart league headed by Greg Norman and backed by Saudi Arabia, which features eight events this year with $255 million in prize money, 54-hole no-cut events and shotgun starts, was too much to pass up.
