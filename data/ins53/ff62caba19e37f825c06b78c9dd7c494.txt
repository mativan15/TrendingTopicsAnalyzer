Bournemouth interim manager Gary O'Neil, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: "It's a good point [but] it's a terrible penalty decision. I've been told that Jefferson [Lerma] is holding Mitrovic, but why Mitrovic falls backwards I have no idea. He pulls Jefferson over, otherwise you wouldn't fall that way. I think it's a terrible decision."The result is the result. I think the boys played extremely well. I'm just disappointed that [the penalty decision] cost them what they deserved."There's no disappointment with what our team produced today – zero – but when the game swings to 2-2 we need to go about it a different way.
