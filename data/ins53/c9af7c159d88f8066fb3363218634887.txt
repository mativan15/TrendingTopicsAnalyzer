Embracer Group now owns the rights to The Lord of the Rings video games, TV shows, and movies--among other mediums--and the company's CEO sees a lot of potential for growth in the area of games specifically. Lars Wingefors said at the Mipcom Cannes event this week that gaming will be Embracer's "strongest area of growth and monetization" for The Lord of the Rings.Embracer is among the largest video game companies on Earth by developer headcount, and this opens up possibilities that publishers at a smaller scale might not be able to accommodate, Wingefors said.
