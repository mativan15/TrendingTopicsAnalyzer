The New York Mets have not yet made history, but it smiles kindly upon them.

There's just no declaring a division winner on June 1, but every available metric – and the surrounding environment – suggests that the Mets' 34-17 start and the reinforcements on the way strongly suggest this National League East race is over.

It also doesn't hurt that their top competition has flailed to reach .500 and appear fatally flawed.

They are one of just seven teams since 1960 to forge a lead of at least 10 games by June 1, and all of those clubs won their divisions.
