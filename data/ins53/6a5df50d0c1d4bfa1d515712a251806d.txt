In the traditional 'take-make-waste' economy, materials flow in a linear way — from resources extraction to manufacturing and then to waste after usage. The automotive industry is responsible for a large share of resource consumption, especially steel, aluminum, plastic, rubber, and glass, among others.
The industry generates about five percent of industrial waste in the entire world,* and with increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs), battery material consumption grows significantly.
Circularity is the key in order to tackle the environmental challenges by maximizing the value retention throughout the entire life cycle of products and materials.
