The Māori Party and the National Māori Authority are backing calls for the establishment of an iwi bank to finance building on Māori land. It comes after Māori housing advocates told RNZ red tape and barriers at the bank were preventing whānau building on their own land. The Māori Party proposed an iwi-led bank in their 2017 election policy, under the leadership of Marama Fox. Almost five years later, co-leader, Rawiri Waititi said the party still backed the idea. 'An iwi-led bank would work because it would allow our people to have a lot more access to capital,' he said.
