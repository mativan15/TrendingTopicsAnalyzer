Over the last decade, the Tequila industry has seen a dramatic increase in volumes and revenues. Between 2011 and 2021, volume surged from 261 million liters to 527 million liters. Over this same period, the revenues generated by the Tequila industry grew by more than 150%. Concurrently, with the dramatic growth in the Tequila industry, has been even more explosive growth in Tequila-related tourism. The Tequila-producing zone in Mexico consists of the state of Jalisco, plus specifically delineated areas in the states of Nayarit, Michoacán, Guanajuato, and Tamaulipas.
