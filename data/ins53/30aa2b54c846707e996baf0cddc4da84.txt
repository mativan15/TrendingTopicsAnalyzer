It turns out being stalked by a hurricane feels just like the eve of the pandemic, when we knew a storm was coming but little else. Both are slow-moving disasters at the beginning. Both can cause great death and injury, or not. You can be devastated or passed by without a touch for the most random of reasons, or for no reason at all. Both can be quickly forgotten.

Remember the viral hits MERS or COVID-19's cousin SARS? Hurricane Bonnie in 1998 and, yes, 2022? Any of the three flu pandemics after 1918? Will Hurricane Ian make the cut like Andrew, Katrina, Ebola or AIDS?

Probably not.
