A 61-year-old man who authorities say verbally and physically abused women he had relationships with in Texas for more than 30 years was found guilty on Friday for the 2019 choking death of his wife in their North Richland Hills home.

A Tarrant County jury reached their verdict on a charge of murder against Victor Baxter, who according to court documents in 2019 told his wife, ''I am super pissed at you…there's no love in me for you… keep your wedding band off.'

Hours after he was convicted on Friday, jurors sentenced Baxter to life in prison.
