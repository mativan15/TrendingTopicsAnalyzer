BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union lawmakers refused on Tuesday to endorse the way the EU's border and coast guard agency used its 2020 budget, over concerns about serious misconduct by staff and human rights concerns involving Frontex's work.

Frontex supervises the 27-nation EU's outside borders. The agency is under pressure over allegations that it was involved in the illegal pushbacks of migrants, notably in the Aegean Sea between Greece and Turkey. Its executive director resigned earlier this year after an anti-fraud office probe.
