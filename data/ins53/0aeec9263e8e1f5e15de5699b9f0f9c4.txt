Iranian troops are 'directly engaged on the ground' in Crimea, supporting Russian drone strikes, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Thursday without providing evidence for the claim.'The information we have is that the Iranians have put trainers and tech support in Crimea, but it's the Russians who are doing the piloting,' Kirby elaborated, adding that only 'a relatively small number' of Iranian personnel had made the journey to Russia. He did not explain where the information had come from.
