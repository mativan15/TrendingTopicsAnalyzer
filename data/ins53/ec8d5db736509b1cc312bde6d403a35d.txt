A wild week of ups and downs continued on Friday in the cryptocurrency market but this time there were some positive moves, at least in stocks. Bitcoin (BTC -4.17%) was still down 3.5% in the last 24 hours as of 1:45 p.m. ET, but it's now down just 0.6% over the past week. A crash early on Thursday seems to have subsided. 
On the positive side, Coinbase Global (COIN 4.03%) shares jumped as much as 10.5% and are currently trading 4.4% higher for the day. Silvergate Capital (SI 3.21%), which is a crypto bank, climbed as much as 7.
