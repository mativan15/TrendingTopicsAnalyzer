Jerrekus Pendleton pushed and assaulted his ex-girlfriend as she held onto her son on the night of Oct. 4 at their Fort Worth apartment because he believed she owed him money for repairs after he wrecked her car, she told police.

On the morning of Oct. 5, Pendleton continued asking for money and after she repeatedly refused to give him money, he texted several threatening messages using emoji symbols, saying he was going to kill her family and her children at Oakwood Terrace Elementary in Euless, police wrote in an arrest warrant affidavit.
