The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) says people discovered the corpse of the victim, who hasn't been publicly identified, in the lake at John S. Taylor Park. Largo Police believe the man waded into the waters to retrieve frisbees. Reporters noted that there are no-swimming signs dotted around the park, which is near a disc golf course.
