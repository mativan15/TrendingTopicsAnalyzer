The big shareholder groups in Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) have power over the company. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don't tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.

With a market capitalization of US$17b, Steel Dynamics is rather large. We'd expect to see institutional investors on the register.
