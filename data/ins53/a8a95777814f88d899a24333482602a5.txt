A Raleigh pharmaceutical company executed a reverse stock split Monday to maintain its place on the Nasdaq.

Shares for the company, 9 Meters Biopharma (Nasdaq: NMTR), have traded below a dollar since early January, leading the company to fall out of compliance with a Nasdaq rule that establishes a minimum bid price. The stock split is intended to bring the company back into compliance as it moves its lead asset toward a phase 3 study.

The split will combine every 20 shares of 9 Meters stock into one, while largely not altering any stockholder's percentage interest in the company's equity.
