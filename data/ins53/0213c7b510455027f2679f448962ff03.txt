Lena Dunham said she is ‘upset' by the treatment of Don't Worry Darling director Olivia Wilde, which she believes can be ‘more intense' for women in the public eye.
The making of Don't Worry Darling became a source of global intrigue following Shia LaBeouf's departure from the film and Florence Pugh's perceived lack of public support for the project on her social media accounts.
Wilde herself became a tabloid fixture after she confirmed her off-screen relationship with Harry Styles, who replaced LaBeouf in the psychological thriller, before she was served with custody papers by her ex-partner Jason Sudeikis during a presentation about her film on stage at CinemaCon.
