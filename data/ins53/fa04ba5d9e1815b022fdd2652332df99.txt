Increased demand for plastics leads to a large amount of plastic manufacturing, which is accompanied by inappropriate disposal of plastics. The by-products of these waste plastics are microplastics (MPs; less than 5 nm in size), which are produced because of various environmental and physicochemical factors, posing hazardous effects to the ecosystem, such as the death of marine organisms due to the swallowing of plastic specks of no nutritional value. Therefore, the collection, preparation, identification, and recycling of these microsized plastics have become imperative.
