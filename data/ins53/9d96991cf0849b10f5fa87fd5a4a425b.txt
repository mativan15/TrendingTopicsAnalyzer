STATING THAT there is no material to attract offences of cheating, a sessions court recently granted anticipatory bail to ‘Matka Queen' Jaya Chheda in multiple cases filed by the Mumbai police crime branch.
The court said that if arrested, she will suffer ‘unnecessary harassment'.
Multiple FIRs were filed against Chheda across police stations in the city and the investigation was transferred to the Mumbai police crime branch. The police booked Chheda in over 10 cases in the past few months on charges including Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and the Maharashtra Prevention of Gambling Act saying that they want to probe her involvement in the running of Kalyan matka, one of the most famous lotteries in the state, but illegal as per the Gambling Act.
