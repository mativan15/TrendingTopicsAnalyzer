Wall Street's main indexes opened lower on Friday as Snap Inc's forecast of no revenue growth in the lucrative holiday quarter sparked a selloff in social media companies, with galloping U.S. Treasury yields adding to the losses. Meanwhile, a report on Federal Reserve officials to likely debate how to signal plans to approve a smaller increase in December limited the losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 42.4 points, or 0.14%, at the open to 30,291.18. The S&P 500 fell 8.7 points, or 0.24%, at the open to 3,657.
