New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has defended his appointment following the sacking of his predecessor, Kwasi Kwarteng.

Speaking on Saturday morning, Mr Hunt said he will 'have to make some very difficult decisions ahead' in order to balance the books.

Without being drawn on the detail of his future plans, Mr Hunt said some 'mistakes were made' over the mini-Budget, but overall, the long-term plan to improve growth was correct, he told Sky News.
