RON THE WAY Updated: 16:37, 16 Oct 2022MARCUS RASHFORD missed a last-gasp chance to take all three points for Manchester United in a disappointing 0-0 draw with Newcastle.
The Red Devils' attack lacked sparkle as Cristiano Ronaldo started at No9 and then threw a hissy fit as he was hauled off.
Joelinton hit the post twice in two seconds in the first half to give the Toon a huge chance to take the lead.
But the visitors also struggled to muster clear-cut chances and it was a case of defences on top.
