As climate change and rising sea levels put coastal communities around the world at risk, the United Nations is betting on technology to build resilient 'floating cities'.Oceanix, a 'blue tech' company based in New York, has designed a flood-proof pilot project it says could bring safety to millions of people.In partnership with UN-Habitat, the company is now ready to start building the first prototype in Busan, South Korea.Around 40 per cent of the world's population lives less than 100 km from the coast, and rising sea levels are threatening 90 per cent of mega cities worldwide, according to the UN.
