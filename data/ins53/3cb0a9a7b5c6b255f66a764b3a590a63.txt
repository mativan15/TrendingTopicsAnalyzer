Published: 19:42 EDT, 15 October 2022 | Updated: 19:43 EDT, 15 October 2022 New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has warned Britons of 'very difficult decisions' ahead as he attempts to restore trust in the Tories and balance the books.He's been accused of leading a 'silent coup' against Prime Minister Liz Truss on his first full day back in the job after taking an axe to her pledge to cut taxes to spur growth and conceding the Government went 'too far, too fast' with its mini-budget.The extraordinary reversal of Truss's policy platform came after the Prime Minister sacked her chosen Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, and U-turned on a second budgetary pledge to keep corporation tax low.
