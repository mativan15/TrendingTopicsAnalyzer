Almost a fortnight after the Congress organised ‘Chintan Shivir', a three-day brainstorming session to revive the party, workers in Himachal Pradesh on Thursday openly vented their ire against what they called lopsided appointments. Party workers claimed that leaders were enjoying power, while foot soldiers who struggled for the party over the years were ignored. There are 17 office-bearers in Pradesh Congress committee only from Jubbal and Kotkhai assembly segments. Himachal Congress chief Pratibha Singh had given prominence to Shimla district while making appointments for the Pradesh Congress committee.
