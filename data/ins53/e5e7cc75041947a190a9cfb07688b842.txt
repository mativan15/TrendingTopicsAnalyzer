Good morning. For the last three days, the National Rifle Association has been holding a macabre sort of pageant: a convention in celebration of guns in Houston, Texas, 200 miles away from Uvalde, where – last week – 19 children and two teachers were shot dead by a teenager. The NRA convention also coincided with the last of 10 funerals for the victims of the racist attack in Buffalo a fortnight ago.As the convention unfolded, and Donald Trump spoke, hundreds of gun control protesters made their voices heard outside.
