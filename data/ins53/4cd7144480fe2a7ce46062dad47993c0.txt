London Pride has come a long way since it was first staged as a protest in 1972 to commemorate the 1969 Stonewall Riots. While its core meaning remains the same, it's now a huge, colourful, joyous celebration of the LGBTQ+ community in the city. And it's good news for the parade's future, because London Mayor Sadiq Khan has just announced that Pride in London will be given a 5-year funding agreement adding up to £625,000. The money won't only go towards the annual Pride parade. It will also be used to set up a new community advisory council, form an anti-racism plan, create awards for LGBTQ+ achievements and establish better representation for the trans community.
