The Chicago Bears upgraded their cornerback room with the addition of rookie Kyler Gordon, who is expected to start on the outside opposite Jaylon Johnson.
While the Bears have certainty on the outside, the same can't be said for the nickel cornerback position, which is currently up for grabs. Bears cornerbacks coach James Rowe indicated that there's a competition at nickel brewing.
'There is some great competition right there,' Rowe said, via NBC Sports Chicago. 'Some great players there. Each of them have a little bit different things that make them special, so I'm excited to see how that turns out for us.
