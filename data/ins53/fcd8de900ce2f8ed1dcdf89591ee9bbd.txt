Eliza Walter has just dropped an extraordinary statistic. "Mining one ton of the earth's ore produces an average yield of under 30g of gold, whereas for a ton of e-waste, you would find 300g gold. Our landfill sites are hidden goldmines." Collectively, we throw away around 50 million tons of e-waste a year worldwide, so when put like that, it's a wonder that Lylie is currently one of the only jewelry brands working with precious metals exclusively salvaged from e-waste.
