Would you ride in a car made of fabric? You soon will, if a British start-up has its way.Arrival is the biggest, and most audacious, electric vehicle start-up you've never heard of. Its $13 billion listing on Nasdaq last year made it the largest-ever float for a British tech company.This month, executives travelled to the west coast of America to unveil its ride-sharing vehicle, which looks like a black cab but with bigger windows and a sparse interior that, as an Arrival employee explained, 'has less folds and creases', making it easier for drivers to hose down after a night ferrying around people in various states of sobriety.
