Jeremy Hunt warned public spending will be slashed as he vowed to 'make whatever tough decisions are necessary' to restore financial stability.
The new Chancellor said there were more 'difficult' choices looming in an emergency statement that reversed the disastrous mini-budget.
Speaking on Monday morning, he insisted Britain 'will always pay its way' after binning almost all the unfunded tax cuts that spooked markets.
Mr Hunt, now widely seen as de-facto Prime Minister, said all government departments would 'need to redouble their efforts to find savings'.
