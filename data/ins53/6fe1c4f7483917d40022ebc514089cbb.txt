The Oklahoma City Thunder announced on Saturday that they have signed guard Scotty Hopson and waived guard Adam Mokoka.
The Thunder signed Mokoka on Wednesday but did not appear in preseason for the team.
Hopson played in one game with the Thunder last season. In 32 games last season with the G League OKC Blue, Hopson averaged 13.5 points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.4 assists.
This move is likely to gain the G League rights of the 33-year-old and place him on the OKC Blue roster when their season begins in November.
