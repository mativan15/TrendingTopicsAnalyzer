A new Statistics Canada report says 18 per cent of Canadian businesses were impacted by cybersecurity incidents last year, compared with 21 per cent of Canadian businesses in both 2019 and 2017.

The data, which was collected from January to March 2022, shows 16 per cent of small businesses, 25 per cent of medium-sized businesses and 37 per cent of large businesses reported being affected by cybersecurity incidents in 2021.

Statistics Canada says the most common types of cybersecurity incidents identified by businesses were incidents to steal money or demand ransom payments and incidents to steal personal or financial data.
