As temperatures plummet, your heating bill will likely increase 5% to 10% this winter in Memphis.

'The energy market has been very, very volatile for months now,' explained Gale Jones Carson, a spokeswoman for Memphis, Light Gas and Water. 'That's not just in Memphis. That's across the country.'

According to a report from the Energy Information Administration, energy bills will increase across the country this winter. The agency predicts American natural gas users could pay 51% more than they did last year.
