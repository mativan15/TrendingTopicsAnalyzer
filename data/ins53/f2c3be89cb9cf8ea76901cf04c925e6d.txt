After so many rumours of multiple Silent Hill games, Konami itself is finally ready to announce something for the franchise.
From Hideo Kojima being involved to a remake of Silent Hill 2, for years there have been multiple and insistent claims of Konami reviving its Silent Hill franchise, and now it's been confirmed it is actually happening.
You're likely as sick of hearing about them as we are of writing about them. However, it looks like the rumour mill may finally end since Konami itself is teasing something Silent Hill related, to be revealed this week.
