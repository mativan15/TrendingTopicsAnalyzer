Coltrane was a fat man who liked to pretend there was no screaming thin man inside him. The bulk was important to him, an integral part of a noisy, combative personality, who contained more fractious spirits than the entire herd of Gadarene swine. His career waxed with his bulk.He put on weight seriously in the 1980s at the rate of a stone a year. He drank like a fish, chain-smoked and had a weakness for curries. He became a figure of indeterminate age and type; a forty-something whose features were lost among rolls of puppy fat, a middle-class Glenalmond boy who adopted the acerbic tongue of a corpulent Glaswegian thug and seemed to recoil in horror from the vulnerable 'arty-farty' inner man.
