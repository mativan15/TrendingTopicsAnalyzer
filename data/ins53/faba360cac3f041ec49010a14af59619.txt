May 28—Scorching temperatures might tempt visitors to seek comfort in the Kern River.

But under its glassy surface lurks deadly rapids and swells, prompting the Kern County Sheriff Office Search and Rescue team to issue its yearly reminder Friday to fight the lure of the "Killer Kern."

The KCSO Search and Rescue team added two deaths Friday to the total lives claimed by the Kern River. Since 1968, there have been 317 people who died from its treacherous waters.

Juan Carlos Villegas-Ornelas, 40, jumped into the river August 2021 and did not resurface alive.
