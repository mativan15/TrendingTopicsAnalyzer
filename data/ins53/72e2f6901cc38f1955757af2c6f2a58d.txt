(Bloomberg) -- FIFA, world football's governing body, rejected recent bids for the television rights to the 2023 Women's World Cup as too low and challenged broadcasters to offer better value.'This is not a case of being priced out, but rather testament to a lack of willingness of broadcasters to pay what the women's game deserves,' Romy Gai, FIFA's chief partnerships and media officer, said in an interview. FIFA has already turned down offers to broadcast the tournament in Italy, Germany, France and the UK and expects a similar outcome in Spain, Gai said.
