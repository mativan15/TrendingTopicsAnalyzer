American Tech giant Apple is working on a dock for the iPad that would allow the device to function as a smart display and speaker, reported The Verge. As per the outlet the update was shared by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman who stated that the company plans on introducing the capability as soon as next year, converting the iPad into an Amazon Echo Show-like device that you can set atop a counter or nightstand. Amazon already does something similar with its Fire tablets, as the company lets users place the devices into a charging dock to prop them up like a smart display.
