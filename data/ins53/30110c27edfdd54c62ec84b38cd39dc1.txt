alacatr/iStock via Getty Images Kilroy Realty (NYSE:KRC) shares are slipping 2.0% in Tuesday morning trading after BMO Capital Markets analyst John Kim downgrades the stock to Market Perform as the office REIT sector appears headed for a slowdown. "With the Fed raising rates to combat inflation, public and private markets have reassessed valuations, particularly for high-growth companies with questionable profitability," Kim wrote in a note to clients. Kilroy (KRC) has significant exposure to tech tenants, representing 56% of rent, the analyst pointed out.
