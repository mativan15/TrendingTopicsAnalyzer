It's about time for the Longhorns' late October trip to Stillwater, and it figures to be a spooky scene. No. 20 Texas faces No. 11 Oklahoma State in a crucial battle for both teams.

Spencer Sanders has underperformed based on his own standards over the last two games. The veteran quarterback completed just 44% of his passes in a loss against TCU last week. The week before, Sanders posted a 48.9 completion percentage at home against Texas Tech.

Clearly, the Oklahoma State signal caller is not his usual self.
