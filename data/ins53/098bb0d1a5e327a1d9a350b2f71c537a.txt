Jeremy Hunt, widely seen now as the most powerful figure in Government, used a series of broadcast interviews on Saturday morning to signal that Ms Truss's immediate economic plan is now defunct as he suggested that tax rises could form part of a painful fiscal package designed to restore market confidence in the UK. Mr Hunt, a former foreign secretary, was parachuted into Number 11 to replace Kwasi Kwarteng in a bid to restore order to Ms Truss's ailing administration. In his first full day in office, he warned of "difficult decisions" to come as he suggested that taxes could rise and budgets - including on health and defence - would likely be squeezed further in the coming months.
