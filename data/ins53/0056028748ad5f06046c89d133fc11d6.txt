Former and current FBI agents are fuming about Director Christopher Wray's use of the FBI's private jet, which originally was intended by Congress only to be used for counterterrorism purposes. 
A lot of other Americans would like to know why Wray cut short a Senate oversight hearing on Aug. 4 to fly in the FBI jet to his family holiday destination in the Adirondacks, after telling Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) that he had 'business' to attend to. 
Republican members of Congress sent a formal letter to Wray on Aug.
