Chelsea star Marc Cucurella could have the perfect chance to make a solid impression on Graham Potter's team with Reece James set for a spell on the sidelines. AC Milan technical director Paolo Maldini called the Spaniard a 'reserve left-back' during the week, despite his massive summer price tag. Cucurella was snapped up by the Blues after a lengthy transfer saga that initially saw Manchester City send inquiries. Not pleased by the asking price, Pep Guardiola's side walked away but Chelsea stuck around to cough up a huge £63million fee.
