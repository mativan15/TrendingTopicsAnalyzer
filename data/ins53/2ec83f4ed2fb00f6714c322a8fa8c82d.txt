Kristen Hall is returning to CBS Studios as EVP of communications. She succeeds in the top studio PR job Lauri Metrose who left in June after two decades. Hall, who is coming from Amazon Studios, was considered the lead contender for the job as she has a long history at CBS Studios, including a stint as Metrose's #2. 

	In her new role, which reports to Chris Ender, EVP of communications for CBS, and works closely with David Stapf, president of CBS Studios, and his creative and business teams, Hall will oversee all publicity and communications strategies for the studio.
