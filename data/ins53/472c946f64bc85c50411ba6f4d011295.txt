Bank of America executives focused on the Charlotte company's growth in consumer activity on their third-quarter earnings call with analysts today, highlighting year-over-year gains in deposit balances and lower credit delinquencies.

The bank's CEO, Brian Moynihan, said on the call that he wouldn't solely credit inflation as the reason for growth in consumer spending. He said transactions year over year are up by the single digits on a consistent basis.

'An analyst might wonder whether the talk of inflation, recession and other factors could rectify in a slower spending growth,' Moynihan said.
