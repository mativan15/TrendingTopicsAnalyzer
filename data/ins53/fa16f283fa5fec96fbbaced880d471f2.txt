STORY: The series follows two buddies, Nick and Tushar, who have rented out an expensive villa for their vacation. But everything changes when Tushar is suddenly sacked from his job, and the duo sublet the villa to earn money and continue to live opulently. Will they ever be caught? REVIEW: Most of us have already seen digital content creator Nikunj Lotia's, popularly known as Nick (of Be YouNick Youtube channel), previous work, so this series is essentially an expansion of that. ‘Apna Villa' is a light-hearted show with five episodes that last about 15-20 minutes each.
