Plotters in Tory are figuring out how to take Prime Minister Liz Truss out over turmoil in the economy, and it could make her the shortest-serving Prime Minister in Britain. The previous shortest-serving PM was George Canning, who died from tuberculosis after being in office for just 119 days in 1827. Three MPs, Jamie Wallis, Andrew Bridgen, and Crispin Blunt, have gone public and want her to resign so far.

Practically, it would be difficult as there is a ban on MPs to oust Liz Truss politically.
