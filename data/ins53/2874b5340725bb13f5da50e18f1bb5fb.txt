Suddath has partnered with the University of North Florida to launch a Logistics IT Solutions Lab at the UNF Coggin College of Business, with a grand opening ceremony held last week.

The UNF and Suddath Logistics IT Solutions Lab aims to enhance the learning experience of students enrolled in the Transportation and Logistics program, providing simultaneous live-data feeds across multimodal transport systems including road, rail, sea and air.

'We are extremely fortunate to partner with The Suddath Companies to offer this new state-of-the-art technology lab within our College's Transportation and Logistics program,' said Richard Buttimer, dean of UNF's Coggin College of Business in a release.
