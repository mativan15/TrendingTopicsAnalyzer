You don't become the richest man in the world by listening to what mom says. Or at least that's the case for Elon Musk.
The tech magnate — who is worth a comfortable $229 billion — owns Tesla Motors and SpaceX, but in recent weeks he's been flirting with the idea of adding Twitter owner to his resume.
Now, his mother, Maye Musk, weighed in on his decision to sign on the dotted line for the social media app, revealing her input doesn't have too much of an effect on her son's decision-making process.
