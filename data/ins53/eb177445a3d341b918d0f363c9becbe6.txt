Jaguar Land Rover is now reportedly considering shifting its electric car production to Slovakia unless UK ministers offer taxpayer support for a UK gigafactory. Tata Motors, which produces the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), is currently in talks with foreign battery makers Northvolt and SVolt Energy Technology to assemble their range of electric vehicles overseas.The UK currently lacks a major electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant, and the loss of a major carmaker could signal doom for the country's automotive industry.
