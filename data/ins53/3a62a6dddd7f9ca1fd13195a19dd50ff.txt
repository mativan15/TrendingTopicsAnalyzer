The dysfunctional truck scanner and inadequate X-ray machines used for locating hidden arms, ammunition, explosives, detonators, fake currency and narcotics, at the Attari integrated check post (ICP) continue to be a big concern for the Indian traders. Recently a delegation of the traders led-by ICP chamber of commerce president Anil Mehra met Minister of State in Ministry of Home Affairs, Ajay Mishra and apprised him of the difficulties they have been facing while trading due to the dysfunctioning of the truck scanner and inadequate X-ray machines.
