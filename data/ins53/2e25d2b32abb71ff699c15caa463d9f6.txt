Biden administration officials are considering subjecting some of Elon Musk's ventures, including his planned acquisition of Twitter Inc., to national security reviews, according to a new report. Bloomberg News reported late Thursday that some U.S. officials have become concerned in recent weeks by Musk's Russia-friendly tweets and his threat to cut off Starlink satellite internet service to Ukraine. The Tesla TSLA, -6.65% and SpaceX CEO's pending $44 billion acquisition of Twitter TWTR, +1.18% has also reportedly drawn concerns because of its foreign investors, including a Saudi prince, Binance Holdings — a crypto exchange that was initially based in China — and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund.
