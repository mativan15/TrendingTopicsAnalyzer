The Peripheral is debuting on Amazon's Prime Video tomorrow as yet another way to understand the implications of the metaverse. The television series is based on The Peripheral, a novel by William Gibson, who — before Neal Stephenson coined the term 'metaverse' in 1992 with Snow Crash — gave us the term 'cyberspace' in his short story Burning Chrome (1982) and his first novel Neuromancer (1984).
