For a project virtually constructed and directed over Zoom, there isn't a more appropriate name for the film Zero Contact. Produced in 17 different countries during the global pandemic, Zero Contact is a thriller that focuses on the dangers of high-tech in a virtual world. Anthony Hopkins (The Silence of the Lambs) stars as Finley Hart, an unconventional genius behind a global data-mining program. When Hart suddenly dies, five strangers are digitally called upon to continue Hart's work, which is an initiative that involves time travel.
