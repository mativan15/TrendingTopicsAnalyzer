Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has hit out at competitor Apple in a not-so-subtle Instagram post slamming Apple iMessage's supposed lack of privacy compared to that of the Meta-owned WhatsApp.

Zuckerberg posted an image of a new Meta billboard at New York's Penn Station that shows a blue bubble typically seen in iMessages, a green bubble below of the kind one would typically get with iPhone-to-Android communication, and a separate WhatsApp-style 'Private' bubble below it, implying that WhatsApp is the superior messaging system.
