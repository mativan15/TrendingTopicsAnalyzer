A golfing experience soon to come to downtown Boston is nothing like the bucolic nature of the game that enthusiasts often love when it's played outdoors.

Five Iron Golf will open this fall between City Hall and the Old State House, combining golf with a bar and the food offerings someone might find at a typical downtown restaurant.

It will fill 15,000 square feet. There will be 13 golf simulators that mimic more than 200 courses, as well as also be a full-service bar, a food menu, TVs, shuffleboard courts and Golden Tee arcade games, and lounge areas with neon signs and murals from local artists that will give it a far different feel than anything a golfer will see on a course.
