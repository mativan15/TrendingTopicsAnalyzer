As a longtime former NBA point guard, Tyronn Lue knows how to evaluate the position he once played. And he has not yet decided, he said, whether incumbent Reggie Jackson or John Wall will be the starting point guard when the Clippers ' season begins Thursday.

His comments before a Sunday scrimmage at the team's practice facility came one day after Yahoo Sports reported that Jackson was expected to earn the starting nod. Lue said he hasn't made that call yet and that the report 'didn't come from me.
