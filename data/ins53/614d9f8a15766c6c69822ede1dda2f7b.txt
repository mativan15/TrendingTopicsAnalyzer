A California man pleaded guilty in federal court to scamming 19 victims, including romantic partners and financial institutions, out of as much as $1.5 million in a scheme that involved lying about being a successful businessman and a former Navy SEAL, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Monday. Ze'Shawn Stanley Campbell, 35, scammed his victims over a period of six years from April 2014 to April 2020, convincing them he was a millionaire who owned several successful businesses, including McDonald's franchises, a gym chain in Texas and a security company, the DOJ said in a news release.
