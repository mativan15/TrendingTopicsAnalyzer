There's almost too much for Ye Olde Mailbag this week and I actually got this finished off while watching that never-ending ball game and the great Guardians finish on Saturday night.

Well done, folks.

Q: Hi Doug,

Recent reports suggest the NBA is contemplating expansion, with Seattle and Las Vegas mentioned as most likely locations. This would create an imbalance between the 2 conferences. Here are some realignment/expansion questions:

1) Who do you see as the team most likely to move from the west to the east?

2) Are there any teams that may be in danger of relocating due to attendance or other factors? New Orleans, Atlanta and Charlotte all seem possible.
