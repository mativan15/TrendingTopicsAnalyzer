A family of four has been forced to shower once a week in an attempt to keep their energy bill down. The cutbacks highlight measures families across the UK are taking to survive some of the toughest living standards in 40 years driven by rising inflation, the war in Ukraine and increased food costs. The Atmane family from Fulham, south west London, said the pressures of the cost of living crisis have become extremely difficult following the difficult pandemic. Mother of teenage girls aged 13 and 14-years-old, Zahia Atmane said they can only afford to buy essential food and rely on a local food bank - Dad's House.
