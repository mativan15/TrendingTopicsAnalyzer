Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower Friday, as rising bond yields reinforced expectations of an economic slowdown while U.K. political turmoil continued.

At 02:00 ET (06:00 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.9% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.5%.

European equity markets are expected to follow the lead from the U.S. after the negative close on Wall Street Thursday and the losses in Asia overnight.
