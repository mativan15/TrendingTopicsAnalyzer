Four defendants were sentenced Thursday for their roles in a deadly southern Dakota County burglary last year.

Nicholas Alan Taylor, 30, of St. Paul, was sentenced to 21 years in prison on a second-degree murder conviction in connection with the death of 55-year-old Chris Jon Lafontaine at Lafontaine's home in Greenvale Township in July 2021.

Taylor's girlfriend, Ryann Elizabeth Smith, 23, of White Bear Lake, received 80 months in prison after being convicted of aiding and abetting first-degree assault.
