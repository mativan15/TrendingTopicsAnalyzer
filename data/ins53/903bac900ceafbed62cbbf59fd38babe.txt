Broad was the only bowler to take a five-wicket haul in Australia last winter but his performances did not demand selection for the Caribbean. He averaged 39 in 2021, his worst since 2008, and struggled with injury, sustaining a serious calf tear while preparing for the Lord's Test against India that kept him out of the rest of the summer.
Broad and Anderson's stock rose in their absence in the West Indies and both do appear to be enthused by the new management of the team. Broad has taken time to review his performances and even vowed to bowl a bit fuller if the situation demands, which will perhaps bring a wry smile from Joe Root who criticised his lengths after the Adelaide Test.
