Aloha Poke Co., a Hawaiian-style fast-food chain, has opened its ninth Chicago-area location this week and plans to open another location by year-end.

Aloha Poke opened a 1,400-square-foot location at 916 N. Elmhurst Road in Mt. Prospect.

It plans to open another 1,400-square-foot location at the Deerfield Shoppers Court, located at 656 Deerfield Road in Deerfield, by December, Chris Birkinshaw, CEO of Aloha Poke Co., told the Chicago Business Journal.

The Chicago-based restaurant company already has a strong presence in the area and now seeks to expand its local presence even more.
