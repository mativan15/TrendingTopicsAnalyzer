Around 95% of surveyed 'digital nomads' have said Indonesia is their 'top of mind' destination for remote work and they are ready to travel, Tourism Minister Sandiaga Uno said in an interview with Bloomberg Television's Yvonne Man and Rishaad Salamat on Monday.

The ministry has mulled this special visa since early 2021, but the plan was derailed by coronavirus resurgences, stringent border controls and a lack of flights to Indonesia's tourist destinations.
