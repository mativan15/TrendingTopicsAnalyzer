Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin thinks that the stablecoin collapse needs a back-to-basics approach for future success and confidence.He touted "principles-based thinking" in a blog post entitled "Two Thought Experiments to Evaluate Automates Stablecoins" published Wednesday. Buterin also cautioned that expecting the broader cryptocurrency market to continue to notch limitless growth is detrimental."In general, the crypto space needs to move away from the attitude that it's okay to achieve safety by relying on endless growth," he wrote.
