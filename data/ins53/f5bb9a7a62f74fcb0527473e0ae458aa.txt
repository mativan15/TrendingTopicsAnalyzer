Investing.com-- Most Asian stock markets fell on Wednesday, with China-exposed equities tumbling further as markets fretted over a potential economic slowdown in the country due to its zero-COVID policy and more U.S. curbs on trade.

China's bluechip Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 index fell 1% while the Shanghai Composite index lost 0.7%, with both indexes extending losses into a third consecutive session. Uncertainty over the country's economy grew this week after the government indefinitely postponed the release of key third-quarter economic data.
