China's ruling Communist Party will hold its key Congress from October 16, 2022 during which a new set of top officials will be appointed except for President Xi Jinping who is set to get endorsed for a record third term, breaking over the three-decade norm for top leaders to step down after a 10-year tenure.The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), in which 2,296 'elected' delegates under the norms and guidelines set by Xi will attend a closed-door meeting, is being held amid a rare protest against Xi and his rigid Zero COVID policy of widespread restrictions and lockdowns, resulting in the slowdown of the world's second-largest economy.
