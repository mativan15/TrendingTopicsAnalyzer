Meghan Markle has torn into her time as a ‘suitcase girl' on Deal or No Deal.
The Duchess of Sussex, 41, reflected on her big break into showbusiness, long before she became Rachel Zane in Suits and later wed the most eligible bachelor in the world, Prince Harry.
Chatting to Paris Hilton on her latest Archetypes podcast episode, Markle said she was ‘grateful' for the opportunity on Deal or No Deal back in 2006 but she was ‘treated like a bimbo'.
Subsequently, she is determined to make sure her daughter Lilibet aspires to be ‘slightly higher'.
