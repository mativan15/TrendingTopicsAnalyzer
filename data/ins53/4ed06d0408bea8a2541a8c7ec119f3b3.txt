Oct. 21—MOSES LAKE — Skylar McKinsey is one of the reasons over 200 people gathered in the 4-H Building at the Grant County Fairgrounds last Saturday for an event that raised $42,500 for Youth Dynamics.

"Youth Dynamics is where kids get together and we all can have fun times together, or play games or offline games," the 13-year-old McKinsey said.

It's not just that, he said. It's also the summer trips — time in the wilderness, away from the world, going down a river or hiking or, as McKinsey noted, riding an inner tube down a huge hill.
