Russia is sending soldiers to the war in Ukraine despite many of them being untrained and unprepared for the fighting, a Russian Prisoner of War (POW) said. 
Speaking in an interview with The Guardian, a 21-year-old Russian serviceman identified only as Anton said members of his unit were sent to Crimea in late December to partake in a 'one-week' training course. Anton said they were not made aware that they were being deployed to the war until the night before the invasion started on Feb. 24. 
'Many of the young guys couldn't even imagine that we would go to war.
