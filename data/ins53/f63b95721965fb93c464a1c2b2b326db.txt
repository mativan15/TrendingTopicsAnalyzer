BRITS could be given more money for using appliances outside of peak hours after the National Grid raised the discount it will offer. 
The discount for avoiding using energy during off-peak hours has been increased from 52p per kilowatt hour to £3 - meaning households that use their washing machine at night could make typical savings of £100 this winter during the Cost of Living crisis.
The news comes as the electricity system operator warned Brits could face three-hour blackouts during the coldest days of the year.
