T﻿homas Duncan, BBC Sport ScotlandT﻿his was about as routine as it gets for Celtic. They could have been out of sight by half-time, with Kyogo guilty of passing up two good opportunities.A﻿fter a recent spell of missing chances, that's now 10 goals in two games for Ange Postecoglou's side, and a first clean sheet in nine games.M﻿att O'Riley is growing into the Callum McGregor role, and Reo Hatate is playing brilliantly alongside him in midfield. Kyogo getting on the scoresheet again is also a boost.
