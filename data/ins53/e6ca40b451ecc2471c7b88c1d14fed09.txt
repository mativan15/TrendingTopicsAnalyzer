The Indianapolis Colts will be without star running back Jonathan Taylor once again, as he is set to miss Sunday's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

The Colts officially ruled Taylor out as he continues to recover from an ankle injury.

Taylor was already forced to sit out Indianapolis' Week 5 matchup against the Denver Broncos on Thursday Night Football because of the injury he suffered in the team's loss to the Tennessee Titans.

The NFL's leading rusher in 2021, Taylor is the focal point of the Colts offense, but he's gotten off to a slow start this year.
