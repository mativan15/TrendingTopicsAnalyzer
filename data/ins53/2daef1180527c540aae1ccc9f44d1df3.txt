A coalition of more than 20 advocacy groups are urging Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to call a vote on a bipartisan antitrust bill that aims to limit tech giants from preferencing their own products and services over rivals. 
'This is an opportunity to pass legislation that will immediately result in a concrete increase in competition in an industry that touches the lives of every American, and we must not pass it up. We are pleased that you intend to bring [the American Innovation and Choice Online Act] to the floor, and urge you to act as quickly as is practical,' the groups wrote in a Thursday letter, according to a copy first provided to The Hill.
