Cloud-native architectures have changed the way applications are deployed, but remain relatively uncharted territory for high-performance computing (HPC). This week, however, Red Hat and the US Department of Energy will be making some moves in the area.
The IBM subsidiary – working closely with the Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore, and Sandia National Laboratories – aims to develop a new generation of HPC applications designed to run in containers, orchestrated using Kubernetes, and optimized for distributed filesystems.
