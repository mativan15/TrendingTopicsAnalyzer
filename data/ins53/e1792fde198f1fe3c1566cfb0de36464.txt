ALBANY — New York lawmakers are buttressing the state's abortion laws and providing stronger legal protections for service providers ahead of the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade.The Democrat-led Legislature gave final approval this week to measures that will protect abortion providers from extradition, arrest and legal proceedings in other states, and bar medical misconduct charges for performing reproductive health care.'We want to make sure that doctors aren't criminalized and that there's no criminalization of abortion here,' Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said Wednesday.
