Russian lawmakers Monday called for the toughening of a strict anti-gay law and the Kremlin ordered expensive patriotic education projects as Moscow presses with a conservative drive at home while its troops fight in Ukraine.The lower house of the Russian parliament, the Duma, held a consultation session on amendments to the 2013 law that bans exposing minors to what authorities deem "gay propaganda."The draft bill would take it further by also banning the "denial of family values" and the "promotion of non-traditional sexual orientations" to all ages.
