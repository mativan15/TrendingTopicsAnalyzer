AgenciesRBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has already said the possibility of another hike at the June review is a "no-brainer".With inflation remaining at elevated levels, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may gradually increase the benchmark lending rate to about 5.75 per cent by the end of this fiscal, chief economist Saugata Bhattacharya said on Thursday. He also said RBI may undertake front loading of interest rate hikes to tame inflation which have been over the central bank's tolerance level for the past 4 months.
