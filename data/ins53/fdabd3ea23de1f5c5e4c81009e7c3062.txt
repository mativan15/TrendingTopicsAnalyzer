Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday called on Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj, head of the erstwhile royal family of Kolhapur in Maharashtra, whose son Sambhaji Chhatrapati recently withdrew from the Rajya Sabha poll race. The meeting comes a day after the 74-year-old royal family scion told reporters that before pulling out of the June 10 Rajya Sabha election and announcing a new political outfit, his son had met former state chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.

"If he wanted to be an independent candidate for the Rajya Sabha, he should have met all leaders of the (ruling) Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA-comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) in Maharashtra, and if he was sure of his win, he shouldn't have announced a new political outfit," Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj said.
