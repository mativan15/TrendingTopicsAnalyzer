MIAMI — NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service will carry all 64 World Cup matches in the United States with Spanish-language commentary, including the first 12 for free from Nov. 20-23.

The 52 games from Nov. 24 through the final on Dec. 18 will be on the Peacock Premium tier, which charges a fee, NBCUniversal said Tuesday.

NBCUniversal's Telemundo Deportes, part of Comcast Corp.'s holdings, owns U.S. Spanish-language television rights, while Fox controls U.S. English-language TV rights.

Andrés Cantor is Telemundo's chief commentator and will be joined by Miguel Gurwitz, hosts Ana Jurka and Carlota Vizmanos, and former Mexico striker Carlos Hermosillo.
