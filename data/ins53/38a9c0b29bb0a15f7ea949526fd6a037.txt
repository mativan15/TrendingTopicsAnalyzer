IVOW AI symposium at Morgan State University in Baltimore, MarylandTogether with our team, I have made the very difficult decision to end IVOW AI. We are immensely proud of the impact of our work in this space, and of the joint efforts that went into the realization of our research and case studies. We weren't able to take this work to the next level, but perhaps you can. If you are in the field of AI, please continue to ask: Whose culture does Artificial Intelligence (AI) represent and which human needs does it prioritize?Our value proposition was clear:In order to build and support intelligent AIs that are more culturally-aware, we need to provide a source of data to develop, train, and test with.
