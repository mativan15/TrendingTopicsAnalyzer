Jordan Peele's Nope is full of unexpected elements—including an alien that doesn't look or act the way anyone thinks it will, and human characters who surprise us almost as much. One of the film's biggest breakouts is Brandon Perea (The OA), who plays UFO enthusiast Angel Torres; ahead of Nope's arrival on Blu-ray next week, io9 got a chance to ask him about his experience. Angel enters the story as the Fry's Electronics clerk who helps siblings OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) and Emerald (Keke Palmer) install the camera equipment they suddenly need to capture what they suspect is an alien lurking over their ranch.
