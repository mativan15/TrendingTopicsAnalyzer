Somewhere along the motorway, as we were being driven away from our old life and towards a new one, the police officers stopped using our old names. They had asked one of my sons something mundane – about which fast food restaurant he wanted to stop at – but called him by his new, unfamiliar name. I burst into tears. We were people who no longer existed in the back of an unmarked police car – no phones, bank cards, passports. We were now being looked after by the UK Protected Persons Service (UKPPS) and our lives would never be the same again.
