At the start of the fourth season of the popular Netflix series Stranger Things, the character Eleven has lost her telekinetic abilities. But thanks to some small business innovation, viewers can now channel her powers for a vital task: ordering a pizza. Working with ad agency WorkInProgress and content creation company UNIT9, Domino's released a new "mind-ordering" app in partnership with Netflix to promote the show's May 27 season premiere. The app allows users with a Domino's account to order a pizza simply by moving their head while looking at the screen.
