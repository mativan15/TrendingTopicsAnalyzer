Alex Hales suggested playing at Perth could limit talismanic leg-spinner Rashid Khan's influence when England face Afghanistan in their opening T20 World Cup match.

The top-ranked T20 spinner in the world is the most obvious danger to England's star-studded batting line-up on Saturday as they look to avoid a banana skin at the outset of the Super 12s stage.

Rashid leaked 110 runs in nine overs against England at the 2019 50-over World Cup, but he has a tremendous record in the Big Bash League with 92 wickets in 61 matches and a deeply impressive economy rate of 6.
