People were falling down drunk in front of Randy Miller as he walked down Lower Broadway.

He was not amused.

It was not an isolated incident, but something that happened each night he was in town as part of a fact-finding mission from Portland. What struck him even more: Seemingly no one thought it was a problem. Onlookers laughed.

Miller is a founder of Greater Portland Inc. In April, he led a group of about 100 Portland leaders on a trip to Music City to learn about community best practices, since both cities have an influx of young, educated and affluent new residents.
