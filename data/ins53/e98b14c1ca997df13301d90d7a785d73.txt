Kanye West is set to acquire Parler, the right-wing social media platform announced on Monday, following a series of anti-Semitic rants in recent days from the rapper that included vowing to go "death con 3" on "JEWISH PEOPLE" in a tweet that led to his Twitter and Instagram accounts being restricted. The purchase statement describes West, who legally changed his name to Ye, deciding to acquire Parler as "taking a bold stance against his recent censorship from Big Tech."Founded in 2018, Parler grew to prominence during the lead-up and aftermath of the 2020 presidential election.
