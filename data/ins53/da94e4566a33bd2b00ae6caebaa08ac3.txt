Buying a new television may not be top of your list of things to do on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. After all, this is the kickoff to (we hope) a few months of fun in the sun and taking in the great outdoors. But, lest we forget: 1) There'll still be plenty of rainy days when you'll want to curl up in front of a quality set and binge, game or take in a big stupid action flick; and 2) That very same counterintuitiveness about upping your TV game now only provokes manufacturers and retailers to offer extra-irresistible deals here on the last weekend of May.
