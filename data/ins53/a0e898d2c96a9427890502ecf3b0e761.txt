Business software specialist HubSpot (HUBS -4.50%) wasn't looking very special mid-week. On Wednesday, the company came under fire as two analysts reduced their price targets on its stock. By the time the smoke cleared, HubSpot's share price was down by nearly 5%, a notably steeper fall than the S&P 500 index's 0.7% slide on the day. 
So what
The two prognosticators' cuts were roughly similar. Morgan Stanley's Keith Weiss now feels HubSpot stock is worth $378 per share, down from his previous estimation of $405.
