An Irish squad of around 36 or 37 players for the November Tests against the world champions South Africa, Fiji and Australia will be named on Wednesday afternoon. And despite the season being only five weeks old Andy Farrell has been hit by a spate of injuries, most notably in the outside backs.Of the 40-man squad named for the New Zealand tour, plus three late call-ups, four players have already been ruled out. A few more have played hardly any or no rugby at all, with James Lowe among those also unlikely to feature in this squad list.
