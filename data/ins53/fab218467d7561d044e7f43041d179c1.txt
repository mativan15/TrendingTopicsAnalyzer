Published: 16:22 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 16:22 EDT, 20 October 2022 CNN released the first tailer for its new morning show on Thursday, featuring a turtle-neck-wearing Don Lemon alongside coffee-sipping Kaitlan Collins and Poppy Harlow.The ad for the show, dubbed CNN This Morning, opens with the trio sitting down for a pseudo-casual conversation around a table as they talk about when they met and started working at CNN, as well as how to best reach busy Americans with the news.Lemon, who is known for ranting about former President Trump on his primetime show, claimed in an interview with Semafor this week that he had grown 'tired' of the way his network handled politics.
