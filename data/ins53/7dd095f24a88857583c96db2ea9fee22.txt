An Abilene man suspected of robbing three convenience stores in July was indicted Thursday by a Taylor County grand jury for allegedly kidnapping and hitting an elderly woman.

Eric Miller Jr. was indicted on one count each of aggravated robbery and aggravated kidnapping in connection with the incident that occurred about three weeks before the robberies, according to court documents.

The victim June 12 reported that on the previous night, she voluntarily drove Miller to Stamford. On the return trip, he asked the victim for her cellphone to talk with people about getting money.
