This year's Epsom Derby falls on the weekend celebrating the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, and is one of the monarch's favourite events. However, the Queen herself will not be in attendance and will instead be represented by Princess Anne. There will be seven races held across Saturday afternoon, with the Queen tuning in from the comfort of Windsor Castle.The annual Epsom Derby typically sees around 100,000 spectators thanks to the accompanying Epsom Fair - making it one of the biggest sporting events in the UK.
