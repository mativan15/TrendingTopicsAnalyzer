High sticker prices of vehicles, digitalization ramp-up and strategic expansion initiatives are boosting the results of the Zacks Auto Retail and Whole Sales industry participants.

Despite macro challenges, companies like Asbury Automotive ABG, Rush Enterprises RUSHA, Group 1 Automotive GPI and Sonic Automotive SAH are well-placed to escape headwinds.
