The Cincinnati Bengals defense has been far from perfect this season and seems to be struggling more as the season continues.

But through it all, the bend-but-don't-break identity of the team has continued to show through.

That's no better example of this than the fact Cincinnati's defense is the only unit this year yet to allow a touchdown in the second half of a game. And according to ESPN's Ben Baby, the streak through six games is the first of any since 2018.

And further to the defense's credit, it has accomplished the feat with injury woes.
