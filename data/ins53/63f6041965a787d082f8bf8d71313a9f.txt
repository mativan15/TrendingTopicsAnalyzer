It is strange that the school management committee in Karnataka, headed by a local politician, could not resolve the impasse over the hijab by talking to parents. Instead, the matter went to the highest court of the land. This development points to a deeper malaise. The students' lives and their future appear caught between religion and politics. Their right to education is likely to remain confined to the pages of the Constitution and, in reality, their lives will be dictated by realpolitik. 
It is now well known that hijabs and veils are not mandatory in Islam.
