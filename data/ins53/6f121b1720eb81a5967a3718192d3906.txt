QYOU Media (OTCQB:QYOUF) has executed a binding term sheet to acquire a majority ownership stake in Maxamtech Digital Ventures, a six year old India based venture creating technology and games for the mobile gaming industry. The acquisition continues the recent push by QYOU Media and The Q India to ramp up its portfolio of direct-to-consumer products as it moves into 2023. Revenue in the mobile gaming business is expected to reach over $5B in 2025, largely fueled by discovery and adoption of casual and free to play games, a specialty of Maxamtech's Gaming 360 platform.
