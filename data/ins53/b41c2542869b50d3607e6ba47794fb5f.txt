Eden Prairie-based iMedia Brands received a notice from the Nasdaq stock market that the company is out of compliance with the minimum $1 bid price requirement.

The stock of the omnichannel retailer has traded below $1 a share since Sept. 1, and shares are currently trading around 52 cents.

IMedia's shares have ranged between $4 and $10 a share for much of the past two years but have consistently trended downward since mid March.

The company has long struggled to generate an annual profit. It has had only one profitable year in the past decade while going through several leadership and strategic changes.
