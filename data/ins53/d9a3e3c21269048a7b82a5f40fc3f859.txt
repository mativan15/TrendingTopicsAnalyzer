Six New York City real estate developers were indicted Wednesday for collecting more than $1 million in property tax benefits to promote affordable housing while renting units at sky-high prices.

Manhattan prosecutors claim Joel Kohn, Michael Ambrosino, Alen Paknoush, Mendel Gold, Ioan Sita, Gheorghe Sita, and their businesses have abused an affordable housing tax incentive program since 2011.

The developers collectively own six Brooklyn buildings.

'Not only did they illegally charge substantially higher market rents for years, but they did so while personally reaping the benefits of generous property tax abatements,' said Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.
