UFC president Dana White thinks the business of boxing has a problem, but he will not take it upon himself to find the solution.
Although White enjoys watching the sweet science as a fan, he isn't exactly jumping at the chance to promote in the sport these days, despite bouncing around some ideas of entering the space in recent years. In 2019, White aimed to start Zuffa Boxing with plans of a complete restructuring of the boxing model. However, the idea quickly fizzled and all but become an afterthought.
