Rock climbers at Skaha Bluffs Provincial Park, in Penticton, B.C, raised money for their Park Watch Program, during a two-day festival filled with games, climbing, and entertainment.
This was the first-ever Skaha Climbers Festival and it turned out to be a popular affair.'It's been an overwhelming response. We've probably had over 1,700 people in the last two days climbing here in Penticton,' said Rolf Rybak, organizer of the Skaha Climbers Festival.The Park Watch Program keeps the area safe and secure.
