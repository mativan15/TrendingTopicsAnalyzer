Reliance Industries Ltd , India's most valuable company, on Friday posted a near-flat quarterly profit as export tax on refined fuels and weak refining margins dented performance at its mainstay oil-to-chemical business.
The Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate said consolidated profit was 136.56 billion Indian rupees ($1.65 billion) in the second quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with 136.8 billion rupees a year earlier.
'Performance of our O2C business reflect subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products,' Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance, said in a statement.
