The Gujarat High Court (HC) on Friday reserved its orders on the maintainability of the petition moved by former Assistant Solicitor General (ASG) of India at the Gujarat HC IH Syed, against an FIR registered against him in Gandhinagar. 
Syed, a designated senior advocate, is seeking to quash an FIR charging him along with five others, for causing hurt, extortion, wrongful confinement and criminal intimidation, among other charges. 
The FIR registered on May 15 at the Pethapur police station in Gandhinagar, was filed on the basis of a complaint by an Ahmedabad-based businessman Viral Mukundbhai Shah (46), naming six accused, including Syed.
