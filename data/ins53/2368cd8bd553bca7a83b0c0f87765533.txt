A NEW Glasgow whisky company that likens itself to a record label for independent spirits producers has revealed details of its first move into the bottling market.

DamGoodDrams was set up by self-confessed whisky 'nerds' Paul Jamieson and Julian Mithoff at the height of lockdown in December 2020, initially as an e-commerce platform trading in casks and bottles from lesser-known distillers while the hospitality industry was closed.

Now it is preparing to debut the first whisky of its own as an independent bottler, with The Spirit of Glaschu (Gaelic for Glasgow) expected to be launched later this month.
