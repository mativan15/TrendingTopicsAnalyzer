Published: 09:10 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 09:10 EDT, 20 October 2022 Manchester United legend Ruud van Nistelrooy has joked that he expects a 'warm welcome' when he takes his place in the PSV dugout at the Emirates Stadium on Thursday.The Dutch forward - now in charge of the Eredivisie outfit - won a Premier League and FA Cup with United, but a missed penalty at Old Trafford against Arsenal in 2003-04 was perhaps his most infamous exploit on English soil. And Martin Keown, who perhaps overzealously celebrated the missed penalty, has since claimed he could not trust Van Nistelrooy for a fair fight, branding him a 'figure of hate'.
