 Sylvester Stallone and his wife Jennifer Flavin are keeping the dog they reportedly fell out over. The actor, 76, and Jennifer, 54, split earlier this year, with his wife of 25 years announcing in August she had filed for divorce. It was speculated at the time that part of the reason for their separation was Sylvester's new dog, rottweiler Dwight, though Sly denied this.
