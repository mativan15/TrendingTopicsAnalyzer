 Manitoba has launched a new website to support food and agri-product entrepreneurs, businesses and organizations, Agriculture Minister Derek Johnson announced on Tuesday.
'Whether you have a new food product idea, you see an unmet demand for local food, or you want to grow a food business, the Business Pathways website can help you build your future in food,' said Johnson.
