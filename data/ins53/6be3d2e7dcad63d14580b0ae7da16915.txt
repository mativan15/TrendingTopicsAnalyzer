Workers on strike gather in front of the French oil giant TotalEnergies refinery in Donges near Saint-Nazaire, France October 12, 2022. 
The time for talking is over, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Monday, as the government ordered more fuel depot staff back to work to try to restore petrol supplies that have been disrupted by strikes for weeks.The government said it had requisitioned six workers at a TotalEnergies depot in Dunkirk, northern France, and would do the same at its Feyzin depot in the southeast this afternoon.
