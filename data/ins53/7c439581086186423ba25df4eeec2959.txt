Researchers from North Carolina State University and Texas Tech University have developed a straightforward questionnaire that older adults can use to assess their "attentional performance" during driving. In proof-of-concept testing, the researchers have demonstrated the tool can predict which drivers are at increased risk of having accidents.
"We developed the tool, called the Attentional Failure during Driving Questionnaire (AFDQ), so that older drivers can recognize and monitor their ability to drive safely," says Jing Feng, co-author of the study and an associate professor of psychology at NC State.
