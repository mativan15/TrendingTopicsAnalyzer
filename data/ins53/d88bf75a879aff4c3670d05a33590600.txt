Liz Truss has been told to reconsider her Government's approach to corporation tax in order to resolve the 'incoherence of the current trajectory'. The Prime Minister yesterday confirmed that she is U-turning on her plan to scrap an increase in the tax on business profits, admitting her Government's recent ‘mini-budget' went 'faster and further' than many expected.The rate was set to remain at 19 percent after Ms Truss promised to cancel former Chancellor Rishi Sunak's plans to put it up.In a statement which followed the sacking of Kwasi Kwarteng from the Cabinet, the PM said raising the figure to 25 percent would help to 'reassure the markets of our fiscal discipline'.
