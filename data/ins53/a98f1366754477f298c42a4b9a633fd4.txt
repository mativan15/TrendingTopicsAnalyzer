LONDON — Prime Minister Liz Truss was set to face Parliament on Wednesday, the first big test of her embattled premiership since she ditched almost all of her economic policies and changed finance ministers.Her appearance at prime minister's questions, or PMQs — only her third since becoming prime minister — came as a report said the cost of living in Britain increased 10.1 percent in September compared with prices last year.Truss has endured brutal polls in recent days. One poll from YouGov found that only 10 percent of voters have a favorable view of her making her the most unpopular prime minister the organization has ever tracked.
