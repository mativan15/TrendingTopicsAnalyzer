AgenciesAccording to the local media, the Japanese government passed a proposal on October 14 to amend six laws associated with the Foreign Exchange Act to stop cryptocurrency money laundering. The cryptocurrency exchange companies will now need to confirm information such as user names and notify the business owners, according to the new laws. The measure suggests raising the penalty for money laundering offences as part of its relatively strict approach to crimes fueled by cryptocurrencies.

The Japanese government also has the authority to freeze the assets of groups and people named by the UN if they are discovered to be complicit in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
