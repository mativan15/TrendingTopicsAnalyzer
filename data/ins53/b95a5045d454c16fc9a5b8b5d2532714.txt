Who will win the Iron Throne this time around?
'Game of Thrones,' one of the biggest television hits in history, has had a wildly successful spin-off, filled with all the goodies we've come to expect from the HBO franchise: sex, scandals, backstabbing and, of course, dragons. The new series, which brought in record numbers every single week, is set to have four seasons with 10-episode orders. 
Another 'Game of Thrones' spin-off is in the works, too, currently titled: 'SNOW' and will be an official sequel to the original acclaimed series.
