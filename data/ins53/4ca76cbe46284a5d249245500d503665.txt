The head of a big four bank has reacted with surprise about new Opposition Leader Peter Dutton's declaration of estrangement from big business, saying it didn't square with his recent experience of the Coalition government.

In his first official press conference as Liberal leader, Dutton on Monday said the party had become estranged from big business as he pitched his political allegiance to smaller, suburban operators in Australia's economic landscape.

'All I want to do is to make sure that we don't forget about those in the suburbs, and I do think they are the forgotten people,' Dutton said yesterday.
