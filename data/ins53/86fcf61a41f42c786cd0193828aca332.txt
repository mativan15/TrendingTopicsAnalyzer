A New Zealand brewery is making batches of its finest craft beer using less landfill waste per week than an average household. Founded in 2004, the Sawmill Brewery has beers ranging from tropical sour, to American pale ales to hazy IPAs. In 2019, it became a B-Corp after going through the checks and processes to ensure that the business was operating in an environmentally friendly manner. B Corps are businesses verified by B Lab to achieve high standards of social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability.
