Cloudflare is poised for a big comeback going forward, according to Wells Fargo. Analyst Andrew Nowinski upgraded the stock to overweight from equal weight, raising his price target to $65 from $62. The new target implies upside of 42% from Friday's close. He said the stock, which is down 65% this year, is at an attractive entry point as it gains market share and sees investments pay off while lowering costs through consolidation. He also said that a sign of the company's future health could come during its earnings call early next month.
