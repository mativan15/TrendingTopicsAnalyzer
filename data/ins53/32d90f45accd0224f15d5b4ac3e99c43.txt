Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is being analyzed up and down Wall Street after the electric vehicle market reiterated its multi-year 50% annual delivery growth target, but warned logistical and supply chain issues could keep it from hitting that pace this year. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas called it a clean quarter for TSLA with an EPS beat despite lower regulatory credits, rising input costs, FX headwinds, logistics/plant ramp-up inefficiencies. He noted that $3.3B of free cash flow was nearly 3X the firm's forecast.
