Michael M. Santiago Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), the last of the "too-big-to-fail" U.S. banks to announce Q3 earnings on Tuesday, will likely be increasing its provision for credit losses to prepare for a slowing economy, as has its peers. Investment banking activity has been slow in 2022. Higher interest rates and volatile markets have put a damper on equity and debt issuances, and M&A activity has dropped as well. That's likely to weigh on the company's earnings. Goldman (GS) is expected to post Q3 GAAP EPS of $7.
