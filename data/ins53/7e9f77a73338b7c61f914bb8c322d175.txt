As part of October 19's Silent Hill Transmission, a new entry in the Silent Hill series has been revealed. Silent Hill: Townfall is a collaboration between Konami, Annapurna Interactive, and the BAFTA award-winning No Code studio. While the conference featured a short teaser trailer, not much has been revealed about the upcoming game. However, No Code creative director Jon McKellan stated the game respects the Silent Hill franchise, while doing "something a little bit different" with the series' source material.
