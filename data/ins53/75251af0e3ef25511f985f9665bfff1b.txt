Alabama was coming off a road loss on an end-of-game field goal entering the last Mississippi State game, too.

It didn't go well for the Bulldogs.

The sixth-ranked Crimson Tide (6-1, 3-1 Southeastern Conference) hosts No. 24 Mississippi State (5-2, 3-2) Saturday night trying to bounce back from a 52-49 loss to Tennessee. Alabama rebounded from a loss to Texas A&M last season with a 49-9 win in Starkville.

'After the game on Saturday, I heard a lot of guys say, ‘We know this feeling, we know how to bounce back,'' Tide linebacker Will Anderson Jr.
