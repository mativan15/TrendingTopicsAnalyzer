The Albanese Labor government's decision to reverse its predecessor's recognition of West Jerusalem as Israel's capital has elicited a predictable reaction from Israel and its supporters in Australia.

Israel's Prime Minister Yair Lapid condemned what he described as a 'hasty response' to indications in the Australian media Canberra was about to shift ground on recognition of West Jerusalem.

Guardian Australia had noted a change on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website.

In Australia, Colin Rubenstein, spokesman for the Australia Israel Jewish Affairs Council (AIJAC), called the reversal a 'pointless own goal'.
