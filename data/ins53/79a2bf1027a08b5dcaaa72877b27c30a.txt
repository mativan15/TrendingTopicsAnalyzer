SoftBank and Goldman Sachs have invested in Rimac in a €500mn funding round that gives the Croatian electric supercar maker and technology group a valuation of more than €2bn, according to the company.It will use the new investments in part to build its fledgling self-driving robotaxi business, which has been under secret development for the past three years, founder Mate Rimac told the Financial Times.The new venture is still 'in stealth mode' but hopes to be operational in 2024 and will eventually become 'bigger than everything we have done so far', he said.
