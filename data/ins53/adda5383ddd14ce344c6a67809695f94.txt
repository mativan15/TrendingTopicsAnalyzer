The state pension triple lock is a rule that means the state pension must rise each year in line with the highest of three possible figures, inflation, average earnings or 2.5 percent. The triple lock was a rule brought in by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2010 and has been promised in each Tory manifesto since then. The Government uses it to make sure that people's retirement benefits keep pace with the rising cost of living.However, the triple lock was temporarily paused for the 2022-23 financial year.
