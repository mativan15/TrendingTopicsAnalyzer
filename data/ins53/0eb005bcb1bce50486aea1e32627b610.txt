'I'm not business as usual,' Kohi Māori constituency councillor Toi Iti told his fellow new councillors as he spoke to his nomination to be deputy chairman of the Bay of Plenty Regional Council. The newly elected council held its inaugural meeting at Te Manuka Tutahi Marae in Whakatāne on Wednesday (October 19). After a powhiri led by Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Awa chairman Joe Harawira and the swearing in of councillors, Doug Leeder was returned to his former position as chairman, winning 10 votes to four over Ōkurei Māori councillor Te Taru White.
