The lead singer of the K-pop boy band BTS has been ordered to compulsory military duty in South Korea, inviting comparisons to Elvis Presley's enlistment in the U.S. Army in 1957.

Kim Seok-jin, known professionally as Jin, will soon begin military service and the other members of BTS will eventually follow suit, according to a statement from Big Hit Music, the group's agency.

The draft notice for Jin, who turns 30 this year, comes amid ongoing discussions within South Korea's National Assembly about revising the Military Service Act that would have exempted the seven members of BTS from mandatory military service in recognition of their contributions to the country's culture and entertainment industry, according to The Korea Times.
