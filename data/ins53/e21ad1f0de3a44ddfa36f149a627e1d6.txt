The recently unveiled U.S. Uniting for Ukraine program is now in full swing. The program provides a pathway for Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members who are outside the United States to come to the U.S. and stay temporarily for a two-year period of parole. Ukrainians overseas must have a sponsor in the United States who agrees to provide them with financial support for the duration of their stay in the United States.
