The Delhi High Court has said that mere smuggling of gold without any connection to a threat to the economic security or monetary stability of the country is not a "terrorist act" under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. A bench headed by Justice Mukta Gupta, while granting bail to nine persons arrested for allegedly smuggling over 500 gold bars weighing 83.621 kg from Assam to Delhi, said that even after an amendment to the definition of "terrorist act" under the UAPA, 'gold' was not added to Section 15(1)(a)(iiia) which defines the act in the context of a damage to the monetary stability of India by smuggling, etc.
