Variety - Film News Attorneys for Kevin Spacey rested their case on Wednesday, while attempting to paint Anthony Rapp as a narcissist who is bringing a 40 million sexual misconduct lawsuit against the Oscar-winning actor in order to draw attention to himself. Rapp only wanted to attend a 'highly publicized hearing with media attention,' Spacey's attorney Chase Scolnick asserted at one point.To push that line of attack, Scolnick grilled forensic psychiatrist Alexander Bardey about Rapp's emotional state.
