Last week, you might have seen that YouGov plc (LON:YOU) released its annual result to the market. The early response was not positive, with shares down 5.1% to UK£7.84 in the past week. Sales of UK£221m surpassed estimates by 2.6%, although statutory earnings per share missed badly, coming in 26% below expectations at UK£0.15 per share. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company.
