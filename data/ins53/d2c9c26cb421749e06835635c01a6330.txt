Residents of Long Island have been keenly looking forward to the weekend for a very special event. After a gap of four years, the U.S. Navy Blue Angels will be arriving at Jones Beach and delivering a performance at the Bethpage Airshow. A large number of people based in and around are expected to gather at Jones Beach to watch this special performance. However, there are times when you make some plans but external factors make you postpone or cancel them altogether. Owing to unfavorable weather conditions, the officials decided to do away with the rehearsals that were planned for the big weekend performance.
