Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., tweeted then deleted a report that he has been dipping into taxpayer money in order to bankroll personal flights between Washington, D.C. and his Florida vacation home, which he visited nine times over the last year.
According to The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation, federal records indicate that the Wisconsin Republican has gone on taxpayer-funded jaunts from Washington to Fort Myers, Florida at least 19 times between 2013 and 2021. Each of Johnson's flights apparently cost anywhere from $227 to $1,152.
