Nth Moto, the Minnesota shop responsible for some truly gigantic-number Viper builds, is at it again. Its newest job, a Viper ACR, might be its most ridiculous yet. Though this ACR looks stock, it's packing one of Nth Moto's own billet aluminum 9.0-liter V-10 engine blocks paired to a couple of turbos and a sequential transmission. It's ridiculously powerful and sounds wonderful.

The company recently published a dyno video showing off its latest build 0n a customer's ACR.
