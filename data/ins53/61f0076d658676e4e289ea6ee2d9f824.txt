The owner of a Timaru nursery which has been struck by thieves three times this month has been left out-of-pocket and upset. 'It's really discouraging,' Greenleaf Plant Centre's co-owner Marina Omelvena said. Omelvena said the thefts followed a particularly difficult few years in business. 'Mentally, it's quite difficult. It's been a hard couple of years. During the hail three years ago, we lost 80% of our stock and then a few months later Covid hit and there was another lock down.'
