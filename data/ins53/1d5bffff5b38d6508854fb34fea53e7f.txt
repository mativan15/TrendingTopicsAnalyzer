MEXICO CITY, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Mexico's craft beer industry should grow by over 10% this year, the country's brewing association ACERMEX said on Friday, even as it faces sky-rocketing costs and competition from European-owned heavyweights.

"The effects of the pandemic, added to the war between Russia and Ukraine ... have caused costs to skyrocket," ACERMEX official Jose Rosas told Reuters.

"Most of the supplies for independent beer producers are imported, so the rising exchange rate is a problem and also the supplies are expensive due to shortages.
