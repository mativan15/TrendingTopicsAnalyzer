Published: 06:24 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 06:24 EDT, 21 October 2022 Newcastle boss Eddie Howe has defended the club's decision to head back to Saudi Arabia for a controversial warm-weather training camp during the forthcoming break for the World Cup. The Magpies, who travelled to Jeddah in January for similar reasons, will return to the Gulf state between December 4 and 10 and face Pro League champions Al-Hilal in a friendly. Confirmation of the trip will re-ignite criticism over the club's links to the Middle East nation and its human rights record – Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund holds and 80 cent stake in the consortium which bought out Mike Ashley in October last year.
