Published: 01:54 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 01:54 EDT, 18 October 2022 A week into the season, both the Columbus Blue Jackets and Vancouver Canucks are still searching for their first victory. Each aims to avoid opening with four straight losses when the teams meet on Tuesday night at Columbus. The Blue Jackets most recently dropped their first four games of the season in 2015-16, when they began 0-8-0. Meanwhile, the Canucks last failed to record a win in their initial four contests during the shortened 1995 season, when they tied the opener, then lost three straight.
