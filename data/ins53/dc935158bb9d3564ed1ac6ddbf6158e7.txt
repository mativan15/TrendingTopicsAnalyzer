Ukrainian forces desperately tried to block a complete Russian takeover of one of the country's two eastern provinces Tuesday, with Russian troops clawing out incremental gains even as European leaders agreed to a partial oil embargo aimed at starving Moscow's mammoth war machine.

A combined force of Russian troops, Chechen fighters and pro-Moscow separatists slugged their way deeper into Severodonetsk, the Ukrainian government's seat of power in the province of Luhansk, seizing a sizable portion of a city that has been almost completely destroyed in the fighting.
