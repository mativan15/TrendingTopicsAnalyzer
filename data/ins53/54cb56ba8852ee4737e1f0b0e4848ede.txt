After a Scheduled Caste (SC) student filed a writ appeal in the Madras High Court appealing his result in the NEET - conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) - the court directed authorities to award him four grace marks. T Udhayakumar had abstained from answering one question - whose options didn't have the right answer - on the exam, fearing negative marking. When the results came in, Udhayakumar secured 92 out of a possible 720, one mark short of the cut-off for SC candidates. He filed representation online but was unsuccessful; he later filed a writ petition which was withdrawn by his counsel, following which the current appeal was filed.
