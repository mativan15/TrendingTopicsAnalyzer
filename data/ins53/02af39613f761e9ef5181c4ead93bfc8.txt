A former Deal or No Deal briefcase girl has rejected claims made by the Duchess of Sussex that the show reduced them to 'bimbos'.
Claudia Jordan, who appeared alongside the Duchess in 2006 and 2007, defended the show after Meghan claimed she was valued for her "beauty", not "brains", on her Archetypes podcast.
Posting on Instagram, Ms Jordan said: "For clarity - yes getting a modeling gig on a game show isn't necessarily about your intellect, but every show the executive producers picked five models with the most outgoing and fun personalities to place mics on, who they knew would engage with the contestants.
