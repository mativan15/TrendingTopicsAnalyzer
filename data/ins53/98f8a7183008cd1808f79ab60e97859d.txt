The Nova Scotia Nature Trust has secured more than 85 per cent of the hidden offshore gems it's protecting in its 100 Wild Islands campaign. But a hidden gem along the province's eastern shore remains unprotected and time is running out. Little Charles is currently owned by developers and will hit the market next month. The Nature Trust hopes to raise enough money to purchase it. 'To have a development and privatization and everybody has to keep off this island would be heartbreaking for Nova Scotians,'said Bonnie Sutherland, Nova Scotia Nature Trust executive director.
