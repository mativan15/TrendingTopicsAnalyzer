Snowflake 's shares have plummeted 59.2% this year as rising rates threaten popular growth stocks, but Raymond James is "seeing through the whiteout." Analyst Simon Leopold initiated coverage of Snowflake with an outperform rating, saying in a note to clients Thursday that the company is a "share gainer" and a "pure play" in the growing cloud market. "We think Snowflake's quality/market position will enable it to outperform as growth proves durable and margins move substantially higher," Leopold wrote.
