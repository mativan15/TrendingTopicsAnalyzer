Oct 21 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index rose on Friday, buoyed by stronger energy shares and miners, although concerns around rising interest rates to combat high inflation kept gains in check.

At 10:21 a.m. ET (14:21 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was up 124.64 points, or 0.67%, at 18,703.93, coming off session lows and setting up the index for a weekly gain.
