Rail passengers are being warned of significant disruption to services over the Bank Holiday weekend because of a strike by conductors at a train company.

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) at TransPennine Express walked out on Saturday and will strike again on Sunday in a long-running dispute over pay.

TransPennine Express (TPE) urged people not to travel, saying it will be running an amended timetable on both days, with a very limited service available for those making essential journeys.
