European stocks closed in green on Thursday after Liz Truss gave up the keys to No10, resigning as prime minister after weeks of market and political turmoil.

Truss confirmed she'll be stepping down from the top job after just 44 days, announcing that she will stay on as PM and that there will be a leadership election to replace her, which will "be delivered within the next week".

Speaking from a lectern in Downing Street, Truss said she told the King she was quitting as the leader of the Conservatives as she can no longer deliver the mandate which Tory members gave her just over six weeks ago.
