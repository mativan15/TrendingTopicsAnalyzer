Welcome to IGN Unfiltered, our semi-regularly occurring interview series where we sit down with the best, brightest, and most fascinating minds in the video game industry. (Catch up on the other 60+ episodes here.) My guest this episode is Justin Roiland, the co-creator of Rick & Morty (as well as the voice of both), the co-creator of Solar Opposites (as well as the voice of Korvo), and the founder of Squanch Games, the independent video game development studio currently finishing up High on Life.
