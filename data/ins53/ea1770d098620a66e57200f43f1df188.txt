Nothing Phone (1) becomes the first smartphone in India to support Jio's Standalone 5G network.
 Nothing Phone (1) has garnered a lot of attention over the last few months for its unique design and the standout Glyph LED lights. It also got some backlash after its Android 13 update schedule was announced. It also got a mega price cut during the Flipkart and Amazon sale over the past few weeks. Now, the Phone (1) achieves a record in the Indian market. With its latest software update, Nothing has now added support for Jio's 5G SA network.
