 A psychiatrist has testified that a psychotic episode that led to an Alberta man killing his mother earlier this year may have been triggered by his attending a religious gathering in Atlanta.
Dr. Kenneth Hashman initially found Alexander James Thorpe, who is 21, fit to stand trial in the death of Melanie Lowen, whose body was found at her home in Airdrie, north of Calgary, in January.
