Lights, camera, action! London International Airport will be in the spotlight over the weekend as a new movie is being filmed on location. Filming for the movie — the name of which has not been released — began Friday and will wrap up Saturday. The airport was temporarily closed during filming Saturday, but is scheduled to reopen to the public around 2 p.m.  Manager of Commercial Services and Passenger Experience Gerry Vanderhoek told CTV News that with the loss of business during the COVID-19 pandemic, it's a positive to finally have additional revenue funneled to the airport during filming.
