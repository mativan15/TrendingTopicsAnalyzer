The recent announcement of $32 million in extra funding the federal government is giving the province to improve care for seniors in long-tern care facilities should not be used to "backfill" previous pandemic spending, says Opposition NDP seniors critic Matt Love.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the announcement last week in Saskatoon along with Everett Hindley, Saskatchewan's minister of mental health and addictions, seniors and rural and remote health.Trudeau said the money, taken from the federal Safe Long-Term Care Fund, was earmarked for improving care, safer dining practices, increased site cleaning and staff safety protocols.
