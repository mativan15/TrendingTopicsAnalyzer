Collider.com As 2022 inches closer to its end, we can't help but start looking to the early cinema releases of 2023 to know what's coming our way along with the new year. One of the most anticipated titles from the first trimester is Creed III, which got its first adrenaline-fueled trailer today. The story will once more center around Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) making his way in the boxing rings and carrying on the legacy of Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) and Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers).
