'I'm not Warren Buffett.'

So declared Tesla CEO Elon Musk during the EV company's third-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. 'I'm not an investor,' he said. "I am an engineer and manufacturing person and a technologist.'

Musk was responding to an analyst's question about whether he would incorporate all his ventures—from SpaceX to (soon) Twitter—under a parent corporation. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has built a large investment portfolio that owns everything from Dairy Queen and Duracell to GEICO and Fruit of the Loom.
