BMW revealed the 2023 X1 to us the other day, but what it didn't unveil for Americans is the fully-electric BMW iX1. That's because the iX1 isn't currently slated to be sold here, but nevertheless, we have pictures and details for the curious.

Appearance-wise, you'll notice that the iX1 looks very similar to the regular X1. Obvious differences include the bright blue accents everywhere, the big 'iX1' lettering on the rear … and that's it. BMW made the electric version mirror the gas-powered X1 very closely, so it's a rather normal-looking EV.
