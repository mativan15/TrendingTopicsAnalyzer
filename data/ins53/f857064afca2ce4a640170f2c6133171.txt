Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.

Bangkok-headquartered Siam Commercial Bank (SBC), the oldest and one of the biggest banks in Thailand, has entered the decentralized finance (DeFi) realm via Compound Treasury, the lending platform's institution-focused service.

The digital venture arm of the bank, a subsidiary called SCB 10X that was launched at the beginning of 2020, will deposit funds into Compound Treasury, a kind of institutional wrapper that leverages custody firm Fireblocks, the companies said.
