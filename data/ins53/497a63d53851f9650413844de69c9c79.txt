Jun. 2—ROCHESTER — The van ride from Pine Island to Rochester was a quiet one on Wednesday morning.

The defending Section 1AA boys golf championship team from Pine Island/Zumbrota-Mazeppa was in a tight battle with rival Stewartville after the first round of the section meet at Northern Hills Golf Course.

Stewartville shot a first-round 324 on Tuesday, while PIZM came in at 326. The deficit was far from insurmountable, but it was a deficit nonetheless.

"One-hundred percent, we just threw all expectations out the window," PIZM senior Anders Larson said.
