Mitchell Starc suggested docking batters runs, to end the habit of non-strikers backing up too far without compelling bowlers to 'create potentially ugly scenes by running them out' according to an interview to The Age and Sydney Morning Herald.
Starc had earlier warned England's captain Jos Buttler for backing up too far in a Twenty20 game in Canberra, and said that warning batters had been an almost constant theme of his career. Starc told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald his solution was 'to use the fixed cameras monitoring no-balls to also check if a batter is leaving the crease before the bowler's front foot lands.
