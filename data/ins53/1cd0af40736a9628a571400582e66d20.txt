Capital markets regulator Sebi on Friday came out with a new framework for investor grievance redressal mechanism as part of its effort to strengthen the process. The new mechanism will come into effect from July 1, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a circular. For any dispute between the member and client relating to the transactions in a stock exchange, which is of civil nature, the complainant or member is required to first refer the complaint to the investor grievance redressal mechanism (IGRC) and/or to the arbitration mechanism provided by the bourse before resorting to other remedies available under any other law, Sebi said.
