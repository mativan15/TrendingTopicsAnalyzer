(Bloomberg) -- Supplies of fuel in France eased slightly on Saturday, including in the Paris region, even as the hard-left CGT union extended a walkout into next week at TotalEnergies SE refineries.A crowd-sourced website that shows fuel availability indicated increasing numbers of filling stations in Paris with at least some products in stock. The latest official data, released on Friday, showed that 37%% of gas stations in the Paris region were short of at least one fuel, higher than the nationwide figure of 28.
