Sadio Mane appears to be closing in on a move to Bayern Munich, and Liverpool have been advised over who they should prioritise in this summer's transfer window. They've been told they need to make three signings to cope with the loss of Mane, and also to be at full strength next season.After teasing that he would announce his future after the Champions League final, it was reported on Sunday that Mane was ready for a new experience away from Liverpool this summer.Bayern have expressed major interest in Mane, but Liverpool will not let him go cheaply as they have given the Bundesliga side 'three reasons' for their £40million-plus price tag.
