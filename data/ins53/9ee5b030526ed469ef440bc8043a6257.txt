His dunks were a treat and his ‘rim-hanging' antics brought loud cheers from the crowd. International Sejin Mathew came up with a sterling show as Kochi Tigers kept their cool under pressure and pulled off a stunning 78-73 victory over favourite Chennai Heat in the Indian National Basketball League at the Rajiv Gandhi indoor stadium here on Monday night.
It was Kochi's second straight win in the six-team league and for Chennai, its first loss in two matches.
The Kochi boys bottled up Chennai star Baladhaneshwar for a good part of the match with point guard Lalrina Renthlei doing an effective dance in front of him.
