LOS ANGELES (CNS) - The city of Los Angeles has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 36% from its 1990 baseline, Mayor Eric Garcetti said Tuesday while announcing an update of his "Green New Deal." The program was launched in 2019, setting ambitious new environmental goals in a range of areas including electric vehicles, air quality, trees and public transportation. "When we laid out LA's Green New Deal, we presented a vision for the sustainable and equitable future our children deserve -- and three years later, we can proudly report on our incredible progress," Garcetti said.
