Rail operator SNCF will see 'severe disruptions' with half of train services cancelled, Transport Minister Clement Beaune said
France was preparing for a day of major disruptions on Tuesday after unions called a nationwide transport strike as they remain in deadlock with the government over walkouts at oil depots that have sparked fuel shortages.The move comes after workers at several refineries and depots operated by energy giant TotalEnergies voted to extend their strike action.Their industrial action has seriously disrupted fuel distribution across the country but particularly in northern and central France and the Paris region.
