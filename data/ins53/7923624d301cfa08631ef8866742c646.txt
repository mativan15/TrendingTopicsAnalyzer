More than 50 Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs) are waiting to enter GIFT City this financial year, said Injeti Srinivas, chairman of International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) at GIFT City.
This is in addition to AIFs who have been given permission to operate from the campus in Gandhinagar.
'One way to attract capital is to bring in foreign banks. Currently eight of them have come to GIFT. These will bring capital from overseas. The second way is through insurance and reinsurance business.
