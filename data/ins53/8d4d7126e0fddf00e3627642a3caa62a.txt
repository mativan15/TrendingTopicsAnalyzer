Oct. 21—RALEIGH — The most recent jobless report from the North Carolina Department of Commerce provides a glimpse of condtions in Robeson County.

A county level report won't be released until the first week in November, but statewide, manfacturing jobs declined slightly from August to September.

Considerding that the manufacturing industry in Robeson County accounts for just under half (43.78%) of all jobs in the county, the Commerce Department's report could indicate a slight drop in manufaturing jobs in the county.
