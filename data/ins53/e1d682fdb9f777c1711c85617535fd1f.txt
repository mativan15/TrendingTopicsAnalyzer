The lives of thousands of Onslow County residents have now been saved with the seizure of about five pounds of fentanyl.

The Onslow County Sheriff's Office responded to a call for a domestic-related incident at Eider Loop Road in Jacksonville on Sept. 20, according to a recent news release. Upon executing a search warrant, investigators located 2.5 kilos of fentanyl, over 40 pounds of marijuana, two rifles, three handguns and about $10,000.

OCSO Chief Deputy Colonel Chris Thomas said in an email that the amount of fentanyl seized could have easily killed thousands of Onslow County residents, though it's hard to estimate as it depends on the dosage an individual would use and how it is cut.
