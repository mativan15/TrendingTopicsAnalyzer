Helmet toss is the new mic drop
Forget the mic-drop moment, Shubman Gill has come up with a new emphatic gesture to signal the conclusion of a stunning performance. Minutes after he had sealed the final with a six and let-out a Tarzan-like victory cry, he was mobbed by his ecstatic team-mates. Almost crushed by the euphoria around him, he took off his helmet and tossed it away. It was a statement that the game was over, the match mask needed to be ripped off and it was time for celebrations. In the company of his mates, in the warm embrace of the support staff, Gill didn't need protection.
