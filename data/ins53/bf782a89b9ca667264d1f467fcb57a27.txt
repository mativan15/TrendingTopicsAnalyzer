British academics have continued working with US-sanctioned Chinese companies despite their universities claiming that formal research collaborations with them had ceased.An audit by The Times and Civitas found that academics at universities that had highlighted ending work with military-linked Chinese organisations after being criticised had continued to co-author academic papers with them.Concerns have been raised that collaborations with civilian research that can have military applications risks British research supporting the authoritarian state in expanding its military reach.
