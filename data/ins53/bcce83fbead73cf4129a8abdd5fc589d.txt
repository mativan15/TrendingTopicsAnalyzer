By Sarah Fortinsky and Chandelis Duster, CNNCNN — Former President Donald Trump endorsed House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy for another term in Congress on Saturday, calling him "an outstanding Representative for the people of California, and a strong and fearless Leader of the House Republican Conference."
The endorsement comes nearly two months after the release of tapes featuring McCarthy privately bashing Trump in the immediate aftermath of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. The two have maintained a good relationship since that controversy first broke.
