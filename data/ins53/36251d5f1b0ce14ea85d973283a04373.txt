The Kansas City Chiefs have filled the latest vacancy on their practice squad.
After losing DE Benton Whitley to the Minnesota Vikings earlier this week, the Chiefs have added one of their former receivers to the practice squad. Kansas City signed Ihmir Smith-Marsette, who was waived by the Chicago Bears just a few days ago, to the practice squad as first reported by Chiefs Digest's Matt Derrick.

A fifth-round draft pick by the Vikings in 2021, Smith-Marsette appeared in eight games with the Vikings last season.
