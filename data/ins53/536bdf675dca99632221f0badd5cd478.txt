In the aftermath of the release of 11 men convicted of gangraping a pregnant Bilkis Bano and murdering 14 members of her family, including her 3-year-old daughter Saleha on March 3, 2002, in the post-Godhra violence in Dahod district of Gujarat, there was rightful outrage. How could these convicts — they were not merely accused, innocent until proven guilty, or undertrials who deserved the benefit of doubt — be allowed to walk free? How could perpetrators of a crime as dark as this one benefit from the legal provision for remission of sentence, after 14 years, for 'good' conduct in jail? True, due process is an inalienable part of justice.
