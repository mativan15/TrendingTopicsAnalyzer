TRAVELLERS due to fly out of UK airports are being warned to check their travel insurance policies to make sure they're covered as chaos continues to plague getaways.
Any airline cancelling your flight within two weeks is legally obliged to give you compensation as well as either a refund or alternative flight as well as food, drink and even accommodation if you're delayed overnight.

Even lengthy delays mean compensation - if you're delayed more than three hours on or short and mid haul flights and four hours on long haul flights.
