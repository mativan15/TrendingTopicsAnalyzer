ONE Championship dual-champion Reinier de Ridder likes his chances against UFC middleweight champ Israel Adesanya.
De Ridder (15-0), ONE's middleweight and light heavyweight title holder, is unbeaten in his professional MMA career and is coming off a third-round submission of Kiamrian Abbasov this past February.
Training with Bellator middleweight champ Gegard Mousasi has given de Ridder a good gauge of where he stands among the elite, and he has no doubt that he'd be able to impose his grappling prowess on Adesanya (22-1 MMA, 11-1 UFC) if they fought.
