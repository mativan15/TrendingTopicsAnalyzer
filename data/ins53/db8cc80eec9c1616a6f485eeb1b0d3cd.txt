Cryptocurrencies were higher on Monday after recovering from a sharp drop in the previous week.

Bitcoin rose 1% to $19,457.00, according to Coin Metrics, while ether traded 1.5% higher at $1,317.01.

Prices have held steady since rebounding from a big drop that followed the release of the latest reading on the consumer price index, a key inflation gauge. Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank, said the dip wasn't deep enough to induce panic, however.

"It had been another tough week for the stock market until the CPI, so Thursday's rebound will likely trigger unwinding of the recent risk off sentiment, which could have a positive effect on the price of bitcoin," he said.
