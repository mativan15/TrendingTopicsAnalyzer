OTTAWA - When Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne gets in front a microphone to talk about electrifying Canada's auto industry, he has a favourite line to sum up his efforts to attract global investment: 'Not everyone in the world wakes up thinking about Canada.'

His job, as he sees it, is to change that.

'I never stop,' the 52-year-old former lawyer and business development strategist said in an interview. 'You know me. I'm pretty persistent.'

Champagne is a ball of energy, earning him the affectionate nickname 'Franky Bubbles' among some Ottawa types.
