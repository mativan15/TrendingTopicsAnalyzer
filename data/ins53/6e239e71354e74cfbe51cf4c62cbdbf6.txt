Every election is believed to be dramatic. It is an opportunity for politicians and the public to make history and to change the trajectory of a nation.

For the last three and a half years, Israel has lurched from one election to another, with the most significant result being the establishment of a government last year that was not led by Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time in more than 12 years.

While it is always risky to predict, I believe that the upcoming election on November 1 is one of the most important in Israel's 75 years and, more specifically, potentially the most dangerous.
