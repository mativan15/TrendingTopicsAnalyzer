One important part of the recession playbook is "obsolete" — and that's seeking shelter in bonds, according to BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. "Recession fears are roiling markets. Investors traditionally take cover in sovereign bonds, but we see this recession playbook as obsolete," strategists from BlackRock Investment Institute, led by Jean Boivin, wrote in a note earlier this week. Central banks have been hiking interest rates to control inflation, "causing recessions" in the process.
