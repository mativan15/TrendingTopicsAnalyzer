Chadian security forces opened fire on anti-government demonstrators in the country's two largest cities and killed at least 60 people. Hundreds protested against interim leader Mahamat Idriss Deby's two-year extension of power. The government said 30 people were dead in the capital, N'Djamena, while organizers of the march placed the toll higher, at 40.
