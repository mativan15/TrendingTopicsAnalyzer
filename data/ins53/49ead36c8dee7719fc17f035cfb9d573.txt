SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Kody Huff and Drew Bowser each hit two of Stanford's five home runs and the top-seeded Cardinal never trailed Thursday night in their 15-8 win over Arizona in the Pac-12 Tournament. Ranked No. 3 nationally in the D1Baseball poll, Stanford (39-14) scored in five straight innings — capped by a five-run top of the sixth — to take a 13-4 lead. The Cardinal, who extended the program's longest win streak since 1999 to 13 games, plays in Saturday's semifinals against the winner of Friday's loser-out game between Arizona and Arizona State.
