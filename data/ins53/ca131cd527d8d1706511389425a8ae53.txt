Maryland was selected as an NCAA baseball tournament regional site Sunday for the first time in program history.  College Park will be one of the 16 regional hosts, with the games starting Friday, June 3, at Bob 'Turtle' Smith Stadium. The Terrapins (45-12) will find out their seed along with the other three teams that will play in the College Park Regional as the full 64-team field is unveiled Monday at noon during the NCAA Baseball Selection Show on ESPN2. Hosting a regional site comes on the heels of the Terrapins' best regular season in school history.
