Nick Kyrgios insists controversial personalities like Alexander Bublik are ‘definitely needed' in tennis amid widespread backlash against the Kazkah star. Bublik has been labelled by some fans as a ‘Kyrgios-wannabe' for his antics both on and off the court in recent years.Bublik has developed a reputation for his eccentric but often foolish actions on court, and most recently came under fire in last month's Moselle Open final in Metz. The world no.43 appeared to give up in the second set of his showdown against Lorenzo Sonego, in an incident that completely baffled and bewildered spectators.
