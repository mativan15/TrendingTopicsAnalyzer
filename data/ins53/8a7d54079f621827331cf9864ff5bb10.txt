Three historic aircraft will now permanently call the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum (CWHM) their home after the gallery acquired ownership of planes.
The Supermarine Spitfire, Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck, and North American Sabre, on display for several years via donation, are now the property of the Hamilton-based museum after Ingenium and its Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa gifted the aircraft.CWHM's marketing manager Al Mickeloff says ownership now opens up the cockpits to the museum, allowing it to restore the pieces that had been collecting dust for several years.
