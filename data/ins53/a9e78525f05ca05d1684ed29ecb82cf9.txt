Robert van Royen is a Stuff sports reporter OPINION: Too big, too strong and too fast. The Black Ferns hosed Scotland 57-0 in Whangārei on Saturday to romp through pool play unbeaten at the World Cup. In a game they weren't required to do a heck of a lot defending, the Kiwis ran amok, scoring nine tries at the Northland Events Centre. Here are Stuff's player ratings from the victory. Renee Holmes: Opened the scoring inside two minutes and went on to score a second try in her 22-point haul. Slotted six from nine off the tee, including a conversion from out wide late in the first half.
