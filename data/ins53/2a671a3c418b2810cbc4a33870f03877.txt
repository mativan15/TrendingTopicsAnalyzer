Former celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti was sentenced in New York to four years behind bars for stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from his most famous client, porn star Stormy Daniels.The prison term handed down Thursday by US District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan is the second in less than a year for Avenatti, who represented Daniels in an explosive lawsuit against Donald Trump when he was president. Furman said a lengthy prison term was warranted because Avenatti's deception of Daniels "was so brazen and egregious," regardless of whether the lawyer intended to pay her back.
