Fuel cell manufacturer Plug Power Inc. (Nasdaq: PLUG) is growing its green hydrogen footprint in Houston and other areas of Texas.

The Latham, New York-based company now has around 300 employees based in Houston, CEO Andy Marsh said. Earlier this year, Plug Power acquired Houston-based engineered equipment and services provider Joule Processing. The firm expects Joule's technology to cut electric costs for liquefying hydrogen by 25%.
