Shopify (SHOP 4.87%) shareholders beat the market this week as the stock jumped 14% through Thursday trading. That boost compared to a strong 2.3% rally in the S&P 500, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Yet shares remain in deeply negative territory over the broader 2022 year.
Shopify's spike this week came as investors grew less pessimistic about the economy as third-quarter earnings results started rolling in. It was also powered by a general rebound among those hard-hit tech stocks.
