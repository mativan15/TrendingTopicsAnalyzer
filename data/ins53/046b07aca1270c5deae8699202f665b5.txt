As every investor would know, not every swing hits the sweet spot. But you want to avoid the really big losses like the plague. So consider, for a moment, the misfortune of Serinus Energy plc (LON:SENX) investors who have held the stock for three years as it declined a whopping 88%. That'd be enough to cause even the strongest minds some disquiet. And over the last year the share price fell 46%, so we doubt many shareholders are delighted. We really hope anyone holding through that price crash has a diversified portfolio.
