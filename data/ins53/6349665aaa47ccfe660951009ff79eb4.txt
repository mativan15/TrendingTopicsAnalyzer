A solar power world record has been now broken with a "miracle material" called  perovskite. This material allowed researchers to pass the 30% efficiency barrier with silicon solar cells for the first time.The research was undertaken by a team from various universities and institutes in the Netherlands. They used a tandem solar cell to complement traditional silicon-based cells. The latter have an energy conversion efficiency of around 22% and the properties of perovskite. UnsplashWhy achieving more than 30% efficiency is a big dealAccording to the researchers, achieving more than 30% efficiency with the tandem device marked "a big step in accelerating the energy transition" and would also help reduce dependency on fossil fuels.
