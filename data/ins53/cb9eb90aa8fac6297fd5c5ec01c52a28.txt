Published: 03:19 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 03:19 EDT, 20 October 2022 Naked Wines has slashed its sales guidance for the year after a slowdown in customer demand, and launched an overhaul of its board and spending plans. The boss of the online wine retailer told shareholders that the company 'made mistakes' in pursuit of rapid growth and will now prioritise profitability to ensure its sustainable future. Nick Devlin said the business built up stock and grew its costs in anticipation of growth 'which has not been delivered'.
