The U.S. Department of Justice has again signaled its willingness to hold corporate boards accountable for breaking the law.  On Wednesday, it announced that seven directors at five companies resigned after the DOJ raised concerns about antitrust violations. The directors in question were in potential violation of Section 8 of the Clayton Act, an obscure century-old law that bans executives from serving on the boards of competing companies. 'Competitors sharing officers or directors further concentrates power and creates the opportunity to exchange competitively sensitive information and facilitate coordination—all to the detriment of the economy and the American public,' Jonathan Kanter, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, said in a statement on Wednesday.
