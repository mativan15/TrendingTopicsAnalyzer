Three major, crypto industry trade groups have filed an amicus brief supporting a Grayscale Investments lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for rejecting the firm's proposal for a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF).

In the brief submitted Tuesday to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the Blockchain Association, the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Coin Center noted that the SEC had "categorically denied every proposal to list an exchange traded product (ETP)" that tracks bitcoin's spot price, despite approving multiple Bitcoin futures ETPs.
