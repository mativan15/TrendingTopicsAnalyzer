Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, announced Tuesday it was selling Giphy after U.K. regulators ruled the company's acquisition limited competition.

Meta had been ordered in Nov. 2021 to sell the GIF-sharing website and appealed, but the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority rejected Meta's claims and concluded the company needed to sell to an approved buyer.

The ruling marks the first time a global regulator has been able to stop a deal by one of the tech giants.

During the appeal process, Giphy claimed no other company would buy it because GIFs 'have fallen out of fashion as a content form, with younger users in particular describing GIFs as ‘for boomers' and ‘cringe,'' citing the decline in uploads to the platform.
