Oct. 14—Pastor Bob Ross understands the need for scholarship programs that open the door to private schools for lower income students.

He sees it each year at his school — Heritage Baptist Academy, a school tucked into the small Heritage Baptist Church along Lowry Avenue in Jeannette — where families in need often utilize grant dollars to help cover tuition costs.

"It helps the lower income families and families from failing school districts. ... It helps them to be able to afford the tuition and afford to be able to come to the school," Ross said.
