Dzmitry Dzemidovich BofA Securities analyst Mihir Bhatla downgraded FleetCor (NYSE:FLT) to Neutral as outlook for demand weakens due to higher risk of recession, lower freight/trucking demand, and increased interest rates. Those same dynamics led the analyst to reduce target multiples and price objectives for FLT and for Wex (WEX). In addition, he sees factors unique to FleetCor (FLT) that will limit the stock's upside potential. Bhatla now puts a 12x price/earnings multiple to BofA's 2023 EPS estimate compared with the previous multiple of 16.
