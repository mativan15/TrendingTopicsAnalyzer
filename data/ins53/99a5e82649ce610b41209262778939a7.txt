Finishing a degree can be the least of a person's worries when they don't know where their next meal is coming from or where they'll sleep at night.

A new survey of more than 80,000 community college students found a third of respondents said they already struggled to get enough food to eat within the last month. The same survey found about a quarter of students who had to pay rent struggled at least once in the last year to cover their housing costs.

Students who are focused on meeting their basic needs generally can't direct their full attention to their coursework, which could lead to them dropping out at a time when community college enrollment already has fallen sharply.
