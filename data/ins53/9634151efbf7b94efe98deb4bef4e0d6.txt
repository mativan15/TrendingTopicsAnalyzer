June is typically a quiet period for the stock market, which would be a relief after this spring's wild swings. But due to the Federal Reserve's rate hikes, economic uncertainty and geopolitical events, June this year is unlikely to follow the historic pattern of low volatility and shallow gains. Even if the market does rally, it is likely to prove temporary, analysts say. Since 1945, according to CFRA, the S & P 500's average June gain of 0.14% is in the bottom third in terms of monthly performance.
