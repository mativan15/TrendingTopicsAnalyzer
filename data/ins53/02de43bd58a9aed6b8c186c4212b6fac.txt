Sheryl Sandberg will leave her post as head of operations at Meta, Facebook's parent company, later this year. Sandberg has been CEO Mark Zuckerberg's right-hand-woman since becoming COO in 2008 and will remain on the company's board of directors."When I took this job in 2008, I hoped I would be in this role for five years," Sandberg said in a Facebook post announcing the news. "Fourteen years later, it is time for me to write the next chapter of my life.
