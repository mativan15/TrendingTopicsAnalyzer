Love Island star Toby Aromolaran has spoken out after his rumoured split from Chloe Burrows.
The couple were runners up on series seven of the hit dating show – which saw Millie Court and Liam Reardon taking the crown.
Over the weekend, Chloe, 27, told her Instagram followers: ‘You know I f***ed off for a week to Morocco with Millie… yo all I had to say was I want to go and she did everything. Millie Court deserves the f***ing world.'
She later added a photo of herself on holiday online and hailed fashionista Millie the ‘best f***ing friend I've ever had.
