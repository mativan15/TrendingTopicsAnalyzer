Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +0.56% COO John Waldron on Thursday characterized the U.S. economic environment as possibly the most complex, dynamic environment he's seen in his career, according to a transcript of his comments at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference. "I'm not going to use any weather analogies," Waldron said, in refence to remarks about a coming "hurricane" from JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon on Wednesday. "You have demand inconsistency and supply inconsistency," Waldron said.
