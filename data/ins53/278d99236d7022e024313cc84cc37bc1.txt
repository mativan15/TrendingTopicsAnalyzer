CHAMPAIGN — Illinois coach Brad Underwood believes a new crop of talent can help his team stay near the top of the Big Ten.

The No. 23 Illini will certainly look a lot different from last season's Big Ten title-sharing team that featured 7-foot All-America center Kofi Cockburn.

'I woke up every night last year knowing I had 20 (points) and 10 (rebounds),' Underwood said. 'That's a pretty good feeling.'

Forward Coleman Hawkins returns a sliver of the Illini's overall production after averaging 5.
