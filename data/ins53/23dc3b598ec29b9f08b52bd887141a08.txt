On the last day of the Cannes Film Festival, American director Kelly Reichardt was asked a question by a (male) reporter in the press conference for Showing Up, her film starring Michelle Williams, set around artists exhibiting their work. What has changed for female directors, the reporter asked?'Well not that much has changed, or you wouldn't ask me the question and put my award in the context of being a woman, I would just be able to be a filmmaker,' she responded.There's no doubt the quantity of women directing movies in the Cannes Film Festival's main Competition section was still an issue.
