NASA confirmed that a giant asteroid is hurtling toward Earth. Does it pose any risk? Just a week after a giant asteroid, much bigger than the tallest building in the World, Burj-Khalifa, passed near Earth, there is another one that will make a close pass soon. According to NASA, a giant rock that measures around 160-feet in size, dubbed 2021 GT2 will fly past the Earth on June 6, 2022. The space agency revealed that the asteroid is hurtling towards our planet at a speed of 26,000 kilometres per hour.
