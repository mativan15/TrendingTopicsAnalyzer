Over-molding has been proposed in recent years as an integrated functional flexible circuit board in a plastic part. This method uses the conventional process for film insert technology. Over-molding has attracted significant attention across many industries due to its potential to deliver different electrical functions in a variety of different part geometries, especially in automotive interiors and home appliances. While it has great application potential, manufacturing challenges continue throughout foil fabrication and injection molding.
