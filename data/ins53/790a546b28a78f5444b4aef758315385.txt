Discord is refreshing its popular chat app with a handful of new features, including one that developers who build tools for the platform have wanted for a long time.
The changes seek to make the community-building app a more versatile place to hang out, with new ways to customize the servers where hundreds of thousands of people regularly gather around games, hobbies or even well-loved creators.
Discord says that more than a third of its chat room-like servers use apps, often referred to as bots, already.
