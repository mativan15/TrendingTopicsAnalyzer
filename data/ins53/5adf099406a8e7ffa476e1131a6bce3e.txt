The ongoing Memorial Day sales are offering some fantastic tech bargains right now, not least on a host of fantastic super-cheap 4K TV deals.One of the best we've spotted so far is this half-price 55-inch Toshiba M550 for $399 (was $799) (opens in new tab) at Best Buy - a set that features a host of high-end features for a price that's really too good to miss.First up, we love its really slick bezel-less design, a nice modern touch which is pretty rare to find on a TV at this price range.
