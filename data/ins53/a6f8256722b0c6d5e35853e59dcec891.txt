May 29—Gov. Chris Sununu signed into law a $100 million fund to compensate victims of abuse at the state's juvenile detention facilities over advocates' objections that the bill's narrow definitions of abuse and limits on payment for survivors "only benefit the perpetrator."

Before Sununu signed the bill into law Friday, officially creating the fund for likely hundreds of people abused as children in the state-run facilities including the Youth Development Center, now known as the Sununu Youth Services Center, the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence sent the governor a blistering letter, underlining criticism the group and other abuse-survivor advocates raised as the bill made its way through the Legislature.
