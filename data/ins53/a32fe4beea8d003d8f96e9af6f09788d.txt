It's the same thing over and over again. No, not the Green Bay Packers underperforming every week – although that is also true – but head coach Matt LaFleur admitting that running back Aaron Jones didn't get enough carries after a poor offensive showing.

Jones is the Packers' best weapon on offense, yet he has been an afterthought for much of the 2022 season.

Over the last two games, Jones has just 27 total touches over 22 offensive possessions.

It's baffling, especially when you consider that in two of Green Bay's three wins this year, Jones carried the ball at least 15 times.
