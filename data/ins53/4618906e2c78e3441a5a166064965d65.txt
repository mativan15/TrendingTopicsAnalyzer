Its pretty natural for so many AI enthusiastic graduates to take up their Masters right off their completion of graduation. Its well appreciated thought, but what exactly the real industry looking for ? A Master's graduated person or else 2 years real time industry level projects experienced?Well…I would say based upon your circumstances. The primary influencing factor is What exactly you want to be? If you wanted to be a AI engineer or else a Data Scientist, many experts would point out to take up a job in an Organization and work for real life industry level projects rather than going for masters.
