In a video leading up to her final performance, Blair, who revealed in 2018 that she has multiple sclerosis, said that recent MRI results are the reason for her sudden departure, which came just a month after the season premiere. "The results came back, and it just all adds up to I can't go on with the competition," she said in a tearful conversation with her dance partner, Sasha Farber.
