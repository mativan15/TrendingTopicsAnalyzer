Shakira has seemingly made reference to her doomed romance with Gerard Pique in a new song, following their split.
Earlier this year, the Hips Don't Lie singer announced that her relationship with the Barcelona footballer, 35, was over after more than a decade together.
In her new song, titled Monotonia, the 45-year-old appeared to aim some of the lyrics at the athlete – who she shares two children with.
‘It's a necessary goodbye. What used to be incredible became routine,' she could be heard singing in Spanish.
