In his first season after being fired at USC, Clay Helton has scored a few notable wins at Georgia Southern in 2022.His Eagles haven't dominated the competition, but Georgia Southern has made national news on two different occasions this year.The first instance in which Helton hit the headlines in 2022 was his victory over Scott Frost and Nebraska in Lincoln. The victory this past September caused Nebraska administrators to fire Frost and move ahead with their head coaching search, which is exactly what happened to Helton himself in September of 2021.
