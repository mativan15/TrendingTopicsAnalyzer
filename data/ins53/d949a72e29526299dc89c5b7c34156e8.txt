"China and India are expected to become the world's largest and third largest economies respectively in the next decade while their consumers will increasingly dictate global tastes and trends," Bird said. Abrdn – which has around $586.35 billion in assets under management as of most recent results – has observed that interest in sustainable investment among local investors is also on the rise.
