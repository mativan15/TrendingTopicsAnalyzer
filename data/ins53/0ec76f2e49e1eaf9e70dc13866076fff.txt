We lost six undefeated teams over the course of Week 7.

With three matchups of unbeaten teams, we knew we were going to officially end the middle week of the 2022 season with no more than 12 undefeated teams remaining. And that number officially stands at nine at the conclusion of the weekend thanks to a heartbreaking one-point loss by USC in Salt Lake City and losses by the Sun Belt's Coastal Carolina and James Madison.

With nine undefeated teams left ahead of the final six weeks of the season we figured it'd be a good time to rank them.
