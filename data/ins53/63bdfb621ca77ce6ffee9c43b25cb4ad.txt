May 29—The roads on Kokomo's courthouse square will be closed off Friday. Instead of cars, roughly 100 booths will fill the streets in celebration of the 2022 Strawberry Festival.

Although many aspects of the festival will be familiar, there are several changes coming this year.

For example, the Artsapalooza art market is joining the festival this year. Twenty artists will sell their work in front of the Kokomo Artworks Gallery at 210 N. Main St.

Several artists will have live demonstrations to show visitors how the artwork is made.
