Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev recently made some shocking claims against Bollywood during his speech at Aryaveer and Veerangana conference in Moradabad. He said, "Salman Khan takes drugs, I do not know about Aamir Khan. Shah Rukh Khan`s child was caught while taking drugs and remained in jail. As far as actresses are concerned, God alone knows about them." He further added, "There are drugs all around the film industry, there are drugs in politics too. Liquor is distributed during elections. We should take a resolution that India must be free from every drug addiction.
