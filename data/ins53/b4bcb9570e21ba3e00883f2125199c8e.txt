New claims of more than $1 billion in 'unjust enrichment' against current and former Jeld-Wen Holding Inc. insiders have led to a proposed $13.5 million settlement of a lawsuit involving allegations of breach of duty.

U.S. District Court Judge Richard Andrews in Delaware granted preliminary approval of the settlement last week. A fairness hearing for the settlement has been set for December before final approval.

The lawsuit is a derivative suit filed by Jeld-Wen (NYSE: JELD) shareholders to recover company damages from current and former board members and executives accused of profiting from anticompetitive actions and other hidden improprieties.
