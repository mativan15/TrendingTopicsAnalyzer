Israel's international tech reputation has received another notch in its belt as Israeli travel management company Atriis was selected and appointed as the global Corporate Travel platform for the government of The Netherlands.

The agreement was signed following an extensive 18-month tender process and will last for a period of 8 years, a notably long-term arrangement that will see the Israeli start-up playing a pivotal role in the Dutch government's travel planning and management.

'We selected Atriis primarily because it provides the simplicity of the booking journey with a maximum worldwide offer of any relevant travel services we need,' explained Bas de Rijk, Head of Travelpoint 3W, for the Government of the Netherlands.
