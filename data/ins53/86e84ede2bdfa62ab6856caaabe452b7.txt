The two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep failed a doping test at the US Open, the International Tennis Integrity Agency has announced. The world No 9 tested positive for the anti-anaemia drug Roxadustat in New York and has been provisionally suspended.Halep, who won the French Open in 2018 and Wimbledon the following year, is the highest-profile tennis player to fail a drugs test since Maria Sharapova six years ago. The Romanian, who suffered a shock loss to Daria Snigur in the first round of the US Open, brought her season to an end last month following nasal surgery.
