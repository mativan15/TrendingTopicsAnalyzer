Liz Truss is resigning as Conservative Party leader and UK Prime Minister after just 45 days, becoming the shortest-serving Prime Minister in British history.

'I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party,' Truss said in a very brief speech outside 10 Downing Street.

'I have therefore spoken to His Majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party.'

Truss, the former Foreign Secretary, won the Conservative leadership election among MPs and party members earlier this year after the resignation of Boris Johnson.
