The Downing Street chief of staff lobbied ministers, including Liz Truss, for a politician he falsely claimed was Libya's 'legitimate prime minister' as part of a paid campaign to change UK foreign policy.Mark Fullbrook, who previously ran his own lobbying company, spent this spring pressing the government to diverge from the official stance taken by the UN and US and recognise the authority of Fathi Bashagha, who led a failed military bid to storm Tripoli this year.In June Fullbrook organised a visit to London for Bashagha that had not been approved by No 10 or the Foreign Office.
