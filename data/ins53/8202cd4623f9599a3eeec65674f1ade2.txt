The marine animals and oceans-focused theme park SeaWorld is opening several never-before-made rides including the world's first surf coaster.
SeaWorld announced that it will unveil the first coaster mimicking riding a wave in Orlando, the world's first launched flume coaster in San Antonio and the longest and fastest straddle coaster on the West Coast in San Diego. The rides in each of the parks will debut in 2023. 
SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment CEO Marc Swanson on Tuesday stated: ‘2023 promises to be another exciting year for our SeaWorld parks as we introduce more new rides and experiences that cannot be found elsewhere.
