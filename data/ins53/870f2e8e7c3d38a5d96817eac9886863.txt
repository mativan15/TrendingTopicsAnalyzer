The US has charged five Russian nationals and two oil traders in a global sanctions evasions and money-laundering scheme involving Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA.

The 12-count indictment unsealed Wednesday in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges the seven engaged in a scheme in which they obtained military technology from US companies, smuggled millions of barrels of sanctioned oil and laundered tens of millions of dollars for Russian oligarchs and sanctioned entities. Two of the Russians were arrested in Germany and Italy on Monday.
