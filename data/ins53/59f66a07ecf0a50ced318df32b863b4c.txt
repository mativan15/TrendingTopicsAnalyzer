Political and economic instability has prompted lenders to regard the British economy as similar to Italy and Greece, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England has said.Sir Charlie Bean, who was deputy governor for monetary policy from 2008 to 2014, said it was 'disingenuous' of the government to say the market turmoil is 'all a global phenomenon'.Speaking on the Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme on Sky News, Bean, who is a professor at the London School of Economics, said there is a 'global element' to the UK's rise in interest rates and 'three quarters or two thirds maybe is the world'.
