National has released its 'bold new approach' to social investment, promising data-driven decisions that will benefit New Zealanders most at need. But the Government says it's just a rehash of old policies that haven't worked. National deputy Nicola Willis gave a nod to Sir Bill English during her speech on Wednesday in Wellington, figuratively in terms of reigniting the former prime minister's social investment policy and literally because he was sitting in the audience. Speaking at Victoria University, Willis said she wanted results that count – promising to make use of data and evidence, while taking a ‘people and outcomes focus' to improve social outcomes.
