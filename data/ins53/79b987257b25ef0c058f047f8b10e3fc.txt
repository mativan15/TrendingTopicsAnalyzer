JHVEPhoto Introduction & Purpose Aritzia Inc. (TSX:ATZ:CA, OTCPK:ATZAF) reported Q2 2023 earnings that exceeded analysts' revenue expectations and provided a spark to an underperforming apparel sector. The company's brands continued to impress throughout the quarter, and their U.S. focus has generated strong returns, up 80% year-over-year. My recent article on ATZ:CA showcased a bull view, and these results proved that key tailwinds remain intact. While the global economy and the retail apparel sector as a whole will remain challenged as rates rise and supply chain woes drag on, ATZ:CA remains one of a select few growth stocks in apparel.
