Ravens rookie tight end Charlie Kolar, sidelined for nearly two months by a sports hernia, has been cleared to return to practice.

The fourth-round pick underwent surgery in early August to address the hernia, a strain or tear of any soft tissue in the lower abdomen or groin area. Kolar, who had a sports hernia at Iowa State that required surgery in 2020, missed the full-team portion of Ravens training camp.

With the 6-foot-6 Kolar set to practice, the Ravens will have 21 days to move him to their 53-man roster or place him on season-ending injured reserve.
