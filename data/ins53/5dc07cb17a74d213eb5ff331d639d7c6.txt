The Indian Constitution equates education with charity and it can never be treated as business, commerce or trade, the Supreme Court stressed on Wednesday while ruling that a charitable institution will be entitled to tax relief only if it does not engage in any profit-making activity.Section 10(23C) of the 1961 Income Tax Act provides for tax exemption to charitable trusts, societies or institutions existing 'solely' for educational purposes and not for the purposes of profit.The word 'solely' was, however, interpreted by two previous judgments of the top court in 2008 and 2015 to mean that the test for determination was whether the principal or main activity was education or not, rather than whether some profits were incidentally earned.
