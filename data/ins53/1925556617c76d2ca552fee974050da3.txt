By Ian Walker XPS Pensions Group PLC on Thursday raised its full-year guidance for fiscal 2023 after a strong first-half performance which was driven by growth in all its business units. The U.K. pensions consultancy said revenue for the six months ended Sept. 30 rose 14% and was up 13% on an organic basis. "Our pipeline is the strongest it has ever been, and we hope to add more new clients during the second half of the year and beyond," Chief Executive Paul Cuff said. The company didn't provide any full-year figures.
