Republicans in Congress are sounding alarms over a partnership agreement between the NewsGuard ‘disinformation' service and a major teachers' union, arguing the tool is prone to bias and the union is deliberately politicizing American students.In letters sent to both NewsGuard and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), GOP Representatives Virginia Foxx (North Carolina), Jim Banks (Indiana), and Burgess Owens (Utah) slammed the two organizations for a 'history of demonstrating left-wing bias,' according to Fox News.
