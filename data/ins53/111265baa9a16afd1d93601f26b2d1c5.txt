Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told Fox Business there are several products changing the tech landscape with potential for growth in the coming years, giving his company a unique opportunity for growth.  Amon said Qualcomm is fortunate that the company is growing, and has not slowed or paused hiring, like many other tech companies."We're finding new end markets for technology, and I think that's driving the growth," Amon told Fox Business. "We look at the environment right now, it's probably a good environment to invest," he said, adding that the company is actively looking at new mergers and acquisitions.
