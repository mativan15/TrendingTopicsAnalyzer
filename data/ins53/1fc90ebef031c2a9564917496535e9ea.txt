In a major controversy, a question paper for class 7th students in Bihar's Kishanganj has described Kashmir as a distinct nation. The question that appeared in the test was "What are the people of particular countries called?", in which Kashmir along with India, China, England, and Nepal was listed in the English half-yearly exam. The Bihar education department has come under scrutiny as a result of this controversial question. With verbal battle between the opposition and the ruling parties, BJP has criticised the state government.
