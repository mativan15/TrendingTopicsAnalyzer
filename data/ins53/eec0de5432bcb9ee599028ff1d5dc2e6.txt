France's Commission d'enrichissement de la langue française has decided to offer citizens new terms to describe video games.
The Commission's mission is to create new terms that replace terms coined in foreign languages that become part of common speech in France, so that the local language doesn't have gaps in vocabulary that can't be expressed in French.
On Sunday, the French ministry of culture therefore issued new guidance [PDF] about how to discuss video games in French. French speakers have been encouraged to ditch terms such as 'cloud gaming' in favor of jeu vidéo en nuage' Retro gaming becomes 'rétrojeu video', or jus 'rétrojeu'.
