The governor of California has announced he has Covid-19, the morning after meeting Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. Gavin Newsom, who signed a memorandum of cooperation on climate change with Ardern during their meeting on Saturday, tweeted that he had tested positive. 'This AM, I tested positive for Covid-19 and am currently experiencing mild symptoms. Grateful to be vaccinated & for treatments like Paxlovid. I'm following health guidelines and will be isolating while I work remotely.' The news should not affect Ardern's trip to the White House at this point, because she tested positive for Covid-19 over two weeks ago and is fully recovered.
