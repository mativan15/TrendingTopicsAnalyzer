"Terrifier 2" director Damien Leone responded to reports of audience members "fainting" and "vomiting."

"I don't want people fainting, getting hurt during the movie," Leone told Entertainment Weekly.

Leone warned viewers to prepare by watching Art the clown in the original "Terrifier."

"Terrifier 2" proved to be too much to handle for some horror fans during its opening weekend. The slasher sequel premiered in theatres on October 6 and climbed to the top 10 at the box office, earning more than four times what it cost to make, according to Yahoo Entertainment.
