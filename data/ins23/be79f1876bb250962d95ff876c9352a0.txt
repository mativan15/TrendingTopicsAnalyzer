Late last night, Fedor Linnik discovered that any crypto enthusiast's nightmare had become his reality. The NFT collection he was planning to launch — 8,888 unique Goblin Asses — had been hijacked.

Just as Linnik and his friends were planning to launch Goblinass.town, they discovered a scammer had copied their thousands of cartoons of goblin butts and posted them as their own collection on OpenSea. The heist was first reported by the blog Web3 Is Going Great.

Why goblin asses? Well, see, the NFTs were inspired by the surprisingly successful collection Goblintown.
