The actress Charlotte Rithice, 33, on enjoying lengthy Tripadvisor reviews, drunken injuries and not getting hangry on holiday.
How are you today? 
Sorry, I got my finger trapped in a door so I've got a kind of bandage on it. It's so painful. It's crazy. 
How did you do it? 
Not sure. I'd had a few whiskies, and I closed the door funny in the pub loo and it was trapped. I was howling in pain but laughing as well. I was very drunk. It was an accident. I didn't mean to get that drunk. I haven't been that drunk in ages.
