Collider.com The mockumentary format has become an essential subgenre for comedic filmmaking. Filmmakers like Christopher Guest are considered at the forefront of this style of comedy, with projects like Best in Show (2000), Waiting for Guffman (1996), and A Mighty Wind (2003) all being considered modern comedic classics. Just like in film, the mockumentary format has also found a home within the world of television. There are almost too many examples to count, but certainly, some of the most popular examples include the vampire television adaptation of What We Do in the Shadows (2019-2022), and we'd be remiss not to mention hit sitcoms like The Office (2005-2013), Parks and Recreation (2009-2015), and Abbott Elementary (2021-2022).
