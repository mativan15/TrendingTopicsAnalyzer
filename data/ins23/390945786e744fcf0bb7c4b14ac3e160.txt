After launching its inaugural school of engineering earlier this year and raising pre-seed funding, Nigeria's AltSchool has expanded its catalog to include data and product schools, responding to the growing demand for these technical skills by youth and employers.
Among the new courses are product marketing, design and management, and data science, engineering and analysis. This is in addition to a software engineering course where students specialize in either frontend, backend, and cloud engineering.
