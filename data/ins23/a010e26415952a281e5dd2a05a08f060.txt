A look at the shareholders of Trustmark Corporation (NASDAQ:TRMK) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$2.1b in market cap. The one-year return on investment is currently 7.0% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.
