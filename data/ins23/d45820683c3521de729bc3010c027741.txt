West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday waded into the controversy surrounding Sourav Ganguly's impending exit from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), saying she will request Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow the former India cricketer and BCCI chief to contest for the position of International Cricket Council's (ICC) chairperson.
Banerjee wondered why Ganguly did not get renominated for a second term as BCCI president even as BCCI secretary Jay Shah, Union Home Minister Amit Shah's son, is set to continue in his position.
