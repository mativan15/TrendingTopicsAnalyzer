It was right around this time last year that Formula One's growth in the U.S. became clear, as Circuit of The Americas was preparing to host a record crowd and ESPN was reporting spiking ratings. Now, a year later, F1 returns to COTA as a more established property in America and one seeking to take its business to the next level.

Bobby Epstein, chairman of COTA, expects that the track will host well over 400,000 people during the three-day weekend starting Oct. 21 and break its own attendance record with the F1 Aramco U.
