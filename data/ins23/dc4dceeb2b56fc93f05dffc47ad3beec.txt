Since then, growth of fintech brokerages and robo-advisers has softened and reversed now that stimulus payments are in the past and inflation is eating away at consumers' disposable income. That's likely to continue, said Morning Consult in a recent report. "First, the end of stimulus payments, followed by high inflation, means less discretionary income and ever-dwindling financial cushions for consumers, resulting in less 'play money' for those who used personally managed brokerage accounts or robo-advisors to dip their toes into the investing world," said Morning Consult's Charlotte Principato.
