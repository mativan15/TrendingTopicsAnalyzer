HC Wainwright initiated coverage of Lyell Immunopharma Inc (NASDAQ: LYEL) with a Buy rating and a price target of $12 per share.

Lyell leverages two ex vivo epigenetic reprogramming technologies, Gen-R and Epi-R, which are designed to generate T-cell populations that are more effective and resilient.

The analyst believes the technologies position Lyell as a solid tumor cell therapy leader.

LYL845 is a tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy designed to incorporate the Epi-R technology.
