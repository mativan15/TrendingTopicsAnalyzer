Former rugby player James Haskell says other clubs could go into administration, following Wasps and Worcester Warriors.

Both Premiership outfits have gone under this season, seeing the players and backroom staff made redundant. Haskell, who played for Wasps in two spells when he was in the game, says change needs to happen to prevent other sides following suit.

'It's devastating. Your thoughts are with the players and staff, and it's not just the immediate people you think about, it's all the support staff,' he told Sky Sports.
