An executive producer from the horror movie Terrifier 2 has likened watching the movie with riding a rollercoaster.

The film has gained popularity after reports of people throwing up and fainting in cinemas while watching it.

Steve Barton spoke to Tech & Science Daily about the movie, reactions, and why people enjoy the horror genre.

TikTok is introducing an adults-only option for live streams.

TikTok said some content can be unsuitable for minors, such as some comedy routines or when a host wants to discuss a 'difficult life experience'.
