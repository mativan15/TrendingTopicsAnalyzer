The government has disbanded the multi-disciplinary monitoring agency (MDMA) constituted within the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate a wider international conspiracy angle in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, and transferred the case to one of its regular branches, people familiar with the development said. MDMA, which was set up in 1998 on the recommendations of the Justice M C Jain Commission of Inquiry which probed the conspiracy aspect of Gandhi's assassination, was headed by deputy inspector general (DIG) rank officer of CBI and comprised of 4-5 officers from Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), Intelligence Bureau (IB) and Revenue Intelligence at the time of its disbanding.
