KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwait's crown prince, in a tearful speech at Tuesday's opening of parliament, urged the legislative and executive branches to focus on the country's development and put an end a prolonged feud and "petty matters" that have wasted time and money.

Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah took over most of the ruling emir's duties late last year and has since largely focused on tackling domestic political bickering that has long plagued the wealthy Gulf Arab state, hampering investment and key reforms.
