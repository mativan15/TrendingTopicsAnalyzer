Marci Liroff wants you to know one thing for certain: 'This is not porn. This is make-believe.'
Liroff worked as the intimacy coordinator on Season 2 of the Starz drama 'Hightown,' which features plenty of sex and stripping — but did not have anyone to coach those scenes in the first season.
'I thought they did a terrific and convincing job in the first season without an intimacy coordinator,' she tells Variety. 'But I knew I could make it better.'
Intimacy coordinators started to be more in demand after #MeToo era conversations about sexual misconduct on film and TV sets expanded to include the ethics and protocol surrounding on-screen sex.
