VICTORIA - Anjali Appadurai says she knows she's upset the New Democratic Party establishment, but that shouldn't keep her out of the race for the party leadership. The former federal NDP candidate entered the contest to succeed retiring Premier John Horgan in August with promises of transformative change on environmental and social issues, but has yet to receive official approval of her candidacy.A party decision on Appadurai's candidacy is expected Wednesday following reviews of membership sign-up concerns connected to her campaign launched by the NDP and Elections BC, the legislature's independent, non-partisan office responsible for administering electoral processes in the province.
