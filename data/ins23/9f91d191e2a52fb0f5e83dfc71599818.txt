It's easy to match the overall market return by buying an index fund. When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. Investors in Silk Road Medical, Inc (NASDAQ:SILK) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 30%. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 25%. On the bright side, the stock is actually up 19% in the last three years. Even worse, it's down 8.1% in about a month, which isn't fun at all.
