Even the pharma industry gets annual pricing indexed to inflation, says Hina Nagarajan, managing director at USL.United Spirits, India's biggest spirits firm, said it is seeking a standard pricing policy linked to inflation from the government instead of frequently approaching every state individually for price revision and to offset increased costs. 'Medium to longer term, if they were able to give us an inflation-indexed pricing policy, that would be amazing for the industry as well as their revenues,' Hina Nagarajan, managing director at USL, told ET.
