Lake Olmstead Stadium in Augusta was supposed to undergo major renovations ahead of XPR Augusta, but since the show was canceled on March 30, construction has stopped.

Angela Sims of Evans said she tried calling XPR Augusta and its organizers at C4 Live at least 25 times trying to get her refund, and while she eventually got her money back, Sims said of the whole process: "It's been a nightmare."

XPR Augusta announced on its social media pages May 31 that final refunds have been distributed to all accounts, but many customers remain angry, concerned and disappointed they said.
