New York Jets coach Robert Saleh isn't willing to trade wide receiver Elijah Moore after his tumultuous week with the organization .

He's not going to try and get him to play this weekend, either.

Saleh confirmed Friday that Moore — who requested a trade on Thursday after airing his frustrations with how the team was using him days earlier — won't travel with the team to Denver for their game with the Broncos on Sunday. He will instead be inactive, and will stay in New Jersey.

"To ask him to play a football game with where he is from a mental standpoint wouldn't be fair to him, in my opinion," Saleh said, via ESPN .
