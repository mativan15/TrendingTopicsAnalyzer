Somewhere in between those bulky over-ear headphones and tiny earbuds is a more classic style: on-ear headphones. And with on-ear headphones, you really get to enjoy the best of both worlds. That's because on-ear headphones have the benefit of having speakers large enough to produce hi-fi sound (the way over-ear headphones do) while remaining compact enough to stow away for easy transport (like earbuds). The makers of quality on-ear options can pack the ear cups full of technology, like active noise cancellation and radio frequency tech, while ensuring that the headphones are still lightweight and produce great audio full of rich bass and crisp mids.
