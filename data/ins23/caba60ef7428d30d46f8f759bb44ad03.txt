Believe it or not, the Knicks were once a bigger deal than the Yankees. The baseball team kept winning championships, and the basketball team kept failing to win them, and it did not matter. 
'We had both on our network, MSG,' Dave Checketts, former Garden president, once told me, 'and the Knicks were the bigger team. 
'I even remember George Steinbrenner saying he'd wait to announce something until the Knicks' playoffs were over. It was good to hear.' 
But Checketts admitted that the fascination with the '90s Knicks was, in part, tethered to their repeated and failed postseason duels with the greatest player ever, Michael Jordan, whose Bulls eliminated the Knicks five times between 1989 and 1996; Chicago lost a Game 7 at the Garden in '94 when MJ was off playing minor league baseball.
