By Reuters Published: 00:24 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 00:24 EDT, 21 October 2022 BENGALURU, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Indian shares opened higher on Friday, as strong earnings reports, including from Axis Bank, helped resist the weakness in global markets on fears of the impact of aggressive rate hikes from central banks on economic growth and corporate results. The NSE Nifty 50 index was 0.32% higher at 17,619.65, as of 0348 GMT, while the S&P BSE Sensex climbed 0.34% at 59,406.65. Both indexes were set to add to a five-session rally If the gains hold, the indexes will likely post their biggest weekly rise since late July, despite weak investor sentiment globally for risk assets.
