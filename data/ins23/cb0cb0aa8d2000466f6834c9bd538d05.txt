New York CNN Business —

McDonald's is adding a new menu item from an unusual source: One of its rivals.

Beginning October 26, nine locations in Louisville, Kentucky will start selling Krispy Kreme donuts as part of a test to 'inform future menu decisions,' both companies announced Tuesday. It's an unusual move since the two chains compete for breakfast customers and McDonald's has its own line of pastries as part of its McCafé lineup.

Krispy Kreme will deliver the donuts daily to the participating restaurants and customers can purchase them individually or in six packs.
