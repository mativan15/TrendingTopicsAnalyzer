A Rocksteady developer has described the Xbox Series S as a ‘potato' that has ‘hamstrung' modern games on next gen consoles.
To most people the Xbox Series S is the best bargain of the generation, especially when combined with Xbox Game Pass. It's significantly cheaper than the Xbox Series X and yet runs all the same games, with the only apparent drawback being no native 4K support and a lack of a disc drive.
However, on paper it is considerably less powerful than either of the more expensive next gen consoles and one developer claims that it's actually holding back the entire generation, since it becomes the lowest common denominator that all multiformat games must support.
