By Shawn Chitnis May 28, 2022 / 7:04 PM / CBS San Francisco NAPA (KPIX) -- Restaurateurs participating in the 2022 BottleRock music festival say exposure from the event comes at a critical time for businesses looking to navigate their ongoing recovery from the pandemic."I think Napa has rebounded better than you could have imagined," said Eric Keffer, owner of Cole's Chop House. "We had an awakening and we had a moral compass to make decisions for employees who had no other source of income."Cole's has been in business for 22 years and the fine dining establishment says 2021 was one of their best years but it required them to make major changes to stay open -- like accepting takeout and delivery orders.
