Recent statistical analysis suggests that child abuse did not increase during pandemic lockdowns despite anecdotal evidence to the contrary, a panel of child welfare experts said Tuesday. Dr. Robert Sege, a pediatrician who specializes in treating child abuse patients at Tufts Medical Center, said during the virtual panel that reports of child abuse declined by 50% during the first months of pandemic lockdowns from March to December 2020. He credited federal pandemic aid programs with keeping the number down, noting that families 'did all kinds of things together and drew closer' during the lockdowns.
