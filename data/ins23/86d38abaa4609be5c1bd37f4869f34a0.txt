Former PCC chief Ponnala Lakshmaiah criticised the Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao accusing him of camping in New Delhi while his ministers were busy in camp politics in Munugode leaving the administration to its fate. Mr. Lakshmaiah asked the Chief Minister to explain the purpose of his New Delhi visit or else it would be construed that it was to settle some deals in which his family members' names cropped up. He said people expect the CM to take up issues of Telangana with the Centre while sitting in Delhi rather than politicking with his Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) plans.
