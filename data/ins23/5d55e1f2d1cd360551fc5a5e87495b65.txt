DJ Etheridge had more receptions from King's Fork quarterback Cameron Butler than all but one Bulldog receiver.

Only problem was Etheridge plays for Oscar Smith.

The senior had three interceptions that halted drives and several nice returns, including a punt return for a touchdown, to help lead top-ranked Oscar Smith to a 52-21 win over No. 5 King's Fork in a battle of unbeatens.

Oscar Smith woke up the crowd when Alvin Jones returned the opening kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown.

The Tigers (6-0) made it 14-0 when Etheridge returned a punt 60 yards for a score.
