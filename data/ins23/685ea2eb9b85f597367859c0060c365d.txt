I was shook at [ Spoiler (click to open) ] Vader burning Obi Wan, like it makes sense but I was surprised Disney went this dark. I'm also surprised that in a world as high tech as Star Wars, Vader is still so crispy under his helmet. It's what he deserves. Little Leia continues to be amazing and adorable, I love her so much and I'm so happy the show went this direction because I never in a million years expected it.
