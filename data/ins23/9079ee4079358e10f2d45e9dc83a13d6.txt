iStockRepresentative ImageElectric two-wheeler makers are tapping global private equity (PE) funds to propel their expansion plans, as the nascent sector looks set to take off in a big way. Two-wheeler electric vehicle (EV) firms as well as ancillary units are set to raise around $1.5-2 billion from PE firms, with nearly half of this capital already in advanced stages of discussion for infusion soon, investment bankers and founders told ET. Hero Electric, Ather Energy, Pure EV, Simple Energy, , Oben and Ivoomi are likely to witness private capital inflow, they said, with the larger firms looking to raise around $100-250 million each, while the smaller ones seek about $30-60 million each.
