Who doesn't love Super Mario, first introduced in the 1980s as the intrepid star of a well-loved arcade game? Super Mario Kart, a series of racing games, followed, and this is the central theme of TAG Heuer's new watch duo created in collaboration with Nintendo. The timepieces bring to mind the common themes of the TAG Heuer Formula 1 collection and the Mario Kart experience: adrenaline, speed, competitiveness and victory, according to the watch's creators.
