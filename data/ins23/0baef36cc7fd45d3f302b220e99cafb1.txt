It's nice to see the Root, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROOT) share price up 14% in a week. But that isn't much consolation for the painful drop we've seen in the last year. Indeed, the share price is down a whopping 85% in the last year. So it's not that amazing to see a bit of a bounce. The important thing is whether the company can turn it around, longer term. We really hope anyone holding through that price crash has a diversified portfolio. Even when you lose money, you don't have to lose the lesson.

While the stock has risen 14% in the past week but long term shareholders are still in the red, let's see what the fundamentals can tell us.
