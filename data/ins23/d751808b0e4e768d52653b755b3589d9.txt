The United States has recently imposed some of the toughest semiconductor-related sanctions it has ever imposed on China. Using the 'foreign direct product rule', which prohibits the use of American origin technology to the sanctioned party, even for third party countries, the White House has banned China's entire semiconductor industry from utilizing US-led chipmaking equipment, in a bid to slow down its rise in chip technology. It is the same move the US used against Huawei two years ago, but on a larger scale, and demonstrates President Joe Biden's willingness to double down on confrontation with Beijing, forcing it to pursue a path of self-reliance in semiconductors.
