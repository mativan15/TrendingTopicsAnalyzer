(This story originally appeared in on Oct 17, 2022)NEW DELHI: After nearly 22 years serving as Congress party president, Sonia Gandhi will be relinquishing the post on October 19, 2022. Sonia Gandhi, 75, has been at the party's helm since March 14, 1998 -- barring the two years between 2017 and 2019 when Rahul Gandhi took over -- making her the longest-serving president in the party's 137-year-long history. In the period, the party was in power at the Centre for 10 successive years and then hit a historic low -- leaving behind a massive challenge for the next party president.
