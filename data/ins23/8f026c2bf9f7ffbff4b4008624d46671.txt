A video of a small child being kept in a 'cage' underneath a metal pushcart prompted a discussion in China about how a lack of childcare options for poor people could push someone to make such an extreme decision. In a 12-second video circulating online, the boy, who lives in Tongren City, in the southern province of Guizhou, is seen reaching through the bars towards the camera as he moves around what appears to be a makeshift cot. Signage in the video indicates that the mother sells iced jelly desserts for a living.
