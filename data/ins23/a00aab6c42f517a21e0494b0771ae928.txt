Ahead of President Biden's meeting with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell Tuesday, former Trump administration economist Stephen Moore predicted an inflation "plateau" would provide some relief to Americans, but not anytime soon on "Varney & Co." When Stuart Varney asked whether the U.S. will see 10% consumer price inflation this summer, Moore responded: "No." "I actually think we're going to be somewhere in the 6 to 7% range for inflation, which means I think we've plateaued and I think it might actually come down a little bit," the former White House economist explained.
