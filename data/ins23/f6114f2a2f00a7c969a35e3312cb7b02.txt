Today, we present our choices for Toronto Council for Wards 9 through 16:

Ward 9, Davenport: The departure of Ana Bailão has left an open field. Grant Gonzales, co-chair of Pride Toronto, has links to the community through his work with the Davenport-Perth Neighbourhood and Community Health Centre. Shaker Jamal, a representative for the United Steelworkers, has laid out some good ideas on issues such as housing affordability, parks, police reform and city revenue. Alejandro Bravo is likely a familiar name with voters, thanks to past election campaigns and her local advocacy work.
