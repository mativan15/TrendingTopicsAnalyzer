Another day, another NFT marketplace.

VC-backed marketplace Blur launched Wednesday, promising new users free crypto in the form of an airdropped gift which contains an undisclosed amount of BLUR tokens. If you've traded an NFT within the past six months, you may be eligible for the free airdrop—but you won't be able to open the airdrop and access your gift until January 2023.

'To celebrate our launch we're airdropping Care Packages containing $BLUR tokens to everyone who's stuck around in the bear market,' the marketplace wrote on Twitter.
