Now that the High Holy Days are over, let's start planning what should be the most hyped holiday of this year: Israel's 75th birthday. Although Israel was founded on May 14, 1948, its diamond jubilee celebration will be, by the Hebrew calendar, on April 26, 2023, 189 days from today. Although only six months remain to figure out how to celebrate the greatest modern Jewish miracle, few Jewish organizations or Israeli leaders seem to have noticed or started planning.

Last May, I tried triggering some brainstorming about how to celebrate this culmination of the arc of Zionist triumph: starting last August with the Zionist Congress's 125th anniversary, building through this November 29, with the 75th anniversary of the United Nations' 1947 recognition of Israel and culminating with Israel's 75th birthday.
