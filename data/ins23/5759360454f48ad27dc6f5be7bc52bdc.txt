Veteran Himachal Pradesh BJP leader Suresh Bharadwaj currently handles several portfolios as a cabinet minister in the Jairam Thakur-led party government, which include urban development, education and law.
The 70-year-old MLA from the high-profile Shimla constituency, Bharadwaj began his innings in public life from student politics in the RSS' students wing ABVP, becoming its national secretary in 1973. He participated actively in protests during the Emergency and was jailed like many Opposition leaders.
