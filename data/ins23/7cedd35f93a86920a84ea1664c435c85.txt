Last week's mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, has thrown a spotlight on a little-known social media app called Yubo that has a small but growing user base of mostly young people.The French tech startup has received little attention in the U.S., at least from adults, but since the May 24 shooting more than a dozen Yubo users have come forward to say that they interacted with a Yubo user who they believe was the 18-year-old gunman, Salvador Ramos.Their stories highlight a freewheeling culture hosted on the app for young teenagers, and the perpetual migration of young people to new, undermoderated social media platforms.
