President Biden said he would support a federal fund to help women pay for abortion procedures while calling on companies to also help their employees pay for reproductive care.

'The answer is absolutely,' Biden told NowThis News when asked in a recent interview if he supports a federal fund for individuals who need to take time off work or obtain childcare for an abortion.

'I do support that, and I've publicly urged companies to do that. I've urged them publicly as president of the United States saying, ‘This is what you should be doing … I urge you to do it because there's so many, and imagine the women who need that kind of assistance, but have no money at all to be able to do this.
