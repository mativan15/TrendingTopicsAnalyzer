The Karnataka High court has directed the state government to fix the fare of app-based autorickshaw aggregators within 15 days. Till this happens, the court has allowed service providers to also collect 10 per cent additional charge above the fare already fixed by the government, which was last fixed on June 11, 2021. There is a tiff going on between app-based autorickshaw-hailing service and the state government as they were charging surcharge over and above the fare fixed by the government.
