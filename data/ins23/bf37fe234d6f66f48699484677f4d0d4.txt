Liz Truss is due in Parliament this morning for her third Prime Minister's Questions session with MPs. The Labour Party will quiz the Prime Minister less than a week after Jeremy Hunt, her own Chancellor, shredded definitive fiscal plans made by his predecessor, Kwasi Kwarteng. The moment will prove vital for Ms Truss to either unite or further divide Tories, many of whom are in open rebellion with the Government.Today's crunch PMQs will, on the surface, progress like any other.House of Commons organisers have scheduled the session to start at 12pm this afternoon.
