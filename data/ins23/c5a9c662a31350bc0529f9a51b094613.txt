(LEAD) DP leader cries foul over prosecution's attempt to raid headquarters (ATTN: ADDS DP's reaction in last 4 paras) SEOUL, Oct. 20 (Yonhap) -- Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung strongly denounced the prosecution's attempt to raid the headquarters of his Democratic Party as "oppression" of the opposition Thursday and claimed his innocence after a long-time confidant was detained on bribery charges. DP Chairman Lee made the remarks a day after prosecutors apprehended Kim Yong, one of Lee's closest confidants, on bribery charges and attempted unsuccessfully to raid the DP headquarters where Kim's office is located.
