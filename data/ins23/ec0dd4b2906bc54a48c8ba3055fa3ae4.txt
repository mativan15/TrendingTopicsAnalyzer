	Just weeks after the milestone debut of Thursday Night Football as a streaming-only franchise on Prime Video, Amazon and the NFL have announced plans for an annual game on the day after Thanksgiving, aka Black Friday.

	The first contest will be held in 2023 and the venture is open-ended. Amazon acquired rights to TNF for $1 billion per season through 2032. During a press call held to discuss their plans, Amazon and the NFL described the Friday games as a separate venture.
