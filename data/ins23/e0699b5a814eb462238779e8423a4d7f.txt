The Big Steppers tour has taken Kendrick Lamar around the world in support of his fifth studio album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers, and his first in five years. With a recently completed North American leg under his belt and dates in Australia and New Zealand on the horizon, the rapper is using the Paris stop of the European stretch to celebrate how far he's come with a special livestream hosted by Amazon Music and Prime Video. Lamar's sold-out show at the Accor Arena will stream in its entirety on Oct.
