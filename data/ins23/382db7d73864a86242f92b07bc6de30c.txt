Bargain Hunt viewers were furious with antiques expert Catherine Southon after watching an old episode of the BBC series. The episode originally aired in May 2019, but viewers got to watch a re-run which saw the expert accidentally break an item after her team had paid for it. In celebration of the Platinum Jubilee, the episode aired this week and was filmed at Exeter's Westpoint Arena and focused on royal memorabilia. The Red Team from the episode had a couple, Tina and Dennis, who was helped out by Philip Serrell.
