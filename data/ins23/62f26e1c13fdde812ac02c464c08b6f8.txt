Many workers can expect to earn more money working in certain supermarkets, courier positions and for train companies than working for the Queen - despite the monarch having "an endless amount of money".Breakroom's data shows that Royal Mail pays its workers 38 percent more than a royal housekeeping assistant role - which has an advertised pay of £7.97.Amazon, Aldi and the NHS also pay their workers at least 28 percent more than the Palace.Meanwhile, working an eight-hour shift at Aldi will reportedly leave workers £21 better off than if they worked for the 96-year-old monarch.
