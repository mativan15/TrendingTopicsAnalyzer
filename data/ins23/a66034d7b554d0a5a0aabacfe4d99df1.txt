The Los Angeles Lakers are somewhat banged up as they approach their regular season opener on Tuesday.
Lonnie Walker IV has an ankle injury, Dennis Schroder is out with a finger injury, Troy Brown Jr. is dealing with a back ailment and Anthony Davis missed three of the team's six preseason games with lower back tightness.
Then, during the Lakers' final preseason contest on Friday, Russell Westbrook exited in the first quarter with a hamstring ailment.
All these injuries threaten to greatly deplete the very solid backcourt and wing depth they have worked hard to replenish this summer.
