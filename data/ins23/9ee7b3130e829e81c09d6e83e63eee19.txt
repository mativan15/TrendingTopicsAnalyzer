This year's Call The Midwife will bring back characters from previous seasons for an emotional Christmas Special.
The show's star Stephen McGann has revealed that viewers are in for a tear jerker, with beloved old faces returning for a special appearance in the period drama.
‘Starting with the Christmas special, what I can say is that there is a return of some familiar characters from the past, in a very moving way,' said Stephen, who plays Dr Turner.
‘I think it draws on its own history again, but there's a lot of joy at Christmas as usual.
