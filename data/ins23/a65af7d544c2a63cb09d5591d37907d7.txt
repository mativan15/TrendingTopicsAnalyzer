On arrival at Perth airport last week, wicketkeeper Matthew Wade said that his team's heavy loss to England in last year's Twenty20 World Cup group stage was 'the lightbulb moment' that made the Australians change the way they approached the format and go on to win that tournament.A week after Wade spoke in Perth, having endured three more beltings by England in the interim, it is reasonable to wonder whether the lightbulb is flickering.Only rain in the final match could turn whitewash to washout.
