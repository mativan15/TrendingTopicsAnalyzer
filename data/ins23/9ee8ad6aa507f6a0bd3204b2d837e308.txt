Penn State and Minnesota are each coming into Week 8 looking for a rebound. The Nittany Lions were clobbered on the road by Michigan, and Minnesota was unable to create offense against Illinois in a division loss to the Illini. With Penn State set to host the Gophers for a primetime whiteout game, and with a big test coming up the following week, Penn State must take advantage of the home field advantage this week.
According to the early line on the game from BetMGM, Penn State will be a slight favorite at home.
