President Joe Biden's administration released a new biodefense strategy Tuesday that it says will help the nation better protect itself against future pandemics and biological threats.

As a part of the plan, the administration is requesting $88 billion from Congress over the next five years to help fund new research and technology, accelerate testing and shorten the timeline to develop vaccines.

'The United States must be prepared for outbreaks from any source – whether naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberate in origin,' a White House release said.
