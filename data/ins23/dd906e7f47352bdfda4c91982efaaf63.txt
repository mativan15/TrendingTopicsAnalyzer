There's plenty of money to be made in the world of professional wrestling. Even WWE superstars, who aren't among the company's biggest names, earn a salary that's well into six figures.
Wrestlers who are on the 'Monday Night Raw' or 'SmackDown' roster make at least $250,000 per year. On WrestleMania 38 weekend, WWE Executive Vice President Paul 'Triple H' Levesque told The Athletic that WWE superstars earn a minimum of a quarter of $1 million.
By comparison, the minimum salary for MLB players was $570,500 for the 2021 season.
