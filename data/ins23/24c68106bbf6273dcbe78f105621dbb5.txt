On Oct. 16, 1993, there were three games featuring teams that were all 5-0 or better: No. 1 Florida State beat No. 15 Virginia, 40-14; No. 6 Nebraska beat Kansas State, 45-28; and No. 19 Auburn defeated No. 4 Florida, 38-35. It was the first time in college football history that six teams with such records played one another on the same day, according to ESPN's Chris Fallica.
