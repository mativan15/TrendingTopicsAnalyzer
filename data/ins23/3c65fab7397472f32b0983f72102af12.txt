A team hasn't repeated as World Series champions since 1999-2000 seasons. Atlanta won't get the chance to break that streak.

The Braves' season ended Saturday afternoon with a Game 4 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies.

Channel 2 sports director Zach Klein is in Philadelphia. He'll have postgame reaction streaming on Channel 2 Action News at 6 p.m. and WSB Tonight at 11 p.m.

Saturday's game was the first elimination game the Braves played since 2020 NLCS Game 7. The team did not play an elimination game during 2021 World Series run.
