HECTOR, MINN. – Deron Johnson was a teenager when Gophers great Darrell Thompson broke off a 98-yard touchdown run against Michigan in 1987. Johnson spent the rest of the afternoon mimicking that run.

He graduated from the Carlson School of Management in 1995 and has held Gophers football season tickets for 21 years.
