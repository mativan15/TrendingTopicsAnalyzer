Two Coachella men were arrested this week for kidnapping, robbery and extortion of a man in the city last Sunday, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department said Friday.

Deputies first responded to a report of an alleged kidnapping on Sunday at around 11:30 a.m., according to a news release issued Friday.

Deputies determined that a man, who has not been identified, had been at an area casino and then left with two other men. The three men drove to Coachella.

Investigators later identified 34-year-old Alexander Edlund and 26-year-old Brian Jamand as the two suspects the man left with.
