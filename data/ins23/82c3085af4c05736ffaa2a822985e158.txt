The Foreign Secretary has warned restless Tory colleagues against 'defenestrating' another Prime Minister as he suggested a leadership contest would neither win the hearts of the British public nor calm the markets.James Cleverly, a prominent supporter of Liz Truss throughout her campaign for the top job, insisted 'the plan is not to make mistakes' but 'they do happen', after the PM's authority was hammered by a raft of humiliating U-turns to quell the mini-budget turmoil.He said he understands why people are 'frustrated' with the Tory leader, adding that dire polls for the party are obviously 'disconcerting' for the Government.
