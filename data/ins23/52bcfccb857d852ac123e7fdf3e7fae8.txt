One of the early angel investors in the troubled ed-tech firm Invact Metaversity, Gergely Orosz, has raised concerns publicly about the ongoing conflict between the company cofounders Manish Maheshwari and Tanay Pratap. In an email to investors of the company, Orosz said that Maheshwari wants ‘more equity than vested'. Maheshwari, the former Twitter India head, had earlier said he would leave the startup but has gone back on his words, Orosz alleged. 
Pratap was also marked on the email. Both the founders of Invact Metaversity, which began operations in October last year, have had differences of opinion over the vision and execution of the startup and had brought these issues before their investors last month.
