NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet last year said he was committed to axing stamp duty, but Treasurer Matt Kean said financial assistance from the federal government was needed to overhaul stamp duty.LoadingFederal Treasurer Jim Chalmers was contacted for comment as to whether the government would consider providing NSW with this assistance.The proposal would have given home buyers the option of paying a large lump sum upfront, similar to stamp duty, or an annual property tax. Under the proposed change, once a property is subject to the tax, subsequent owners must also pay.
