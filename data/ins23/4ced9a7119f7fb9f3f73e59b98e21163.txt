Amaravati: Retail petroleum dealers have urged the Centre to grant special status to their trade and also extend an interim relief by way of interest-free credit to help overcome the huge capital loss suffered on account of reduction in excise duty. The Consortium of Indian Petroleum Dealers (CIPD) has said the reduction of Central excise duty twice within a span of six months has pushed the retail trade into a tailspin, vastly eroding its capital base and reducing the fuel purchase capacity. In a letter to the Oil Industry Coordinator, the CIPD national president M Narayana Prasad noted that the sudden cut in retail selling price diminished the working capital of the petroleum retail dealers and wiped out their finances as they had to carry the mandatory three-day stock.
