Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said the central government's subsidy Bill for fertilisers will cross an estimated Rs 2 lakh crore this financial year — 25 per cent more than the fertiliser subsidy of the last financial year.
The Prime Minister virtually inaugurated the 'country's first Nano Urea Liquid' plant of IFFCO (Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited) during a 'Sahakar Se Samriddhi' event – a gathering of all cooperative institutions of Gujarat– at Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar.
