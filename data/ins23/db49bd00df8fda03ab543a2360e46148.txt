As the value of recorded music for most artists remains in the ditch and touring continues to lose its luster as a way for musicians to make even the barest semblance of a living, Drake has some advice for up-and-coming musicians: 'keep going.' On Instagram, the rapper shared a post from the Flyer Vault — an archival account dedicated to 'documenting Toronto club and concert history' — that featured an invoice for what was likely Drake's first live performance. The gig took place Aug. 19, 2006, at the now-shuttered venue, Kool Haus, with Drake earning a meager $100 that night as he opened up for Ice Cube.
