Three lovely children (the loveliest in the world, to be more accurate), who came for a short post-coronavirus visit to Israel, were the reason I packed a few things and went up north to visit friends and family, and take a swim in the Sea of Galilee, before the weather turns too hot.

But the three kids, as kids are, needed to be fed, and they are all meat aficionados, so I booked us a table for four at Marinado, the carnivores' haven of the North, and where one can get some of the best grilled meats in the country.
