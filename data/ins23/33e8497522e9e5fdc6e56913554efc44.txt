The UK's armed forces minister, James Heappey, has suggested he would resign if the prime minister did not fulfil her leadership promise to raise defence spending, after the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said no department would be immune from cuts.Hunt said the full reversal of Liz Truss's economic plans meant 'decisions of eye-watering difficulty', and suggested nothing was off the table, including defence and health spending and the pensions triple-lock.Speaking on Tuesday, Heappey said the target had not changed and the government still intended to spend 3% of GDP on defence by 2030.
