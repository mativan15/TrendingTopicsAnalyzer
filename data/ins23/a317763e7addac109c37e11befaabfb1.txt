Government sources say arrangements are underway for Japan's Prime Minister Kishida Fumio and his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese to issue a new joint declaration on security cooperation. The two leaders are scheduled to meet in Australia this weekend. Kishida said during a meeting of executives of his ruling party on Monday that he intends to discuss security, energy and food supplies with Albanese. Government sources say the new security declaration will likely encompass a range of cooperation over the next 10 years.
