The Fed slashed rates to zero in March 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic slammed the US economy causing millions of layoffs.Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said evidence is starting to emerge that Federal Reserve actions are having an impact on the US economy, with some indications of a turn in labor demand and increased stockpiles of unsold items.
'We're seeing a little bit of indications that some firms are no longer reporting the kind of huge labor shortages that they were before,' Summers told Bloomberg Television's 'Wall Street Week' with David Westin.
