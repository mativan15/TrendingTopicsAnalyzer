Big City firms do not see eye-to-eye with this government on everything, to say the least, but there is one issue on which they have been in full agreement: UK pension funds should be putting more money into British start-ups.Ministers love talking about the UK's booming start-up scene and how much money it attracts, particularly from America, the world leader in venture capital. But they bemoan the lack of investment from British pension savers. Quite right, say the City firms. If only the government loosened the rules a bit, pension funds would invest more in start-ups, which would improve the returns for pension savers, turbocharge the economy and ensure that more value stays in the UK.
