Much like China, surveillance cameras are a way of life in public spaces in Britain.

Widely found in schools, community centres and prisons, as well as on public transit, they act as silent deterrents and as tools for authorities looking to prevent or investigate illicit activity from minor theft to acts of terrorism.

London itself is famously one of the most surveilled cities in the world, with 73 closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras for every 1,000 people living in the British capital. Only Taiyuan in Shanxi Province in northern China and Wuxi in Jiangsu Province in eastern China have more cameras per capita, according to an analysis by security researcher Comparitech.
