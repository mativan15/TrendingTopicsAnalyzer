Protesters on Thursday urged Meta Platforms Inc. to call its Silicon Valley-based engineers and other employees back to the office, after Facebook's parent company continued to dismiss service workers with 'mass layoffs' of shuttle-bus drivers.Drivers and their union supporters rallied in front of Meta's META, -1.28% headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., on Thursday, after more than 160 shuttle drivers and their supervisors lost their jobs. The layoffs amount to about a third of the driver workforce at Meta, according to the drivers' union.
