In the Baltic Sea, on a ship named Independence, Lithuania first launched its quest to break away from Russian energy.The floating gas platform allows them to receive liquid natural gas (LNG).
LNG is gas chilled to -160C so it becomes a liquid which is currently being delivered from the US, allowing Lithuania to break the reliance on pipelines from Russia."I feel proud, first of all, that we did it on time, and I, of course, regret a bit that only this region was caring about security of supply and energy independence," says Darius Silenskis, CEO of Klaipedos Nafta which operates the LNG terminal.
