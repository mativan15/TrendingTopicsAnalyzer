After missing the first few days of OTAs, Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Diontae Johnson has arrived at workouts for the second week, per Steelers beat writer Chris Adamski.
Johnson joins the team in the midst of a contract dispute. Coming off of his best season, Johnson enters the final season of his rookie contract and is looking for a contract extension prior to the team's regular-season opener on September 11.
In 2021, Johnson topped 100 receptions and 1,100 receiving yards to lead the team in both categories.
