A guest on BBC News has unintentionally become the hot topic on social media after her job title created quite the caption. 
Claire Connelly, the chief financial officer of Sunderland based bottling company Clearly Drinks, was being interviewed for a segment this week.
The caption simply stated who she was and what she did, but Amy Van Gar clearly had a laugh when she noticed the ‘Clearly Drinks' attached to Claire's name and shared a post online that has now attracted more than 22,000 likes.
‘Well now, that's not a very nice thing to say about someone, BBC News,' she wrote, also sharing a screenshot of Claire on the news.
