The latest round of province-wide standardized testing — conducted last spring after a hiatus during the pandemic — shows students are struggling with math.

The 2021-22 results, released Thursday morning, show that 59 per cent of Grade 3 students are meeting the provincial standard in math, which is the equivalent of an A or B.

For Grade 6 students, just 47 per cent are.

In literacy, 73 per cent of Grade 3 students hit the standard in reading, 65 per cent in writing. For Grade 6 students, 85 per cent met reading expectations, and 84 per cent in writing.
