Chiba – Japan's major tech trade show CEATEC returned to an in-person format on Tuesday for the first time in three years, with firms seizing the chance to directly interact with visitors and show off their latest offerings.
Over the past two years, the event was held solely online due to the pandemic, but this year saw the introduction of a hybrid format. This could be due to a conflict with your ad-blocking or security software. Please add japantimes.co.jp and piano.io to your list of allowed sites.
