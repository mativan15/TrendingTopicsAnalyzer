Teams that win the first two games in a best-of-seven postseason series have history on their side. Those clubs have prevailed in 74 of 88 instances, but all isn't lost for the team facing a 2-0 deficit.
Following their 3-2 loss to the Astros at Minute Maid Park in Game 2 of the American League Championship Series on Thursday night, the Yankees hope to become the 15th team to overcome a 2-0 deficit in order to reach the World Series for the first time since 2009.
The 14 teams that overcame the odds have proved, time and again, that no two-game lead is safe.
