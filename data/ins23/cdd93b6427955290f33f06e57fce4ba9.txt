KYIV, June 2 (Reuters) - Ukraine jacked up its main interest rate to a seven-year-high of 25% from 10% on Thursday, tightening policy for the first time since the Russian invasion to tackle double-digit inflation and protect the hryvnia as some business activity returns.The Feb. 24 invasion has devastated the economy, which could shrink by at least a third this year as the war has forced 40% of businesses to close, destroyed infrastructure, blocked shipping routes and reduced whole towns to rubble.
