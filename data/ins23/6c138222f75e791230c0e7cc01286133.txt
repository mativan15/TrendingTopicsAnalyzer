US car maker Ford India is set to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) this week with both the Gujarat government and to sell its Sanand plant. The MoU may be signed on Monday itself, the Times of India reported on Sunday. With the critical issue of tax incentives and job retention out of the way, the definitive agreement is likely to be inked within 4-8 weeks and Tata Motors may pay about $100-150 million for the plant, say people in the know. The acquisition will help Tata Motors create more capacity to cater to the fast-growing demand for the brand.
