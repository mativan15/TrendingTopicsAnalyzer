British Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has reversed most of an economic package announced by the government just weeks ago, saying the country needed to rebuild investor confidence.
Hunt said on Monday he was scrapping 'almost all' the tax cuts announced last month and signalled public spending cuts were on the way.
Hunt said a planned 1 percentage point cut to the basic rate of income tax that had been due to take effect next year will not happen.
He also scaled back a cap on energy prices designed to help households pay their bills.
