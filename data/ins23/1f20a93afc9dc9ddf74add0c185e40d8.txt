I've been watching the convoy hearings. It's not an easy slog. They don't keep what was once adorably called bankers' hours, and you have to put up with gaggles of lawyers droning at their self-important pace. Yet it's been gripping.

The government says the convoy was extraordinary and required the first-ever declaration of the Emergencies Act.

The main appeal of the act is that it isn't the War Measures Act, a blunt instrument used by Justin Trudeau's dad in 1970 to effectively put the country under military sway because of a serious though limited crisis in Quebec.
