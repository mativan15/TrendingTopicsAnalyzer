Blue Origin's fifth crewed suborbital spaceflight, NS-21, is targeting liftoff from Launch Site One in Van Horn, Texas, on Saturday. The launch window for NS-21 will open at 8 a.m. local time. The new date comes after the flight was delayed on May 20 due to one of the New Shepard rocket's backup systems not meeting the Jeff Bezos-owned aerospace company's performance expectations during final vehicle checkouts.  BOEING'S STARLINER RETURNS FROM SPACE STATION New Shepard carries crew members above the Kármán line, the internationally recognized boundary of space, where they experience several minutes of weightlessness before making their descent back to Earth.
