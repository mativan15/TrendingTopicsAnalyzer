Enlarge / BMW's factory in South Carolina builds its X models—SUVs and crossovers—and now it's going to build electric ones. Domestic lithium-ion battery manufacturing has received quite the shot in the arm in 2022. In May, the Department of Energy announced it will spend $3 billion to increase battery-making here in the US. But perhaps more consequentially, in August the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act now ties an electric vehicle's tax credit to local battery production. As a result automakers have been scrambling to build new battery factories in North America.
