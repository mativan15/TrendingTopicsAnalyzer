Elon Musk, the world's richest man, appears to actually be in favour of a recession and the resulting economic slump.
The 50-year-old billionaire believes the current financial squeeze will hurt ‘foolish' business owners who deserve to go bankrupt.
And he's evidently not a fan of the post-pandemic remote working revolution.
‘[Recession] actually a good thing,' he tweeted last week. 
‘It has been raining money on fools for too long. Some bankruptcies need to happen. 
‘Also, all the Covid stay-at-home stuff has tricked people into thinking that you don't actually need to work hard.
