The Department of Education announced Wednesday that it will cancel an unprecedented amount of student debt for students who attended one for-profit institution.  The department approved $5.8 billion in full loan discharges for 560,000 borrowers who attended a campus owned or operated by Corinthian Colleges. This "is the largest single loan discharge" in the history of the department.Vice President Kamala Harris' investigation into Corinthian, which was conducted during her time as California's attorney general, "played a key role in developing findings against the for-profit college chain," the department said.
