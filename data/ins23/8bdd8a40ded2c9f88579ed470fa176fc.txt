SAN FRANCISCO — Draymond Green often finds he's living on the edge of ejection. Unapologetically so.
The Celtics have taken notice, and they spoke out about it after the Warriors' blowout win in Game 2 on Sunday.
Green was at his peak intensity from first tip, literally — he smothered Al Horford once he took the ball from Marcus Smart, grabbing the rock to force a jump ball. Boston took possession and Smart threw the ball out of bounds for their first of 19 turnovers.
That intensity inspired his teammates and fueled a stunning defensive performance in the Warriors' 107-88 win, but it also raised eyebrows on the Boston bench who thought his actions might've warranted a double-technical foul.
