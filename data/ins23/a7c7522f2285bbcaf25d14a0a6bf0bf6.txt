The funny part — the strange part — is some people don't want to listen to how the Miami Dolphins are losing. They don't want to hear Jaylen Waddle talk softly with a blue towel draped over his head as if to conceal the pain of his fumble with three minutes left Sunday.

'Tried to make a play, the ball came out, they recovered it,' he said after a 24-16 loss to Minnesota. 'Wish I could have that one back.'

These people don't want to hear coach Mike McDaniel remember the Dolphins' second possession Sunday where five penalties erased 65 gained yards and two dropped passes negated another uncounted total.
