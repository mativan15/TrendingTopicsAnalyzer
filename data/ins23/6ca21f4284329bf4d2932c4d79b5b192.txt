Liz Truss has contradicted her new chancellor Jeremy Hunt and announced pensions will rise in line with soaring inflation – after suggestions the pledge would be dumped.

'I have been clear that we are protecting the triple lock on pensions,' the beleaguered prime minister told MPs.

But moments later, Ms Truss refused to make a similar commitment to increase benefits in line with inflation that has topped 10 per cent again.

More Tory MPs have heaped pressure on her to quit as she insisted she was a 'fighter, not a quitter'.
