(RTTNews) - Russia's services sector deteriorated further in May, albeit at a softer pace, as output and new business declined, while inflationary pressures eased, survey data from S&P Global showed Friday. The seasonally adjusted services Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 48.5 in May from 44.5 in April. Any reading below 50 suggests contraction in the sector. The rate of contraction was the slowest in three months. New business decreased for the eighth month in a row, at a slower yet strong pace, apparently hurt by the
squeezed purchasing power among customers following
hikes in selling prices.
