With their closely fought race heading into its final stretch, San Jose mayoral contenders Cindy Chavez and Matt Mahan sparred Wednesday over homelessness and public safety, critical concerns in the Bay Area's largest city as it chooses its first new leader in eight years.
Chavez, a Santa Clara County supervisor and former San Jose vice mayor making a second bid for the top job, told a packed crowd at Rotary Club of San Jose that the city hasn't moved fast enough to increase police staffing that fell during battles over pension costs a decade ago.
