Long term investing works well, but it doesn't always work for each individual stock. It hits us in the gut when we see fellow investors suffer a loss. For example, we sympathize with anyone who was caught holding The Restaurant Group plc (LON:RTN) during the five years that saw its share price drop a whopping 89%. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 64%. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 29% in the last three months.
