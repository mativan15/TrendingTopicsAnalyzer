The allegations of money laundering against Jain are serious, Bhatia said and noted that he had so far got no relief from any court.The BJP on Tuesday demanded the resignation of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and health minister Satyendar Jain, who was arrested by the ED in connection with a money laundering case, alleging that the AAP chief's stand on the issue shows that he not only condones corruption but is also involved in it. BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia also rejected the Aam Aadmi Party's allegation of "political vendetta" and that Jain's arrest was linked to upcoming polls in Himachal Pradesh.
