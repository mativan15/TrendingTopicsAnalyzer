Arsenal are interested in Inter Milan left-back Federico Dimarco but are unwilling to pay the fee the Italian club are demanding, according to reports.
The Gunners want to bolster their options in the full-back position after being left light in the 2021/22 campaign.
Kieran Tierney's injury problems continued to keep him out of action for periods of the season, while Nuno Tavares struggled to perform consistently when asked to deputise.
Thus, The Sun report that Arsenal want to make a move for Dimarco as a backup for Tierney.
