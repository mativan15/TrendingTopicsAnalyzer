Tesla is set to report earnings on Wednesday after the close. Here are the support and resistance zones to know (even for non-traders).

Tesla (TSLA) - Get Tesla Inc. Report has become one of the most followed and controversial stocks in the entire market.

From CEO Elon Musk four years ago hinting at taking the company private, to his actually putting in an offer to buy Twitter (TWTR) - Get Twitter Inc. Report, there's a reason this stock attracts some controversy.

The company is also the most successful electric-vehicle producer in the world and continues to tighten its grip on the market.
