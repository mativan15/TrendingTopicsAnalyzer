This happened to a California woman who found a sofa set on Craigslist for FREE! So she jumped on the offer, but once the furniture was finally in her house she noticed something tucked in the cushion. Turns out it was numerous envelopes filled with $36k cash! The woman contacted the sellers of the couch and returned the money. Turned out the couch belonged to a family member who passed.
