PHILADELPHIA (AP) — There was at least one fuddy-duddy in San Diego who did not see the humor in a mural painted this week of the famous San Diego Chicken using his super-sized yellow foot to stomp on the side of the head of the Phillie Phanatic.

Did someone cry fowl because of the mascot-on-mascot crime?

Or was it just superstition that made the makeover necessary because of a belief it's best not to put the cart before the chicken?

Whatever the reason, the mural outside Tivoli Bar and Grill was quickly gone -- yes, a true cover up because no one has fessed up to applying the fresh coat of paint -- but the original art is a bit of a metaphor for what's happening in the National League Championship Series.
