Analysis The Biden administration's efforts to stymie China's semiconductor industry appear to have got the attention of chipmakers.
This week Bloomberg reported that China's Ministry of Industry and Information called an emergency meeting, inviting some of the country's largest chipmakers to voice their concerns. Many, including Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., reportedly painted the Biden administration's trade bans as extremely harmful to their businesses.
While China may be an economic powerhouse, its domestic semiconductor industry remains years behind those of South Korea, Taiwan, or – for the moment at least – the US.
