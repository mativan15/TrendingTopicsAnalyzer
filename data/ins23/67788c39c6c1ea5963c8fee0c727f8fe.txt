The question pits dentists against insurers.

Voters in Massachusetts are being offered the chance this election to decide if dental insurance companies should spend a certain percentage of their monthly premiums on patient care, similar to rules already set up for medical insurance.

If approved, ballot Question 2 would make Massachusetts the first state to introduce a uniform rule for a 'medical loss ratio' for dental insurance. It would also introduce other new rules for dental insurers in the state, including expanded financial reporting.
