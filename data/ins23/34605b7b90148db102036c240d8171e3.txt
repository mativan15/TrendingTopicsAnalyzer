A 6-month-old cat has gone viral on social media after its owner shared a video of it sucking on a dog's nipples as if it was being breastfed.The clip, shared Wednesday on TikTok by the cat's owner under the username Cacti670, shows the kitten apparently trying to get milk from the family's shih tzu. The dog may be producing milk even though she has never had puppies, the owner wrote.For kittens that are separated from their mom at a very young age, suckling with something, such as a rug, a toy or another pet's nipples, is normal behavior.
