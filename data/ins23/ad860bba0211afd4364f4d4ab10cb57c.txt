A librarian who started making videos of favourite recipes for her grandchildren is now teaching people across South Taranaki to cook. Annitta Johnston-Pulham, 65, is the star of a series of cooking videos posted on the South Taranaki District Libraries facebook page. The Eltham-based librarian now finds herself being recognised in the community by people for her culinary prowess, as well as her book work. Her most popular video to date is for pancakes – which were eagerly taste tested by her camera assistant, 10-year-old granddaughter Ataahua.
