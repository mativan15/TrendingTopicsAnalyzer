Apple Store employees at an Oklahoma City location became the second store in the nation to unionize, according to reports. "We have been helping these workers to unionize through a project that we have called ‘Code CWA,' which supports workers in tech and games," Beth Allen, the Communications Director for Communications Workers of America, told FOX 25.The group calls itself the Penn Square Labor Alliance because the retail location is at Penn Square Mall. The employees made the vote to unionize Friday night.
