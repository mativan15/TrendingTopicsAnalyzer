Grinning at the victorious Tory leadership candidate as Liz Truss learned of her imminent accession to No 10 on 6 September was Hugh O'Leary, her husband, who has largely stayed out of the spotlight before and since.The accountant has his own political story to tell, though his career with the Conservatives took quite a different trajectory to his wife's at an early stage.Born in 1974, Mr O'Leary was reportedly brought up in Allerton, Liverpool, and went on to study at the London School of Economics.
