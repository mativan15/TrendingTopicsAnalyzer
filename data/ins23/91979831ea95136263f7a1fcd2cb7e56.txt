Lost Frequencies One of the leading exponents of lilting 'tropical house' hails from a place well north of the equator. Electronic composer, producer and DJ Lost Frequencies (a.k.a. Felix De Laet) is Belgian, but his music often has a laid-back Latin or Caribbean vibe. And while his beats and riffs derive from electronic dance music, De Laet is best known for enlisting guest vocalists to collaborate on mainstream synth-pop hits such as 'Where Are You Now' (sung by Calum Scott) and the recent 'Questions' (sung by James Arthur).
