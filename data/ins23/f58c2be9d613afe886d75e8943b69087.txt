Fine Gael will seek major new interventions in the property market later this year, with the party eyeing an increase in income thresholds for social housing eligibility amid ongoing criticism of the Government's record on housing.Sources in the party this week spoke of increasing nervousness over the housing crisis, with one saying failure to address it before the next election would 'shred the centre ground of Irish politics'.Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys this week told colleagues in the party that a hike in the income limit for social housing eligibility – something that is determined by her Fianna Fáil Cabinet colleague Darragh O'Brien – should be on the table.
