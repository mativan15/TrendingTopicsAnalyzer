The 27-year-old goalie, whose brother Mike played for the Oilers from 2000-03, relished playing in goal in his hometown. "It was great, but it´s just two points and it doesn´t matter who we´re playing against and what´s going on whether my family is in town," Comrie said. "I´m just going out there with this group of guys and giving it all I have for this group, no matter where it is or when it is.
