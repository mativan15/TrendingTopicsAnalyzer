The special master reviewing Mar-a-Lago docs again criticized Trump's arguments Tuesday.

Judge Raymond Dearie accused Trump's lawyers of making contradictory claims.

Trump pushed for Dearie to be appointed, but it's a decision that visibly backfired.

Former President Donald Trump pushed hard to have a so-called "special master" appointed in his legal fight over the documents seized by the FBI from Mar-a-Lago.
