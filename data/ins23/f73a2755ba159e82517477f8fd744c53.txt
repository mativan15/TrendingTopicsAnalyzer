No. 9 Texas baseball could not ask for a better start to the NCAA Tournament. The Longhorns took down Paul Skenes and Air Force 11-3, saving relief pitcher Tristan Stevens in the process.
Texas was able to force the Falcons to the bullpen in the fifth inning by taking excellent at-bats and working deep into many counts. Skyler Messinger had a huge day at the plate, going 4-5 with three RBI. The third baseman broke the game open with a bases loaded RBI single in the fifth.
