The bye week has come at a great time for Auburn Football.
The Tigers have dropped three straight games, and have played close games with all but one opponent. A much-needed break will allow the players to relax, get healthy, and mentally prepare for the final five games of the season.

History suggests that a bye week usually means good things for Auburn. Looking back at the last ten seasons, Auburn has played 13 games following a week off (Auburn had two bye weeks in 2013, 2014, and 2019), winning 11 of those games.
