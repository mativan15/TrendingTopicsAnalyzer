Thousands of Victorians trying to start or grow their families will be able to access free IVF services from today.

The Royal Women's Hospital and Monash Health are now running Australia's first public IVF clinic in Melbourne.

Once it is fully operational, the service will be open to up to 4,000 people per year and will deliver expected savings of up to $10,000.

'IVF can be a game changer for people who might be struggling to have a child, but too often and for too many, it's financially out of reach,' Premier Daniel Andrews said.
