Sex Pistols legend Glen Matlock has admitted he's pleased to be out of the country and on tour at the moment because the ‘terrible, turgid Tories have just been getting on top of me.'
The 65-year-old rose to fame as the bassist and songwriter of the Sex Pistols alongside lead singer John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten), guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook.
The punk group released their anti-authoritarian hit God Save The Queen in 1977 to mark the silver jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, and while it was banned by the BBC at the time, it has since been reissued to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee.
