City hall may soon clamp down on short-term rentals offered on websites like airbnb and Vrbo, based on concern about nuisance complaints and the housing crisis. On Tuesday, city council's Community and Protective Services (CAPS) Committee considered a staff recommendation to create a new category of business license for short-term accommodations (STAs) operating in London. Short-term rentals would only be permitted on the host's primary residential property — closing the door on out-of-town operators and multi-unit businesses.
