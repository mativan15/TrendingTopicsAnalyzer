SACRAMENTO (CBS SF) -- Alan Hansen was sentenced Tuesday to eight years in prison and ordered to pay $619,415,950  in restitution for participating in a billion-dollar Ponzi scheme involving DC Solar. Tuesday's sentencing came after the 51-year-old Vacaville man pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and aiding and abetting money laundering. Between 2011 and 2018, DC Solar manufactured mobile solar generator units that the company claimed were being used to provide emergency power to cellphone towers and lighting at sporting and other events.
