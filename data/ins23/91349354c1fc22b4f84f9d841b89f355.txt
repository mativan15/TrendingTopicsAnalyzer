Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday ordered Germany's three remaining nuclear plants to remain in operation until April to fend off a possible energy crunch. There has been disagreement in the governing coalition over the lifespan of nuclear power plants. However, Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck of the Green Party on Monday said he accepted the fact that Scholz had overridden others in the Cabinet. The chancellor has asked the Economy, Environment and Finance Ministries to create the legal basis for the plants to remain open.
