I would love to say we don't have any exposure, but we did have one stock and that has cost us money. We have one residual investment in Sberbank, which has a very low value. If you look at a big, liquid, deep market that has come down a long way and has lagged other emerging markets it is China. The reasons for that are pretty well-known and obvious. That seems to us to be a logical first place to look. There are a lot more concerns about interest rates in comparison to six months ago. This has caused investors to adjust their 'discount rates', which determine the present value of a company's future cash flows.
