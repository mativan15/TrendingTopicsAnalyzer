Many car parks have adopted parking apps that allow drivers to conveniently pay for their parking on their smartphones. However, in some cases, this is now the only way to pay. And, without the option to pay with cash, many elderly motorists without the ability to use the apps risk receiving hefty fines.The measures have now sparked a national debate on whether older drivers should be forced to use parking apps, or if they should have the option to use cash instead in order to avoid the fines.Ryan Fulthorpe, motoring expert at GoCompare, has claimed that elderly drivers should not be penalised for their inability to use the apps.
