President Joe Biden announced Monday that the application for people seeking student loan debt relief is officially available online.

The form, which Biden said takes less than five minutes to fill out, requires individuals to submit their date of birth, Social Security number and contact information. No other documents are required to be uploaded.

'It's easy, simple and fast. And it's a new day for millions of Americans all across our nation,' Biden said.

The application will be open through Dec.
