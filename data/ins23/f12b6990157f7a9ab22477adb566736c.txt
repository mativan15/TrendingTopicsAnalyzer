NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Blackstone Inc, the world's largest alternative asset manager, said on Thursday its third-quarter distributable earnings fell 16% year-on-year, owing to a sharp drop in asset sales amid a downturn in the market.

Financial markets have been rocked by geopolitical unrest from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and rising interest rates by central banks, which have hindered private equity firms like Blackstone from cashing out their investments for top dollar.
