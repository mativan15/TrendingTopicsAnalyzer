Retail workers at Apple's Cumberland Mall store in Atlanta have withdrawn their request to hold a union election this week. In April, the employees filed a petition for a union election with the National Labor Relations Board after over 70% of the location's more than 100 eligible employees signed union authorization cards. The group, which includes Apple salespeople, technicians, creatives and operations specialists, were seeking representation from the Communications Workers of America.Ticker Security Last Change Change % AAPL APPLE INC.
