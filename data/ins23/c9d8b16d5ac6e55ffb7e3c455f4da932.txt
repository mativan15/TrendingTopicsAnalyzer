LIZ Truss is hanging by a thread tonight after a Cabinet Minister was sacked and confusion reigned about whether a second had quit. 
Suella Braverman was fired as Home Secretary for sharing official documents with a colleague from a private email. 
In a parting shot she launched a stinging attack on the embattled PM by airing serious concerns of "the direction the government". 
And this evening Tory MPs claimed Chief Whip Wendy Morton sensationally resigned amid chaotic scenes during a crunch Commons vote - but Minister Steve Baker has told The Sun she remains in post.
