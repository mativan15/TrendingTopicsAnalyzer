The federal government is temporarily lifting the work limit for international students next month, something that Ottawa students affected by the policy say is long overdue.On Nov. 15, the federal government will remove the 20-hour-per-week limit on off-campus work while classes are in session. The pilot project, in effect until the end of 2023, is an effort to address Canada's labour shortages. "This is good news for a lot of students," said Landry Wamba, president of the University of Ottawa's International Students Association and an international student from Cameroon in his fourth year at the university.
