'Ticket to Paradise,' a romantic comedy that reunites long-time friends and co-stars Julia Roberts and George Clooney, could defy box office odds. Admittedly, it seems strange to suggest a movie with megawatt talent like Roberts and Clooney could be anything other than a massive triumph. But even in pre-pandemic times, romantic comedies were challenged at the box office. It's been especially stark in the COVID era; although 'The Lost City' with Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum beat expectations with $190 million globally, Billy Eichner's 'Bros' has faced an uphill battle to reach $10.
