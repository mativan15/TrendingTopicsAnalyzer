Come back to work... Plea to over 50s (Image: GETTY)Jane Gratton, Head of People Policy at British Chambers of Commerce, said last night: 'Businesses rely on the skills and experience that older workers bring to the workplace. But hundreds of thousands of people have left the workforce during the pandemic so we are seeing a worsening of skills shortages and mounting problems for employers.'She suggested more training opportunities, and support for workers who become ill, would encourage older people back to work.
