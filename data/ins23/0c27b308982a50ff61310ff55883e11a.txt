It's a season of change in the Big Ten.

Indiana is the preseason choice to win the championship after finishing ninth last season.

Wisconsin is picked ninth after sharing the title with Illinois.

Purdue will enter the season outside the Associated Press Top 25 after appearing in six of the previous seven preseason polls. Michigan State is out for the second straight year after having appeared in 21 of the previous 23 preseason polls.

Conference upheaval was predictable with the departures of 17 of the top 25 scorers, including three top-10 NBA draft picks.
