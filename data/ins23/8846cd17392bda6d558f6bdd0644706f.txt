Tafadzwa Ufumeli/Getty Images News Initiating its coverage on COVID shot maker Ocugen (NASDAQ:OCGN), Cantor Fitzgerald argued on Thursday that even a small share of the U.S. COVID-19 vaccine market could lead to meaningful sales for the clinical-stage biotech. Ocugen (OCGN) has partnered with Bharat Biotech to introduce an inactivated-form of COVID-19 vaccine candidate named BBV152 to the U.S. market. The vaccine is already authorized in India under the brand name Covaxin. While the U.S. market for COVID-19 vaccine is dominated by larger more established players, 'we believe there is still a substantial opportunity for new entrants, as the market moves towards what may become an annual vaccination model,' Cantor analyst Jennifer Kim wrote.
