The New York Jets have gone from 3-point underdogs to 1-point favorites at the Denver Broncos on Sunday.

The Jets are getting 75% of bets and 71% of the money at BetMGM as they're now the favorites at a Broncos team that dropped to 2-4 after an overtime loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on Monday. New York moved to 4-2 with a win at the Green Bay Packers on Sunday.

The total for the game has also dropped significantly, perhaps both the line move and the total move are a reaction to the hamstring injury that Russell Wilson is reportedly dealing with.
