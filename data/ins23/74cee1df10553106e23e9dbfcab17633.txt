Inflation in the US is a consequence of mistakes by American financial authorities, which they admitted to, while in the EU it has more to do with short-sighted energy policies in Brussels, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday. Either way, it has nothing to do with Moscow or its actions in Ukraine, he added.Attempts to blame the turmoil in Ukraine for the skyrocketing cost of living in the West amount to dodging responsibility, Putin said in a TV interview that followed his meeting with the African Union head Macky Sall in Sochi.
