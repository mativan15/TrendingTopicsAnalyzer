San Francisco has announced plans to spend nearly four times the cost of a typical US home to construct a single water closetSan Francisco's local government expects to spend up to $1.7 million to build just one public toilet - hardly a drop in the bucket for a city that gets thousands of complaints annually of feces on its sidewalks - and the project will take an estimated three years to complete.City leaders were scheduled to gather on Wednesday afternoon at Noe Valley Town Square to tout their success in obtaining state funding for the pricey toilet, according to a public notice for the event.
