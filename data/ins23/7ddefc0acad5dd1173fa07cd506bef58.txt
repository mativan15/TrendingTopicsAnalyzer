Randy Boyagoda is a novelist and professor of English at the University of Toronto. His latest novel, Dante's Indiana, has yet to become a television series.Whether on campus or at the dog park or at a dinner party, after a little pandemic chit-chat, the topic inevitably turns to television. The conversation doesn't feel as tired or tiresome as it can with the pandemic, but it's getting there. The question is no longer, did you see X last night? Instead, it's, have you seen X or Y or Z?And the answer is, reliably, no, I haven't seen the new version of Interview with the Vampire, or the latest Star Wars origins story, Andor, or the just-dropped third season of Ramy, but, I counter, have you seen The Bear (amazing), or We Are Lady Parts (amazing), or the latest season of Atlanta (amazingly uneven)? And the answer is, again, reliably, no.
