June 02, 2022 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--YuJa, Inc. announces a new engagement with Messiah University in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. The institution was seeking an enterprise media solution that provided lecture capture, media management and a variety of tools to facilitate online and hybrid programs.



The university is transitioning from Ensemble Video, which is sunsetting its product this fall. Because instructors have content stored with the previous vendor, the ability to migrate content and metadata from that content was important to administrators.
