The BJP should ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi to undergo a lie detector test and say the CBI and the ED are neutral agencies and have nothing to do with his party, the AAP said on Tuesday. The reaction of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came after BJP leader Kapil Mishra dared Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia to subject himself to a lie detector test over his claim that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) tried to put pressure on him to quit his party and join the saffron outfit. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader also said Sisodia's allegation was a "shameless" attempt to "influence" the agency's probe into the alleged Delhi excise policy scam.
