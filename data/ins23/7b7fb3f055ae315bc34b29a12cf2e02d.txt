The Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commision (CySEC) has granted the Binance Class 3 registration as a Crypto Asset Services Provider (CASP), according to a blog post from Binance.

Following in the footsteps of rival crypto exchange FTX, which set up a Cypriot entity in March, Binance is now permitted to offer spot, custodian, staking and card services in compliance with CySEC's anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing.

Binance also has similar registrations in France, Spain and Italy.
