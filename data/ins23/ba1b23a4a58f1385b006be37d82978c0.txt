AUVERE, Estonia, Oct 19 (Reuters) - When Baltic states switched off Russian power and halted other imports in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Estonia restarted its shale oil power plants and set back its efforts to phase out heavily polluting fuels.It mirrors actions across the European Union as governments wean themselves off Russian gas, which once supplied the bloc with about 40% of its needs, and race to find other gas suppliers or alternative fuels as a stopgap for winter."It is an insurance ticket for Estonia because the oil shale is there," said Hando Sutter, chief executive of Estonian state-run energy group Eesti Energia.
