The Tennessee Titans and Nashville mayor John Cooper have reportedly struck a deal on a new domed stadium after months of negotiations.

According to Axois Nashville's Nate Rau, Mayor Cooper and the Titans will hold a press conference at 2 p.m. CT on Monday to make the announcement, which will also include the financing plans for the new venue.

Based on earlier reports, the new stadium will be located to the east of Nissan Stadium and will be the focal point of the East Bank redevelopment plan. Expectations are that the new stadium will cost around $2.
