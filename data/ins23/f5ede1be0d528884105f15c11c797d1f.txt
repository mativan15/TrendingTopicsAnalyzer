On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Thursday, Colson Baker, aka Machine Gun Kelly, promoted his new movie Good Mourning.

He also revealed the biggest waste of money from his small budget film.

'We spent $50,000 between this lobster and an electric eel,' MGK said. '‘Cause we were super meticulous. We needed his claws to move. We needed its mouth to move. We gave it abs!"

MGK explained how part of the whopping amount also went to the puppeteers who operated the lobster and eel during their 15 minute scene.
