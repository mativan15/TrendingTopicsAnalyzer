One of the best gaming laptop deals we've seen in recent weeks is this 15.6-inch Acer Nitro 5 at Walmart for $729 (was $999) (opens in new tab) - a listing that features an absolutely fantastic price for a machine with an RTX 3060 graphics card.This mid-range GPU is usually the feature on gaming laptops within the $900 to $1,200 range, so seeing a machine for under $800 with such a powerful component is a real scoop.As you'd expect, the other specs aren't quite as high-end in this machine, but the combination of an AMD Ryzen 5-5600H processor, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD is easily enough to get great performance on most games at 1080p.
