The New England Patriots already had Mac Jones' understudy on the roster when they drafted Bailey Zappe in the fourth round of the 2022 NFL Draft. It took one week for Zappe to steal Brian Hoyer's job. Now, after three games, two starts and, more importantly, two wins the rookie is becoming a viable threat to return to the starting lineup.
But only if a healthy Jones struggles late this fall.
Zappe's hot start continued in Week 6 as his Patriots roasted the Cleveland Browns 38-15 on the road. The rookie, operating from a deeper playbook than the conservative passing offense he'd captained in a 29-0 win over the Detroit Lions seven days earlier, carved up a middling Browns' passing defense en route to 309 yards and a pair of touchdowns.
