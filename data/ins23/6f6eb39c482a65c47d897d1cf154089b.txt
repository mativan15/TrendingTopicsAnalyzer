Oil edged higher on Friday, supported by expectations that OPEC's decision to increase production targets by slightly more than planned won't much affect tight global supply and by rising demand as China eases COVID restrictions.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, on Thursday agreed to boost output by 648,000 barrels per day (bpd) a month in July and August rather than 432,000 bpd as previously agreed.Brent crude rose 15 cents, or 0.1%, to $117.76 a barrel by 1338 GMT.
