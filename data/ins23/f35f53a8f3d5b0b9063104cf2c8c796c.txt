BRASILIA (Reuters) - Leftist presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva assured Brazil's Evangelical Christians that he would not restrict religious freedoms if he is elected on Oct. 2, and praised the dedication to their beliefs.

In a public letter to Brazilian Evangelicals, Lula said he was personally opposed to legalizing abortion and his government would leave that issue for Congress to decide.

Lula said his message, coming less than two weeks from a second-round runoff against far-right incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro, was prompted by campaign lies spread by his rival that warn voters that a Lula government would close churches and curtail religious freedoms.
