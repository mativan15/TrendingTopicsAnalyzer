stockinasia Investment Thesis I currently rate Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) as a buy since the company has a broad economic moat and, at the same time, it has strong growth drivers that will contribute to the company's success in the upcoming years. I expect that Walt Disney's broad and diversified product portfolio, strong brand image and growing streaming service Disney+ will contribute to the company's growth in the coming years. In my opinion, Walt Disney is an excellent buy and hold investment. The reason for that is that I consider Walt Disney to be an excellent choice in terms of risk and reward.
