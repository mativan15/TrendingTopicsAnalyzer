I love tablets, even more than I love phones. The best tablets are inviting and friendly, with huge pictures and big swiping gestures. The best phones are fragile and culpable – you put a case on it because you know you're going to break something. With phones, every year I trade in my phone and buy the newest, coolest version. For more than a decade that's been a Samsung Galaxy or an Apple iPhone. I go back and forth, because each offers benefits over the other, and they are both fun. With tablets, I bought an Apple iPad, because it's the only tablet worth buying.
