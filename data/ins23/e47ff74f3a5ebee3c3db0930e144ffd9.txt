lovelyday12 Silvergate Capital (NYSE:SI) shares slumped 9.6% in Tuesday premarket trading after the digital asset-focused bank's Q3 earnings disappointed as the use of its real-time payments network declined during the quarter and its cost of deposits increased. Q3 GAAP EPS of $1.28, trailing the average analyst estimate of $1.41, increased from $1.13 in Q2 and from $0.68 in the year-ago quarter. Silvergate Exchange Network, which enables U.S. dollar transfers between participating Silvergate account holders, handled $112.
