Someone tried to bully a girl at school but she had the perfect comeback.

TikToker @dying.for.you has pink hair and a punk rock aesthetic. In 2020, it's a style that's existed for decades. But for some reason, it was a problem for one of her peers. The bully secretly took a selfie with her in the background with the caption, 'Didn't know it was Halloween yet.'

In a viral TikTok, @dying.for.you showed a picture of the photo and added her response at the end. She turned the bully's captioned pic into a cool T-shirt that showed just how above it all and unbothered she really was.
