Collider.com After four years and three seasons, the beloved Derry Girls series has come to an inevitable and bittersweet end. Following the story of a group of friends growing up in Derry, Northern Ireland during The Troubles, Derry Girls blends the reality of teenage growing pains against the backdrop of war. For Erin Quinn (Saoirse-Monica Jackson), Orla McCool (Louisa Harland), Clare Devlin (Nicola Coughlan), Michelle Mallon (Jamie-Lee O'Donnell), and her cousin James Maguire (Dylan Llewellyn), the politics of their city are just another part of daily life as they come to terms with growing up and finding their place in an ever-changing world.
