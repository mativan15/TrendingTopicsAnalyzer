Ever since Lenovo acquired IBM's x86 server business in 2014, one thing has proven elusive: profit.
Now the company can point to a pair of consecutive quarters, and a full year, in the black.
The Chinese kit-maker yesterday reported Q4 and FY 2022 results, with quarterly revenue of $16.7 billion representing seven percent year on year growth. Annual revenue reached $71.6 billion, an increase of 18 percent. Annual net income topped $2 billion. The Infrastructure Solutions Group fell over the line for an annual profit of $6.
