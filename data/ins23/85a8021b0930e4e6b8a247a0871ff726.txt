NFL legend Tom Brady is unfortunately proving his former boss Bill Belichick wrong after the New England Patriots head coach claimed the quarterback could play until he was 50. Brady's play at 44 years old during the 2021 season suggested he could continue performing at the highest level for the foreseeable future - and maybe even surpass 50. He led the NFL in passing yards with a career-high of 5,316 while also tossing 43 touchdowns as he accumulated a passer rating of 102.1. However, the 45-year-old has struggled in 2022.
