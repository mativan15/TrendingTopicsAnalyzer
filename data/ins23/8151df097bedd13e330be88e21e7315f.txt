West Ham United are plotting a move for 'promising' Real Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin this summer.

What's the story?

As reported in the Sunday Mirror (via Claret and Hugh), West Ham are expected to open talks with Real Madrid this week over a loan move for Andriy Lunin. Any deal could also include the option to buy the player.

The goalkeeping situation at The London Stadium is still undecided with Lukasz Fabianski the only one staying at the club at the moment.
