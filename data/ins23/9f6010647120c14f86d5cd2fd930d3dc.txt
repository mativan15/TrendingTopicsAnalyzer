Seeking more money and winning, Al Horford left the Celtics in 2019. He signed a four-year contract with the 76ers that'd be worth $97 million-$109 million. The range hinged on whether he made the NBA Finals, won a championship.

Back with Boston, Horford is headed to the NBA Finals for the first time in his career.

As a result, an extra $5 million of his salary for next season has become guaranteed.

Horford never fit with Philadelphia as hoped. He got traded to the Thunder, who gave him practically no chance of playoff success.
