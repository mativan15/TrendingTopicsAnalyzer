The Seattle Seahawks (3-3) visit SoFi Stadium to take on the Los Angeles Chargers (4-2) Sunday at 4:25 p.m. ET (FOX). Below, we look at Seahawks vs. Chargers odds from Tipico Sportsbook; check back for all our NFL picks and predictions.
The Seahawks are coming off a 19-9 NFC West win against the Arizona Cardinals Sunday. QB Geno Smith again played at an MVP level, which is helped by the presence of wide receivers DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett. While RB Rashaad Penny provided the run game early in the season, rookie Kenneth Walker III will be relied on now that Penny is out for the season with a broken leg.
