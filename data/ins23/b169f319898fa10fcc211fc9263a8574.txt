If you were to poll hockey fans about who would win the Art Ross Trophy this season, the vast majority would say Connor McDavid. The same could be said in regards to the Hart Trophy, though McDavid finished behind Auston Matthews for that honour last year.

Speaking of Matthews, the majority of hockey fans would also vote in favour of him winning the Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy this season, something he has done in each of the two past campaigns.
