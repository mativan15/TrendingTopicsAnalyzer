Kader Khan is remembered for playing the jovial comic roles in many of David Dhawan's films in the 1990s but the late actor was a popular dialogue writer in the 1970s who wrote for some of the most popular films of the era. Directors Manmohan Desai and Prakash Mehra would frequently collaborate with Kader Khan for their many Amitabh Bachchan starrers – Amar Akbar Anthony, Muqaddar Ka Sikander, Namak Halal, Coolie – and at one point, Khan was even paid Rs 1,21,000 for his work, which was considered extraordinary at the time.
