Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi founder and Chidambaram MP, Thol. Thirumavalavan, on Friday demanded that the State Government must provide permanent jobs to guest lecturers working in government colleges in Tamil Nadu. Mr. Thirumavalavan made the demand based on an appeal made by Tamil Nadu Government College Guest Lecturers Welfare Association who said that guest lecturers take home ten times less salary than permanent lecturers despite the fact that they have played a crucial role in development of students studying in government colleges in Tamil Nadu.
