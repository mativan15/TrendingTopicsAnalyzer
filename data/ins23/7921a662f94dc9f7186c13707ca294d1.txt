PHILADELPHIA -- The Braves didn't face an elimination game last year on their path to winning the World Series.
The Phillies have not played a potential postseason series clincher at home since Game 5 of the 2011 National League Division Series against the Cardinals.
That all changes Saturday afternoon, when Atlanta and Philadelphia meet at Citizens Bank Park for Game 4 of the NLDS with the Phils leading the best-of-five series, 2-1.
'Even if we would have lost today, I would have had microphones in front of my face, and I would say that tomorrow is a must-win game,' Phillies right fielder Nick Castellanos said after their 9-1 win in Game 3 on Friday.
