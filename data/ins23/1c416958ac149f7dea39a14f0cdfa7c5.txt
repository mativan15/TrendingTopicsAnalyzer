Unaccompanied children seeking asylum have been living in hotels alongside adults whose backgrounds have not been checked, a damning report has revealed.An independent inspection has severely criticised the Home Office after staff in two hotels had not been checked by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS), as required by government rules. Staff had access to master keys while young refugees stayed in the building.The findings come as official figures show that in the year to September, 3,256 children were held in hotels.
