A Manhattan jury found Kevin Spacey not liable for battery in a sexual assault lawsuit filed by fellow actor Anthony Rapp. Rapp sued Spacey in 2020, saying the then-26-year-old star sexually assaulted him at a party at Spacey's New York City apartment in 1986 when Rapp was just 14. Rapp, who played Mark Cohen in the Broadway show "Rent," first made the allegation in a 2017 article published in BuzzFeed News during the height of the Me Too movement. He alleged that Spacey lifted him onto a bed, grazed his buttocks, and then got on top of him — with Spacey's groin pushed up against his hip — before Rapp wriggled away and fled the apartment.
