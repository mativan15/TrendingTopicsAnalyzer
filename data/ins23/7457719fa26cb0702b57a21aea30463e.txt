Haas team owner Gene Haas admits that Mick Schumacher has 'wrecked a lot of cars and cost us a lot of money' with the German's future still up in the air. Scuhumacher, son of seven-time F1 world champion Michael, is battling to keep his seat with his contract expiring at the end of the season and Nico Hulkenberg reportedly rivaling his spot to partner Kevin Magnussen in 2023. Schumacher did not score any points last season but secured his first top-10 finish at Silverstone in July - he is currently 16th in the Drivers Standings on 12 points, 10 behind his team-mate Magnussen.
