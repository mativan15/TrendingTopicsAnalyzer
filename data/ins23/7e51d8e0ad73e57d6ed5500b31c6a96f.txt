With an annuity, people hand over a lump sum and then are provided with a regular guaranteed income in retirement. However, previous low interest rates meant people parted with a lot of money and saw little in return.Recent rises in interest rates have caused bond yields to rise and this has led to an increase in the rates offered on annuities.New figures out this week showed that annuity rates have leapt by 44 percent in the space of a year and are now at their highest levels since early 2009.It means someone aged 65 with a £100,000 pension pot could now get an annuity income of £7,191 a year – up from £4,989 in October last year, according to the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown.
