Medline's Optifoam Gentle EX is designed to help displace pressure when used with pressure injury prevention protocol. The product features five unique layers to help absorb shear force and friction and manage moisture:


Silicone layer minimizes trauma to the wound with gentle adhesion.
Absorbent layer super-absorbs and retains exudate.
Transfer layer helps move fluid and moisture away from the skin and helps prevent leakage.
Foam layer absorbs exudate to minimize pooling at the wound's surface.
