The coach retired after 21 seasons with the Wildcats following the team's Final Four run in the 2022 NCAA tournament.

After serving for 21 seasons as the head coach of the Villanova men's basketball team, Jay Wright retired in April. But, Wright didn't stay away from the college basketball world for long.

Although Wright denied interest in returning to coaching back in June, the New York Post reported on Thursday that the 60-year-old is planning to join CBS and Turner Sports for their broadcast coverage of the Final Four this upcoming season.
