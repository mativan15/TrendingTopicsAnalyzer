Massimo Giachetti/iStock Editorial via Getty Images AMC Entertainment stock (NYSE:AMC) rose steadily throughout a robust stock-market day to finish up 18% - its biggest gain in two months, on volume nearly 80% higher than normal. One reason for investor optimism may be a new box-office jolt after a few weeks of (relative) slowdown in theaters; new Tom Cruise action film Top Gun: Maverick is opening on a record number of screens (4,732 in all) and is expected by many to bring some $100 million in receipts by the time people return to work on Tuesday.
