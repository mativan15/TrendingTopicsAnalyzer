Britain's Got Talent judge Simon Cowell quickly reassured finalists Flintz and T4ylor after rapper Flintz forgot many of his words during a powerful performance. 
The duo only met earlier this year, but they stormed through to tonight's finale, where they were up against 10 other incredible acts.
Along with Amanda Holden, David Walliams and Alesha Dixon, Simon was on hand to provide feedback from the panel after each performance.
But rapper Flintz and pianist Taylor needed a bit more reassurance than the rest after the emotions got the better of one half of the duo.
