By Australian Associated Press Published: 10:10 EDT, 28 May 2022 | Updated: 10:10 EDT, 28 May 2022 Aleksandar Prijovic joined Western United determined to make an impact in big games. After all, he has played at a World Cup and in the Champions League. In Saturday night's A-League Men grand final, Prijovic scored one goal, had an influence on Nuno Reis' opening own goal and was excellent throughout the 2-0 win over Melbourne City, claiming the Joe Marston Medal. "That (performing in finals) definitely was a target of mine when I came here and I'm happy that I could fulfil it, that I could deliver in the right moment," he told Network 10.
