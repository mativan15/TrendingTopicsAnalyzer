Liz Truss has resigned as the British prime minister, but more importantly, she has been bested by a 60 pence (about 68 cents) head of lettuce in a countdown of who would last longer.

The stunt was the work of the British tabloid paper the Daily Star, which started a livestream on YouTube on Oct. 14 with the title, "Will Liz Truss still be Prime Minister within the 10-day shelf-life of a lettuce?"

Well, today the answer was a resounding no, as Truss appeared in front of Downing Street to formally announce that she would be resigning, just 44 days after being elected to office — less time than Kim Kardashian's failed marriage to Kris Humphries.
