In front of dozens of friends and family, Jabari Smith Jr. had a strong NBA debut with the Houston Rockets Wednesday on the road against the Atlanta Hawks.
Smith, who grew up just outside of Atlanta, earned the start and produced 17 points, seven rebounds and one assist in the 117-107 loss. He finished by shooting 6-of-17 from the field, including 3-of-11 from 3-point range, in nearly 33 minutes of work.
His 17 points were the fourth-most by a Rockets rookie in a debut.
The third pick looked to play aggressively throughout the contest and was decisive with the ball on offense.
