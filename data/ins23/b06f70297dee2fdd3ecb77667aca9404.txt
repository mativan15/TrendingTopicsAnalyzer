New Rochelle, N.Y.: Once again, the bell tolls for innocent children and adults and we can only pray and mourn such tragic losses. A young man, his identity unimportant in terms of his race or color, obtained weapons of considerable destruction, allegedly severely wounded his grandmother and then took the lives of 19 children and two adults in a school district near San Antonio.What in God's holy name drives such desperation?

This follows a recent tragedy in Buffalo, where 10 good citizens and warm souls perished at the hand of another young man.
