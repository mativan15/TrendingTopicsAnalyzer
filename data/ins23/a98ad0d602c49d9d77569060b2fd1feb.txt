After the successful relaunch of its flagship television market MIPCOM, which wraps up Thursday, events organizer RX France on Wednesday unveiled details for its reboot of sister market MIPTV, which runs April 17-19. The spring market will be shifting its focus to put non-scripted and documentary programming at its heart. 'Documentary and factual programming will take center stage at MIPTV,' said RX France's Lucy Smith. 'We've heard the message from the industry and in response to their needs and their demands we really thought we thought that documentary programming needs to be at the heart [of the market], that MIPTV been the annual international platform for documentary and factual programming launches.
