SOUTHERN PINES — It's Moving Day at the 2022 U.S. Women's Open.

Justin Ray, the head of content for Twenty First Group, highlighted several key stats from Friday's second round. Minjee Lee and Mina Harigae carry the 36-hole lead into the weekend at 9-under par.

In the first three U.S. Women's Opens at Pine Needles, the fields combined for 43 scores in the 60s through the first two rounds. Entering Saturday, that number already is at 42.

Some tougher pin locations and firmer greens should normalize play this weekend.
