Sarina Wiegman hailed England's 'exciting' 2023 Women's World Cup group after they were drawn alongside Denmark, China and either Senegal, Haiti or Chile.

The European champions' first Group D match in Australia and New Zealand will be against the winner of an intercontinental play-off, with Chile waiting to play the victor from a clash between Senegal or Haiti to claim a place in the group.

The Lionesses' matches will take place in Brisbane, Sydney and Adelaide and the head coach is already considering the different playing styles from the nations.
