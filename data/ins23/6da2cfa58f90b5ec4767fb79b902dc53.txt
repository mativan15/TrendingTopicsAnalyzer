Average 30- and 15-year mortgage rates continued to drop, falling to levels we haven't seen since early April.
 
The average rate offered for a conventional 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 5.45% from 5.52% the previous business day, while the average 15-year rate declined to 4.45% from 4.55% the previous business day. Last month both reached their highest points since at least 2019, and likely much farther back: 6.19% and 5.26%, respectively. Now they're the lowest they've been since early April, before those peaks.
