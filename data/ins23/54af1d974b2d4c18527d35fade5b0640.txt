Published: 18:39 EDT, 3 June 2022 | Updated: 18:40 EDT, 3 June 2022 New York Rep. Rep. Chris Jacobs announced that he won't seek reelection to his suburban Buffalo seat just days after crossing powerful interests and party leaders by voicing support for gun control measures in the wake of a mass shooting. Jacobs, first elected in a special election in June 2020, came out for an assault weapons ban following the mass shooting that killed 10 people at the Tops supermarket in Buffalo. He told reporters he has decided to retire instead of facing what he said would be 'an incredibly divisive election,' just days after voicing support for for a ban, similar to one that was enacted in 1994 but expired.
