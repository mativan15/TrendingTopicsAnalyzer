Ontario government officials say they are doing more to protect new home buyers by doubling the maximum fines for unethical builders and vendors of new homes who unfairly cancel a new home project or terminate a purchase agreement. Minister of Public and Business Service Delivery Kaleed Rasheed and Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Steve Clark were in Windsor on Thursday for the announcement. Proposed changes under the New Home Construction Licensing Act (NHCLA), would, if passed, increase existing maximum financial penalties from $25,000 to $50,000 per infraction, with no limit to additional monetary benefit penalties.
