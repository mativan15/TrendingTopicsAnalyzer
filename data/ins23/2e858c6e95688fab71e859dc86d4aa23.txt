The IOC had warned last month that should the issue not be resolved by Oct. 15 the country's national Olympic Committee would be banned. "No solution could be found between the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of Guatemala and the relevant authorities in Guatemala within the prescribed deadlines," the IOC said in a statement.
