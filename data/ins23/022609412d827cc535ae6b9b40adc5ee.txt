The Toyota GR86 is the designated race car of the newly formed single-make racing series.

The series (called the GR Cup) was formed by Toyota Gazoo Racing North America and features homologated GR86 Cup cars.

The GR Cup's first season includes 14 events, with track locations and GR86 Cup car pricing coming this summer.

It's no secret that the Toyota GR86 is one helluva sports car, and now it's set to become the star of a newly formed single-make racing series. Known as the GR Cup, the nationwide competition was announced earlier this year by Gazoo Racing North America (Toyota's motorsport division), with the 2023 season said to be sanctioned by SRO America.
