For nearly 30 years, George Yorks drove his wife Miriam from their Framingham home to every Celtics game at Boston Garden. It wasn't that she had season tickets or anything. 'In fact, I wasn't even a sports fan,' allowing for 'maybe a closet wrestling fan.'So what's with the basketball thing?Well you see, Miriam had a job to do at Celtics games, and it wasn't exactly ushering fans to their seats or selling popcorn. In fact, the game couldn't start until Yorks settled into the very best seat in the house, mid-court, inches from the famed parquet floor; so close to the action she could practically grab hold of Larry Bird's jersey as he sped by.
