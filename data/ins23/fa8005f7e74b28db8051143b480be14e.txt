If you're lucky enough to live in a place where nature puts on a show in autumn, maybe your nose knows it's fall as soon as you step outside. 
'That's what fall is all about. Leaves are falling off the trees and the bacteria and fungi that are in the soil are actively digesting [them,]' said Theresa Crimmins, director of the USA National Phenology Network. 'And in the process, various [gases] are being released, and that's a lot of what the smells are.' 
Then again, if fall is in full swing and yet your local foliage isn't popping, the hold up could be connected to the warming climate.
