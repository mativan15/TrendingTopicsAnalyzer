Spurred on by Assemblywoman Luz Rivas, D-Arleta, and her efforts to pass a statewide resolution celebrating the history and culture of cruising, the motion also asks the sheriff and CHP to develop multilingual education and outreach strategies to connect with local communities with cruising scenes.
