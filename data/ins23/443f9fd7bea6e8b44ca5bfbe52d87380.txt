The LA Clippers are officially launching their very own streaming service. It's a move that will change the way fans watch basketball and likely have a ripple effect on the rest of the NBA. This venture, known as ClipperVision, is the very first direct-to-consumer streaming platform in the NBA.

ClipperVision will stream more than 70 games live in-market directly to fans without a pay TV subscription, with the first stream beginning on October 22.
