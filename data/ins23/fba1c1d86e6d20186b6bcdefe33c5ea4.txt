Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren on Sunday indicated that the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), his party, and the Congress, its ally, had buried their differences over a Rajya Sabha seat up for grabs from the eastern state in an election scheduled for June 10.
Soren said he held an 'extensive' discussion with Congress president Sonia Gandhi here the evening before on a number of political issues. The meeting lasted more than an hour.
'There is a consensus that the coalition will have one candidate for the Rajya Sabha seat,' said Soren, who has been under the Enforcement Directorate (ED) scanner for a number of alleged irregularities.
