Governor Hochul Announces Launch of 43North's Eighth Startup Competition 
 Governor Kathy Hochul today announced that applications are now being accepted for the eighth year of 43North, the state-funded accelerator that invests $5 million annually to attract world-class entrepreneurs to grow their businesses in Buffalo. This year, 43North is changing its terms by offering companies the chance to receive an even larger individual award than in previous years. 43North will select five seed-stage startups to receive an investment of $1 million each.
