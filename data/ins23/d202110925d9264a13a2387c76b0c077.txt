The Washington Commanders have made an addition to their quarterback room.

Washington signed Jake Fromm to its practice squad on Tuesday, the team announced. Defensive tackle Donovan Jeter was released from the practice squad in a corresponding move.

The move comes just one day after starting quarterback Carson Wentz underwent surgery on his right ring finger in Los Angeles.
