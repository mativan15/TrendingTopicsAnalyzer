Andy Cohen said he was genuinely surprised by Jenn Shah pleading guilty to one count of wire fraud at BravoCon on Friday. Shah was arrested during the filming of season two episode one of "The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City." She told her castmates and viewers that she had not knowingly committed any crimes in subsequent episodes. "I am innocent. I did not do any of the things that have been alleged against me," Shah said through tears in episode 14 of the second season. The US Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York charged Shah was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud in relation to telemarketing and conspiracy to commit money laundering by the Justice Department in March 2021.
