Erik Källgren will get his first start in net with the Maple Leafs tonight against the Arizona Coyotes.

Källgren — who played 14 games for the Leafs last year — was called up when Matt Murray tweaked his groin during the morning skate on Saturday.

Ilya Samsonov won his second in a row that night, and will largely carry the netminding duties until Murray gets back, but coach Sheldon Keefe said he wanted to make sure Källgren gets some playing time.

'We're going to need him,' Keefe said of Källgren.
