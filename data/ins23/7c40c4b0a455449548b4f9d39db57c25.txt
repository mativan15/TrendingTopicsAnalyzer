DoorDash Inc. shares fell as much as 9% Wednesday morning, after the company closed the acquisition of a European food-delivery service and executives updated their guidance to forecast a sequential sales decline for its new property. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made public Wednesday, DoorDash DASH, -5.12% executives updated their second-quarter forecast to include Wolt, which the company acquired for more than $8 billion in stock. DoorDash increased its second-quarter forecast for gross-order volume — which reflects the total amount or delivery orders on its platform — as a result of Wolt's inclusion, but guided for volume on Wolt's platform to decline from the first quarter.
