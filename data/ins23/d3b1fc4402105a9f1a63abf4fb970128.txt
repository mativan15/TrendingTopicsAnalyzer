Germany's former Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing criticism after she defended her previous energy policies, insisting that she had has no regrets about the course her Government took with Russia. Since the invasion of Ukraine in February, Germany's heavy dependence on Moscow for energy exports has been exploited by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been squeezing natural gas flows in retaliation to sanctions. Last year, 55 percent of Germany's gas imports came from Russia, partly the result of Mrs Merkel backing the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline - even after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.
