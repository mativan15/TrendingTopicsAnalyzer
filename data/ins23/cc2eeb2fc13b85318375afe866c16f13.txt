There are two schools of thought in crypto: to regulate or not to regulate. Firstly I'd like to state something that I consider key. It is the idea that computing plus a basic human or technological activity is what drives huge value. Computer + calculation = Excel. Computer + writing = word processing. Computer + gossiping = social media, and so on. Crypto is especially powerful because it can be seen as, crypto = computing + politics. Money, governance, exchange, property, it's all under a gamut core to politics.
