Spencer Platt/Getty Images News Reporting that a stock declined in the last few months is not really newsworthy, as almost every stock declined in 2022. However, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) declined 35% year-to-date and clearly underperformed the S&P 500 (SPY). And not only did the stock underperform the broader market this year, 3M Company is constantly declining since 2018 (for almost 5 years now). Data by YCharts When looking at the stock performance since the early 1970s, the current decline is the biggest drawdown for 3M Company during these 50 years.
