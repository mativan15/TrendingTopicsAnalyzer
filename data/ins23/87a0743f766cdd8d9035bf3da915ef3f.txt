WASHINGTON — 
The Syrian government and Palestinian militant group Hamas publicly resumed ties this week after a decade of estrangement, a move experts believe could have significant regional implications.
A high-ranking Hamas-led Palestinian delegation met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad Wednesday in Damascus, the first such visit in 10 years.
Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, had severed its ties with the Syrian government in 2012 in response to the latter's crackdown on anti-government protests at the beginning of the country's conflict.
