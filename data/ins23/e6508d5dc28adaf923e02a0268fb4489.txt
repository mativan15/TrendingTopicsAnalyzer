By Australian Associated Press Published: 07:40 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 07:40 EDT, 18 October 2022 Wellington Phoenix playmaker Yan Sasse has successfully downgraded his A-League Men suspension from three games to two. The Brazilian received a three-match suspension from the match review panel last week for committing "serious foul play" in Wellington's season opener against Adelaide United on October 9. Sasse spent just 25 minutes on the pitch - the quickest dismissal of any debutant in Australian national league history - before seeing red for what was deemed a reckless lunge on Adelaide's Javi Lopez.
