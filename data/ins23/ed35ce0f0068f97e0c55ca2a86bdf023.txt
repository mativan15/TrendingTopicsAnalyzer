Close

00:00Love to hear how your strategy is evolving in a post pandemic world. You obviously have this thriving online business. You had to close one hundred and twenty stores during the pandemic, but now you've opened almost 200. How do you find the balance of how many and how much? I think the key is to have an multi-channel approach and to constantly meet customers where they want to be met. And we know that customers are shopping as they live physically and digitally. And thankfully, because we're direct to consumer, because we have the direct relationships with our customers, we're able to get feedback and hear from them.
