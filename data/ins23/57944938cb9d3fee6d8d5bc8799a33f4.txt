By Reuters Published: 05:58 EDT, 3 June 2022 | Updated: 05:58 EDT, 3 June 2022 June 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell on Friday, after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he had a "super bad feeling" about the economy, fueling fresh worries that aggressive policy tightening by the Federal Reserve could tip the economy into a recession. Tesla Inc shares fell 3.4% in premarket trading after Musk said he wants to cut about 10% of jobs at the electric-car maker, and warned about the economy in an email to executives seen by Reuters.
