Chris Evert appreciates that she, Serena Williams and other Wimbledon women's singles champions will now be listed on the All England Club's honour boards in a Centre Court hallway simply by their first initial and last name -- the way the men's title winners always have been -- instead of preceded by "Miss" or "Mrs." Evert won three of her 18 career Grand Slam singles trophies at Wimbledon; until now, the entry for her 1981 championship has shown her name as "Mrs. J.M. Lloyd," in reference to her husband at that time, John Lloyd.
