PTIDelhi Chief Minister Arvind KejriwalThe killing of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala is unfortunate but there should be no politics around it, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday. Moose Wala was shot dead by unidentified assailants in Punjab's Mansa district on Sunday, a day after the state government pruned his security cover.

"I believe whatever incidents have happened in Punjab, there should be no politics around them. Sidhu Moose Wala was killed, it is really unfortunate. "Punjab CM has already said they are trying their best and assured that the accused will be soon arrested and given strictest punishment," Kejriwal said on sidelines of his visit to an STP in Delhi's Rohini area.
