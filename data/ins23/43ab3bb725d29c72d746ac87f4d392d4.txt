Stores in Paris must switch off outdoor lighting at night from December GEOFFROY VAN DER HASSELT AFP/File Paris (AFP) – Paris climate activists have found a new way to get across their message against energy waste in the City of Light -- switching off store signs and advertising screens that are kept on all night even though the government has urged people to cut back electricity use. At 9:00 pm on a recent evening, around 20 Extinction Rebellion members gathered for a tactical briefing before spreading out on another night-time raid.
