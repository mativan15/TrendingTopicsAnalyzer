MondayAlmost 100 potential slavery victims were referred to Devon and Cornwall Police in the last year, figures show, as the Home Office reveals plans to restrict claims to stop alleged "abuse" of the system.Figures show there has been a rise in the number of referrals for support across the UK, and anti-slavery charities are now calling on the Government to stop "distracting attention from the real criminals" ahead of Anti-Slavery Day on Tuesday, October 18.It comes after Home Secretary Suella Braverman received criticism for attributing the increase in modern slavery victims to migrants "gaming the system" by claiming asylum in the UK as victims of slavery, and reclassifying the crime as an "illegal immigration and asylum" issue, rather than a safeguarding one.
