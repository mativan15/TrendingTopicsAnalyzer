No one can blame Shane Pinto for having some fun these days. The Ottawa Senators centre's third goal in as many games proved to be the winner in a 5-2 win over the Washington Capitals Thursday night. Pinto's goal was the third of five unanswered goals after the Senators were down 2-0 after the first period. He was held to just five games last season due to a shoulder injury, but is more than making up for lost time with a strong start to the season. During his many months of rehab last season, Pinto admitted he pictured himself being able to make a difference.
