By Australian Associated Press Published: 19:56 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 19:56 EDT, 20 October 2022 A bill to add the Adelaide parklands to South Australia's heritage list has passed the upper house in state parliament, more than a decade after a national heritage listing. The Greens bill passed on Thursday night with the support of the Liberal opposition. It now goes before the lower house where the Labor government has the numbers. Greens MP Robert Simms said Labor voted against the listing in the upper house despite supporting the move before the last state election in March.
