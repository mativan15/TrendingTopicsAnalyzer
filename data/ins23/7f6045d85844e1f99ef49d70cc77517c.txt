Through the 17-game season of 2021 and the early part of this offseason, it's hard to find a quarterback that has been more harshly criticized than Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.
Last year, he was constantly on the receiving end of questions regarding former Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson taking his job. During that time, he wasn't playing up to the standard that you'd expect from a fifth-overall pick.
A few weeks back the team's social media account released a video of a pass from Tagovailoa to new Dolphins wideout Tyreek Hill that was just a bit underthrown.
