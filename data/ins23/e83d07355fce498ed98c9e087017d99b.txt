Just Stop Oil says on its website that 'most of our funding for recruitment, training, capacity building, and education' comes from the CEF and is to date believe to have received $1.1m.
After its activists threw soup at Van Gough's Sunflowers last week it received praise from  Margaret Klein Salamon, CEF's executive director, who warned that 'more protests are coming'.
Phoebe Plummer and Anna Holland were arrested and charged with criminal damage to the frame of the £76million painting, which was protected by a thin piece of glass.
