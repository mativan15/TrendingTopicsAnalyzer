Emma King and her partner Aaron Hams had already moved their wedding forward so Emma's dying father Peter could live to see them wed.
But when Peter's condition deteriorated even further, it became clear that they were going to have to speed up the timeline by 72 hours.
Emma, 38, of Ramsgate, Kent, said: ‘I just knew I wanted my dad to be there, so we decided to bring the wedding forward.
‘Doctors told me at noon on Friday that he didn't have long left, and by the time I'd spoken to the chaplain it was 2pm, and after that, it was just go, go, go.
