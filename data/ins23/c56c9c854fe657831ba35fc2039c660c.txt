Ben Dunster/iStock via Getty Images I last addressed Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in 11/2021's "Alphabet: Simple As ABC, Best Stock Ever, Buy On Upcoming Headwinds" ("Simple As ABC"). The underlying premise of Simple As ABC appeared at the article's outset, Alphabet: ...is one of the top stocks ever with a bright future, and ... headwinds out of Washington and elsewhere will be your ticket to a better price over the next few quarters. At the time it was trading at just under $3,000. The headwinds turned out to be a bit gustier than I had imagined.
