The moves triggered a crisis in parts of the pensions industry, setting off a fire sale of long-dated bonds which forced the Bank of England to intervene to calm the situation.

It can be difficult to work out how much the premium was caused by pensions and how much was driven by traders' view that 'muppets' were in charge of the public purse.
Markets have taken reassurance from the Bank of England's insistence that funds have built significant buffers against another squeeze, but yields are not completely back to normal.
