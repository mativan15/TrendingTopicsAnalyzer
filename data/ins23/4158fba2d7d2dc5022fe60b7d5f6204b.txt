Chelsea hope to sign Jules Kounde in a deal similar to the one they thought would land the defender last summer.
The west Londoners offered £42 million for Kounde 12 months ago and believed they had clinched an agreement only for Sevilla to move the goalposts and insist the £67m clause in his contract was paid in full.
But now Chelsea are hopeful that another bid in the region of £42m with the possibility of add-ons to take the total value of the deal up to £50m will be enough to land Kounde.
Kounde is understood to remain keen on a move to Stamford Bridge after being left frustrated by the collapse of the transfer last year.
