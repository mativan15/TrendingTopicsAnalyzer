Sundry Photography/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) lost ~8% most intraday since June 2021 on Wednesday to reach a 52-week low as Wall Street attributed the company's better-than-expected Q3 2022 financials to COVID-19 testing revenue. Citing a ~5% drop in sales, the company said that the declines in COVID-19 testing-related sales and a pause in production of certain baby formula in its Sturgis, Michigan, facility led to the underperformance. However, the company's COVID-19 testing sales exceeded Street forecasts, while the Nutrition segment, which houses baby formula products, reported worse-than-expected sales.
