Oct. 20—Five years after David's Chair founder Steve Furst inadvertently launched a nonprofit to provide access to the outdoors for those facing mobility challenges, the organization is growing by leaps and bounds, moving into a more "official" space and expanding its reach to make specialized wheelchairs accessible around the country.

A handful of events that start tonight and run into the weekend will raise money to fund special outdoor track and golfing chairs that allow mobility-challenged folks to enjoy such things as beach trips, fishing, hunting and golf.
