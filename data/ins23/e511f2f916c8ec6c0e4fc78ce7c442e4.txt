A Virginia man has been acquitted of murder after using what amounted to a gay/trans 'panic' defense, outlawed in the state just a month after the victim's death.

A jury Friday found former Virginia Tech football player Isimemen Etute, 19, not guilty of second-degree murder in the beating death of Jerry Paul Smith, The Roanoke Times reports. The trial took place over three days in Montgomery County Circuit Court in Christiansburg, Va.

Smith, 40, had had a sexual encounter with Etute in Smith's apartment in Blacksburg, Va.
