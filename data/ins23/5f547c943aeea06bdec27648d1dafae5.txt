The Green Bay Packers lost to the New York Jets on Sunday, their season going nowhere fast behind a sputtering offense.

GREEN BAY, Wis. – Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has sung the praises of Allen Lazard, Sammy Watkins and Randall Cobb. He's raved about the potential of rookies Romeo Doubs and Christian Watson.

Rodgers has also talked frequently about his improved relationship with general manager Brian Gutekunst.

Through six games, though, the Packers' new receiver corps hasn't been good enough to offset the offseason trade of Davante Adams.
