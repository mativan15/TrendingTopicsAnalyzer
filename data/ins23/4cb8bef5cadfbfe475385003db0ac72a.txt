Parenting - like investing - is a percentage game. If you get it right more often than you don't, then you are probably doing OK. 
And as with investing, you have to take the rough with the smooth. One moment it's "I wish David Beckham was my dad", the next it's, "I'd never have bought this flat if it hadn't been for you and our Isa pact."
Ah, yes, the Isa pact. One piece of parenting I really can be proud of. 
Nudge psychology at its best, and proof positive that with the right incentives there really is such a thing as a free lunch.
