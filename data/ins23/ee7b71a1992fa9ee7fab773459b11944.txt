DUBLIN, Ohio — Jack Nicklaus says he met with a Saudi Arabian group as a courtesy and had "zero interest" in running a rival golf circuit now being led by Greg Norman. "I don't care what kind of money they would have thrown at me. My allegiance has been to the PGA Tour," Nicklaus said Tuesday at his annual news conference ahead of the Memorial. "I grew up on the PGA Tour. I helped found the PGA Tour as it is today. My allegiance is there and it's going to stay there." Nicklaus was unusually brief, with three questions related to the Saudi-funded LIV Golf Invitational series that is set to start next week outside of London and has an eight-tournament schedule, five of them in the United States.
