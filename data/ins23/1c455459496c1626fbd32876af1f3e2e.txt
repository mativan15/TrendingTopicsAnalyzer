Montreal has carved a spot for itself as a global leader in video game development, now it is faced with a new challenge — a labour shortage.
The city houses industry leaders including Ubisoft, Warner Bros. Games and boutique studios like Behaviour Interactive, establishing itself as a notable force in the video game sector over nearly three decades.There are 14,000 workers in video game development, at more than 280 different studios in Quebec — contributing $1.4 billion to Quebec's economy annually, says Emilien Roscanu, director of communications for industry association La Guilde du jeu video du Quebec, a non-profit organization that connects participants in the sector, including developers and entrepreneurs.
