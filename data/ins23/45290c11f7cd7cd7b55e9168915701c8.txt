Rarely is there good news to write about in the Middle East. The same seems to be true of foreign policy more generally. So when something good happens, and American mediation produced it, we should call attention to it.

The US-brokered agreement establishing the maritime boundary between Israel and Lebanon is such an achievement.

Having been an American mediator in the Middle East, I know why it is so difficult to produce understandings or agreements between warring parties. Lebanon and Israel remain in a state of war, but this agreement now reduces the risk of conflict and creates a mutual stake in both countries being able to extract natural gas.
