Utilities are warning of potentially serious power outages this summer in many parts of the country. This crisis isn't the result of an unforeseeable surge in electricity use; it's because of misbegotten policies. For years governments have been mandating that utilities use more and more renewable sources of energy—primarily from windmills and solar panels—to generate power instead of fossil fuels and nuclear plants. Many coal- and gas-fired power facilities are being closed. A number of nuclear power plants have been or are in the process of being decommissioned, and replacements are lagging.
