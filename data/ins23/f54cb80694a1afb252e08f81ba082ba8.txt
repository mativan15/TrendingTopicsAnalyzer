elena_larina Investment Thesis The share prices for Genco Shipping (NYSE:GNK) and other dry-bulk marine shippers are volatile and the dramatic changes in the Baltic Dry index show why. I think GNK's stock price will appreciate based on developments in Dry Bulk shipping supply and demand plus marine fuel costs. Even if GNK's stock price only moves from $14.18 to $15 by May 19th, a 44.5% potential annualized return is possible including covered call premium and dividends. Genco Shipping Genco Shipping is a provider of international seaborne dry-bulk transportation services.
