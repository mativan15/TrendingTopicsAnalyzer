AgenciesCongress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram said the Government seems "helpless against the relentless decline" in the value of the Rupee. He said the declining Rupee has consequences for inflation, current account deficit and interest rates.The Congress on Thursday hit out at the Narendra Modi government over the "continuous fall" of the Indian Rupee and accused it of always being in electioneering mode and having no focus on economic issues. Noting that mere statements will not work, the party also suggested that Prime Minister Modi convenes an immediate meeting with experts to take remedial measures in this matter.
