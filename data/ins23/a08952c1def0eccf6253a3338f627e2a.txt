In a promotional video for its Tech World 2022 event, Lenovo showed off a laptop with what appears to be a rollable screen. In a brief working demo, you can see the screen of what appears to be an old-school notebook slowly begin to rise from the keyboard deck, unfurling into a display that is monstrously, disconcertingly tall. My initial impression is that this thing looks a bit... tall. It's not clear from the video whether I could stop the screen anywhere I wanted in the progression or whether I'd need to fully unroll it every time.
