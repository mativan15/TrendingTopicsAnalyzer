By Will Feuer Shares of Canoo Inc. rose more than 12% in premarket trading after the company said it has received a binding order from van-rental-provider Kingbee for 9,300 American-made electric vehicles. Kingbee has an option to increase its order to 18,600 vehicles, the companies said. Kingbee would upfit, wrap and deliver the Canoo vehicles as work-ready fleets solutions for small-and-medium sized business customers across the U.S., they said. "This order is yet another key milestone as we allocate production capacity for the coming years," Canoo Chief Executive Tony Aquila said.
