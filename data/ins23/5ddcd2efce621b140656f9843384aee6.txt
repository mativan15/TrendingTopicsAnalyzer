Published: 14:14 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 14:14 EDT, 20 October 2022 First-year Georgia coach Mike White knows he's facing the difficult task of helping his new team learn how to win. The players White inherited enjoyed far too little winning last season. Georgia set a school record with 26 losses last season, including the final 12. The Bulldogs finished 6-26 overall and 1-17 in Southeastern Conference games. The one SEC win set another new low for the program, and Tom Crean was fired one day after the season before White was hired from SEC rival Florida.
