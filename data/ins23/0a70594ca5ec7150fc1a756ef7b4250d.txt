It's my way, not the highway.Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca says only he can stop Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford's controversial Highway 413.'Could I make this any more clear? I'm the guy who stopped it the first time and I'll stop it again,' Del Duca told reporters Friday in Mississauga.Taking aim at the cornerstone promise of Ford's re-election campaign — the proposed 60-km freeway between Milton and Vaughan — the Liberal leader said it is a $10-billion road to nowhere.'Highway 413 is a waste of money and an environmental disaster in the making — I know, I was the transportation minister who killed it the first time,' said Del Duca, who served in the cabinet of premier Kathleen Wynne.
