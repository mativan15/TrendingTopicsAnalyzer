NEW YORK, June 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) is suspending financial guidance for the full year 2022. Macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated since S&P Global Inc. ("the Company") last provided financial guidance on May 3, 2022, negatively impacting the Company's expectations for GDP growth and debt issuance volumes. Given the volatility and uncertainty in the issuance environment, the Company cannot affirm its previously issued guidance and expects to reintroduce formal financial guidance in conjunction with its second quarter 2022 earnings results.
