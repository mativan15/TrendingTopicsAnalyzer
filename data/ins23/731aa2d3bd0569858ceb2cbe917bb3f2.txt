Japan's government plans to quickly draft bills that would provide relief to people who say they were financially exploited by the former Unification Church. The religious organization is under scrutiny over its allegedly shady marketing practices and for soliciting large donations from its members. Prime Minister Kishida Fumio told the Diet on Tuesday that his government plans to submit bills to the ongoing Diet session to revise the relevant laws as soon as they are ready. A study group of officials from the Consumer Affairs Agency, the Justice Ministry and other relevant offices was launched on Tuesday.
