It might be of some concern to shareholders to see the ModivCare Inc. (NASDAQ:MODV) share price down 18% in the last month. While that's not great, the returns over five years have been decent. After all, the stock has performed better than the market (48%) in that time, and is up 58%. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 47% decline over the last twelve months.

In light of the stock dropping 7.7% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return.
