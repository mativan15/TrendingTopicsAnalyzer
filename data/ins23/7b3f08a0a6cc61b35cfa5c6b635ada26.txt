Children attending eight Maui Economic Opportunity Head Start preschool sites are enjoying new play structures after completion of a $506, 000 renovation project.

The open-air play structures have a lower profile and provide for better safety and supervision of children compared to the old tower structures, some of which were put up as far back as 2005, according to an MEO news release.
