UNC football quarterback Drake Maye is off to a hot start in his first year as a starter for the Tar Heels. The redshirt freshman has the Tar Heels off to a 6-1 overall start and a 3-0 start in the Atlantic Coast Conference.
And with his latest performance against Duke on Saturday, he joined some very elite company.

Maye became just the second quarterback in the ACC in the past 25 years to have three-straight games of 300 passing yards and 50 rushing yards. That streak has only been matched by one other quarterback and it's a pretty elite name — former Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson.
