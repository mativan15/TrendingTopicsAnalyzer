"I ran a fake news website for four years and I made good money out of it," a young Bulgarian man tells DW. He explains how and why he made people fall for fake news online.


"If I can't convince them they are wrong, I might as well make some money out of them," says Dimitar (not his real name). It was this thought that set Dimitar on the road to becoming an administrator of what he calls a "fake news website" in Bulgaria. The people the young man is talking about are the people who fall for disinformation online, and making money out of them turned out to be easier than he ever imagined.
