Social media firms must make it easier to report misogyny, says Ofcom's chief, after its study found 60 per cent of women have suffered harmful behaviour online including harassment and trolling in just a month.
In an interview with The Telegraph, Dame Melanie Dawes, the watchdog's chief executive, said the 'shocking' abuse that women faced online was getting worse while at the same time they had lost confidence in the ability of social media firms to remove it when they complained.
'People don't feel that when they report something that there'll be any action,' said Dame Melanie, who pledged that Ofcom would be 'straight into the companies and asking for information' once it was formally empowered as the regulator by the Government's new online safety laws.
