Public inquiries are costing the taxpayer more than £110 million a year with a third of the money going to lawyers.There are 15 live public inquiries, including those into the Grenfell Tower fire, the Manchester Arena bombing, the infected blood scandal and undercover policing — which have cost in excess of £634 million since the longest running was set up in 2014.Analysis of their accounts suggests £200 million of public money has been spent in legal fees but the true figure will be significantly higher because some inquiries do not provide a cost breakdown and public bodies such as police forces and local councils must meet their own legal bills.
