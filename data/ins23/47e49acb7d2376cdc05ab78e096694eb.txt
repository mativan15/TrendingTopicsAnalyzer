Oct. 20—TRAVERSE CITY — It's a family thing for Ayden Totten.

The Traverse City West senior follows a long lineage of playing in the Traverse City Patriot Game, along with his adopted brothers and Titan teammates.

His uncles Shane and Nate played in the Traverse City Central-Traverse City West rivalry. His father Adam participated before it was even called the TC Patriot Game in 2001. The Totten name dots the record book kept for the Central-West rivalry.

"It's cool looking back and just seeing how I've had family, especially my dad, play here," Ayden Totten said.
