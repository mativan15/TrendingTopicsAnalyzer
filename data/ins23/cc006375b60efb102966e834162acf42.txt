PRAGUE, May 31, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- This is a project that is unprecedented in the world. Two days after the Russian invasion, the Ukrainian Embassy in Prague set up a special account for donations to buy military equipment for the Ukrainian army.
"I am incredibly proud of the solidarity of Czech citizens and companies with Ukraine, which is facing a brutal and criminal attack by Putin's Russia. 120,000 donors and the 40 million euro raised send a clear message about where the Czech Republic stands," says Czech Defence Minister Jana Černochová.
