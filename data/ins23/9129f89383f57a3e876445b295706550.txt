ATHENS — When Joe Burrow and his family moved to Athens, Ohio, in 2005, the self-confident, outgoing second-grader was always friends with everyone.

His parents, Robin and Jimmy Burrow, recalled how their son, who grew up in southeast Ohio after Jimmy took a job as a defensive coordinator for Ohio University's football, was acutely aware that kids came from different backgrounds.

But no matter whether someone was different because of their race and ethnicity or socioeconomic status, Joe saw everyone as equals, his mother told The Dispatch recently.
