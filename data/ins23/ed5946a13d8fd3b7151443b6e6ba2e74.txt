Tim Ryan, the US chair of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said the firm's hiring plans aren't going through "any major shocks or changes right now" and that the accounting firm is moving ahead with plans to fill thousands of open positions in areas such as auditing and consulting."Right now we haven't seen any reason to make any major adjustments at all," Ryan told Insider.
