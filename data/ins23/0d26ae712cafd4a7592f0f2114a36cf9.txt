The English RFU and Premiership Rugby have been ordered to appear before a UK parliamentary inquiry after Wasps followed Worcester Warriors into administration, leading to 167 people at the club being made redundant, including all the coaching staff and players. That includes former All Blacks head coach John Mitchell, who is the club's attack coach, and New Zealand-born flanker Brad Shields, who played 100 games for the Hurricanes and won nine caps for England. Wasps, who have won the Premiership six times and twice been crowned champions of Europe, will now be relegated by the RFU and are set to be suspended for the rest of this season.
