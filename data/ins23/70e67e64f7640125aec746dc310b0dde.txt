Liverpool are waiting to learn the extent of Diogo Jota's injury with Jurgen Klopp pessimistic over the latest injury blow to hit his side.
Jota went down deep into added time and was stretchered off the pitch as the Reds sealed a vital 1-0 victory over Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday evening.
The Portugal international missed the first six games of the season through injury with his latest knock coming a week after Luis Diaz suffered a knee problem that is expected to rule him out or six to eight weeks.
