By Australian Associated Press Published: 22:05 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 22:05 EDT, 17 October 2022 A pledge to end native logging in Western Australia's southwest is included in a draft Forest Management Plan released for comment by the state government. The move will preserve another 400,000 hectares of forest on top of the 1.6 million hectares already protected. Under the 10-year plan, the only timber to be taken from native forests will come from managed activities designed to improve forest health, such as ecological thinning, or for clearing for approved mining operations, and infrastructure maintenance.
