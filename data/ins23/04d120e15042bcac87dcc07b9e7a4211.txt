Citigroup has downgraded its price target on sports betting company DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) from $35 to $28.
Shares are down -4.69% in today's trading, and have dropped -59.45% in the last six months and -71.72% in 12 months.
Analysts have remained bullish on DraftKings after management said earlier in May it remains confident in hitting near-term EBITDA targets and reaching profitability without more capital raises.
Jefferies was bullish on the stock ahead of investor meetings with the company and Morgan Stanley has DKNG slotted as a top pick for the legal US sports betting & iGaming market.
