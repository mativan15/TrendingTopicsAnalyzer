Hotels owned by Donald Trump and his family repeatedly overcharged the Secret Secret Service for their rooms, billing up to $1,185 per night, according to documents obtained by a House committee.

The findings by the House Oversight and Reform Committee run counter to claims by Trump's family that use of the properties would save the government money and show that the Secret Service spent at least $1.4 million at Trump properties after he took office.

'The exorbitant rates charged to the Secret Service and agents' frequent stays at Trump-owned properties raise significant concerns about the former President's self-dealing and may have resulted in a taxpayer-funded windfall for former President Trump's struggling businesses,' committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-New York, said in a letter to Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle.
