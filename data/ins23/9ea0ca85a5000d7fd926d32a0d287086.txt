Meta's complex relationship with India's citizens and government is again in the spotlight after allegations it rolled out the red carpet for government censors.
The allegations appeared in Indian outlet The Wire last week, in reporting that asserted that posts reported by Amit Malviya, president of the IT team at India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was given access to the XCheck program that allows high-profile users to circumvent normal content rules.
XCheck is also thought to confer privileges, including removing posts on Meta's social networks.
