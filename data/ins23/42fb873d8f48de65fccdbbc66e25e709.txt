A group of Auckland students who believe kids don't learn enough about financial literacy at school have taken matters into their own hands. Ormiston College students Saniya Sajwan, Drishti Ratna, Amelia Singh and Sunny Singh first established the idea for their game, Magnifico, as part of a project in their year 12 business class. The students were told to create a product that could 'give back to the community' and to 'solve a problem' rather than focus on sales and profit.Amelia Singh, Saniya Sajwan and Drishti Ratna are three of the students who developed and are marketing the board game, Magnifico.
