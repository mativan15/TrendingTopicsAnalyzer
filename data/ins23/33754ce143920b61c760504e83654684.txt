Rapper Kanye West once again made antisemitic statements on Sunday - this time blaming "Jewish Zionists" for news stories about his ex-wife Kim Kardashian and her then-boyfriend Pete Davidson having sex in front of a fireplace in his latest antisemitic rant.

'It's Jewish Zionists that's about that life. That's telling this Christian woman that has four black children to put that out as a message in the media,' he said.

Kanye doubling down and blaming Jewish Zionists for it being public that Kim had sex by a fireplace with Pete.
