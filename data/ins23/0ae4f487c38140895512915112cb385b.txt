The firm delivers its application over the Internet as a subscription service using a software-as-a-service ("SaaS") model. AMPL allows companies to understand how their customers interact with their products and services, information that is vital to any business. Company Presentation Much like many of the IPOs that were introduced to the market in 2021, AMPL has very little to draw investors in from a fundamental standpoint, but hopes to do so through their potential and growth prospects.
