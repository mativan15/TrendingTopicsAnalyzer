Leona Lewis has celebrated 15 years since her iconic single Bleeding Love released, and we have never felt so old.
In December 2006, the global superstar, known for her insane whistle tones, defeated former Brookside star Ray Quinn by a landslide which resulted in her bagging the £1million recording contract with Simon Cowell's label Syco.
And to this day, Leona remains one of the most successful contestants of all time, even the late Whitney Houston offered to mentor the talented youngster while record executive Clive Davis signed Leona in the US for an astonishing £5million ($9.
