Every time Premier Blaine Higgs steps into a controversy about bilingualism, a couple of three-decades-old documents appear on social media and in reporters' inboxes.One is a leaflet from Higgs's 1989 leadership campaign with the Confederation of Regions Party, a virulently anti-bilingualism movement.At the top of his list of promises is a vow "to establish one official language — English."The other document is an 11-page brief Higgs submitted in 1985 to a commission looking at how to respond to a major, controversial report on bilingualism.
