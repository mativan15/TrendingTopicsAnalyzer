American Sign Language, used by the deaf to communicate through movements of the hands and face, is a step closer to being a new course in Washington County Public Schools.

Washington County Board of Education President Melissa Williams asked the curriculum and instruction committee at a business meeting last week to begin exploring how to add a new sign language class for the next school year.

"At one of our previous meetings, we had some discussion from board members as a result of some public comment made by individuals regarding American Sign Language," Williams said.
