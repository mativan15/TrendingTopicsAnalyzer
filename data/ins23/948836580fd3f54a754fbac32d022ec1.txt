Denver dive bar Carioca Cafe and Bar — known by most as Bar Bar — needs help as it faces forced closures and new licensing requirements, grinding to a halt the live music events that have kept the place in business in recent years.
'We've scraped by through COVID shutdowns without a fundraiser, but now we really need your help,' wrote Richard Granville, organizer of a new, $10,000 campaign aimed at shoring up the beloved dive on the east end of downtown Denver, on a GoFundMe page.
Granville is a local musician and bartender at Bar Bar who launched his campaign on Monday.
