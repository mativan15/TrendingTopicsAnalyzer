Love Island star Megan Barton-Hanson has officially become a millionaire, thanks to her saucy OnlyFans account. The X-rated subscription-based service allows content creators to earn money from users who subscribe to their account to see racy lingerie snaps as well as explicit content. Megan, 28, who shot to fame when she appeared on Love Island in 2018, became one of the first reality stars to sign up to the x-rated site in 2020. The blonde bombshell charges her subscribers $24.99 a month to access to her exclusive content – which also includes 'uncensored' photos and nudes.
