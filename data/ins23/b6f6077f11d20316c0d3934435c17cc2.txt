Taxpayers will have to pay as much as £4.5bn to cover the cost of honouring 'gold-plated' public sector pensions, as double-digit inflation prompts the biggest pay rise for retired public servants in a generation. 
The Government is facing calls to shake-up the generous public sector pension system, which legally binds it to increase ex-public servants' retirement income each year in line with September's inflation figure, which yesterday hit a 40-year high of 10.1pc. 
It means that the Treasury will have to spend an extra £3bn in pay rises across four of the largest schemes servicing the NHS, teachers, the armed forces and the civil service, according to estimates from wealth manager RBC Brewin Dolphin.
