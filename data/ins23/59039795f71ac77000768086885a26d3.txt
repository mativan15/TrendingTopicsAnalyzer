One year after the City of Iqaluit declared a water crisis that went on for two months, Nunavut's Health Department still hasn't initiated a third-party review of the way it was handled.

And its leaders won't explain why.

Iqaluit issued its declaration Oct. 12, 2021, after learning from the Government of Nunavut that the city's water supply had most likely been contaminated with fuel.

In the following weeks, test results from southern labs revealed chemicals consistent with diesel and kerosene were found in the water at the city's treatment plant.
