Since the start of the year, the 20-year-old has attracted plenty of interest, including from the Elland Road outfit.

What is the latest news involving Broja?

According to GOAL, West Ham, Newcastle United, Inter Milan, AC Milan and Napoli are all targeting Broja following his successful loan spell at Southampton.

The same outlet states that he could be sold for £25m, though manager Thomas Tuchel will take a look at him in pre-season first.
