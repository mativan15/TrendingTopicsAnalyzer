BERLIN: Germany's government plans to introduce a cap on electricity prices for households and industry to ease the impact of soaring energy costs, a ministry document seen by Reuters on Wednesday showed.To help finance the cap and pay for the stabilisation of power transmission grids, Berlin is considering skimming off some electricity companies' profits, the document showed.The scheme would also be financed by a 200 billion euro ($196 billion) relief package Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government announced late last month to help households and companies cope with soaring energy prices in Europe's largest economy.
