James Cleverly appeared to allude to suggestions claiming the Labour Party accepts substantial donations from trade unions as Liz Truss accused the party of backing widespread industrial action disrupting the UK. Mr Cleverly could be seen making the "money" gesture as the Prime Minister responded to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer on her staying in power despite mounting pressure for her to go. Reviewing footage of PMQs this week, Sky News' political correspondent Ali Fortescue noted the display was a showcase of the "theatrics" of politics.
