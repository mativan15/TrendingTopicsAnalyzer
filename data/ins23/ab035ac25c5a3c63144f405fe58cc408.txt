Published: 15:09 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 15:09 EDT, 21 October 2022 Oklahoma coach Porter Moser is glad to see some familiar faces this season. In his first year last season, the Sooners finished 19-16 and reached the second round of the NIT with a team full of transfers pieced together by a new staff during the pandemic. The Sooners still will rely heavily on transfers again. Moser will have just two players back who averaged more than 20 minutes per game. But Tanner Groves and Jalen Hill are key returnees who will provide some stability.
