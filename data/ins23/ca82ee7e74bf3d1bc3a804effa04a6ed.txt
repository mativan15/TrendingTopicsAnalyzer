The road to Omaha starts this week. Texas is looking to make trip No. 38 to the Men's College World Series.
Texas (42-19) was named the No. 9 national seed on Monday and will host the Austin Regional starting on Friday.
The Longhorns will open up the NCAA tournament with the Air Force Falcons (30-27). Texas took on Air Force earlier in the season as the two teams split a midweek set. Air Force took game one 14-2 and Texas stole game two 12-10 with a Trey Falitne walk-off home run.
Texas will likely be forced to pitch ace Pete Hansen against the powerful Air Force offense which ranks No.
