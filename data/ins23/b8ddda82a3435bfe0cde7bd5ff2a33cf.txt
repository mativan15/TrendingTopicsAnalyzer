United Airlines Holdings Inc. stock rallied after hours Tuesday after the airline said it expected the travel rebound to weather a shakier economy in the months ahead and reported third-quarter results that beat expectations. 'Looking forward through the end of the year, the airline expects the strong COVID recovery trends to continue to overcome the recessionary pressures in the macroeconomic environment,' company executives said in a statement. That backdrop — along with tighter flight networks and changes in how people work — helped justify the airline's more upbeat forecast for the fourth quarter.
