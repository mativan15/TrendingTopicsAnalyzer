The Cavalry FC are ready to kick off what they hope will be a playoff push to the Canadian Premiere League finals. They're hosting the Forge FC Hamilton at Spruce Meadows in the first of a two-game semi-final Saturday. Cavalry assistant coach Nick Ledgerwood told CTV Morning Live's Joelle Tomlinson Friday that the team is entering the playoffs on a high note. "We're almost hitting a peak in our season, which is nice," Ledgerwood said. "We're coming off two victories, one against the Valour and the other against Pacific at home, so I think the mentality (of our team) is just peaking.
