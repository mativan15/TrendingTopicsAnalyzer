The U.S. signed on to an online coalition's statement Thursday that condemned Iran's restrictions to internet access during nationwide protests over the death of Mahsa Amini last month.
The Freedom Online Coalition is made up of 34 governments that collaborate to advance internet freedom worldwide.
'In furtherance of what has become a long-standing pattern of censorship, the Iranian government has to a large scale shut down the internet yet again for most of its 84 million citizens nationwide by cutting off mobile data; disrupting popular social media platforms; throttling internet service; and blocking individual users, encrypted DNS services, text messages, and access entirely,' the FOC said in a statement.
