AgenciesFollowing the announcement, Nifty Metal declined nearly 9 per cent during the week, led by losses in the likes of JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Jindal Stainless, Welspun Corp, etc. NEW DELHI: Metal stocks were among the worst performers on Dalal Street during the last week, thanks to a surprise steep export tariff hike from the government.
