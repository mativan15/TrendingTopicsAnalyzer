While going to great lengths to promote itself as an environmentally conscious tech firm, Apple joined several industry associations that are 'fighting efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,' according to a new report from the Tech Transparency Project.

As recently as 2020, the company was an active member of several 'business groups that seek to thwart action on global warming,' per the report, which cites Apple's memberships with Business Roundtable, BusinessEurope and the Texas Association of Business, among other associations with soot on their hands, so to speak.
