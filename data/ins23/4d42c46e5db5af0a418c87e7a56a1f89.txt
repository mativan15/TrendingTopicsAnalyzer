Lecce is renowned for its cucina povera – it literally means 'poor cuisine', but refers to the tasty home cooking of rural families who make the most of seasonal, local produce. We are fortunate to have wonderful fresh vegetables – so dining out can be a vegetarian's paradise – along with seafood direct from the Ionian Sea. For an honest trattoria experience, you can't beat Alle due Corti, where Signora Rosalba cooks unforgettable dishes such as ciceri e tria', crunchy fried tagliatelle with chickpeas, polpette di melanzane, fried aubergine balls with mint and basil, a hearty fava bean soup with chicory, and the local favourite, orecchiette con cime di rapa – pasta 'ears' with turnip greens and anchovies.
