Insiders who bought US$3.2m worth of Playtika Holding Corp. (NASDAQ:PLTK) stock in the last year recovered part of their losses as the stock rose by 6.5% last week. However, the purchase is proving to be an expensive wager as insiders are yet to get ahead of their losses which currently stand at US$1.0m since the time of purchase.

Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.
