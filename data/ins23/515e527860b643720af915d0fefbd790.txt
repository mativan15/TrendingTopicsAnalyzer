ET Canada Harry Styles is nearing the end of his Love On Tour pitstop in Chicago, and it's apparent that even a bottle-throwing incident isn't going to dampen his mood or his view of the Windy City.The 'As It Was' singer was in the middle of his performance Friday night at the United Center chopping it up with fans, as is his usual manner, when, out of nowhere, some so-called fan inexplicably threw a bottle at Styles' direction. The bottle made a direct hit on the singer's crotch, and it was quite painful, as the bizarre act brought the singer's spiel to a screeching halt and an audible groan from the packed crowd.
