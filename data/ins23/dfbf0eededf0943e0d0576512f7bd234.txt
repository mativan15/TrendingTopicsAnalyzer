A startup out of New Jersey has designed shipping containers that can fold like an accordion.

The containers could help solve congestion at ports and shipping yards in the US.

Logjams at the largest US ports have receded, but remain above pre-pandemic levels.

A startup based out of New Jersey thinks it may have a solution to historic congestion at some of the largest ports in the US.

Staxxon is planning to sell shipping containers that can fold "accordion-style" and shrink to about one-fifth the size of a typical 20-foot or 40-foot container.
