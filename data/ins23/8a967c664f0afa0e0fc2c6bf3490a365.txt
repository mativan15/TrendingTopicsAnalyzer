Netflix viewers spent a lot of time with Stranger Things' super-sized fourth season over the weekend — a record-setting amount, in fact.
According to Netflix's internal measurement, Stranger Things racked up 286.79 million hours of viewing time worldwide from May 25-27. That blows past the previous record holder, season two of Bridgerton, which had 193 million hours of watch time over its opening weekend in March. Bridgerton went on to claim the title of Netflix's most watched English-language series of all time over its first 28 days of release, with 656.
