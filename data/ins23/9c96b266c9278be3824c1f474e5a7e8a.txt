Quebec City - The national assembly will be functional even if Québec Solidaire (QS) and the Parti Québécois (PQ) are not recognized with official party status, according to government house leader, Simon Jolin-Barrette. The outgoing Minister of Justice was asked to comment on the issue of party recognition on Tuesday in the hallway of the national assembly before the swearing-in ceremony for the 90 CAQ MNAs began. Jolin-Barrette said that contrary to what QS co-spokesperson Manon Massé said last week, there will be no 'mess' in the assembly if 14 of the MNAs sitting are independent.
