Bitcoin investors have been swept up in the market carnage this year, but those still holding on should expect at least 30% upside to the cryptocurrency from here, according to JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. He reiterated in a note this week that bitcoin's fair value is at the $38,000 level, which implies upside of about 32% for the cryptocurrency from where it's trading. On Friday at 12:30 p.m. ET, it traded at around $28,687. The strategist said the same thing in February , when bitcoin and risk assets more broadly were still on their way down.
