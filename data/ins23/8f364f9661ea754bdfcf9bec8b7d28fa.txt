(Bloomberg) -- Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.'s annual earnings forecast came in light of analysts' estimates, even as the company projected 'healthy growth' from its newer services. Profit, excluding some items, will be as much as $2.04 in the year ending October 2023, falling short of the $2.10 average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Annual revenue will increase 2% to 4%, adjusted for currency fluctuations, through fiscal 2025, the company said Wednesday in a statement.  HPE is transitioning away from reliance on the sale of hardware such as data-center servers, into services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
