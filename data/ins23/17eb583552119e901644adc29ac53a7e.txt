On Friday, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback, 45, attended New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft's wedding to Dana Blumberg by himself amid marriage troubles with his wife, Gisele Bündchen.

Kraft, 81, and Brady have a years-long friendship, given the NFL superstar spent the entirety of his football career with the New England Patriots before joining the Buccaneers in 2020.
