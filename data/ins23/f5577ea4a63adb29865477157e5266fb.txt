The Baltimore Ravens had enjoyed at least a 10-point second-half lead in all but one of their games this season. Some of those leads lasted or even manifested in the fourth quarter. And yet, the Ravens sit at just 3-3 despite their offensive success – most recently falling to the New York Giants after two late scores from Big Blue.

The trend is not one the Ravens are used to during Lamar Jackson's time as the team's starting quarterback. Baltimore is 31-2 in games they've led by at least 10 points in the second half since Jackson took over in 2018 through the 2021 season, according to ESPN's Bill Barnwell.
