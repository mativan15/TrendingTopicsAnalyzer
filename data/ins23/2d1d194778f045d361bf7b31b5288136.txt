In just a few days, an Emerson College student raised more than $25,000 to support the victims of the shooting in Uvalde, Texas. How did she raise that money you might ask? By selling t-shirts.  When the newest season of Netflix's 'Stranger Things' launched on Friday, Reagan Allen immediately knew she should recreate the design of the Emerson College shirt that one of the characters, Nancy Wheeler, is seen wearing in the show. The shirt features the Boston school's long-retired logo from the 1980s, the era that the show is set in.
