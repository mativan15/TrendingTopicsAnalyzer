Although pre-exposure prophylaxis, or 'PrEP,' medications can dramatically reduce a person's risk of getting HIV from sex and IV drug use, some groups who could most benefit from taking PrEP are usually not prescribed the drugs, according to a study led by researchers in the University of Maryland School of Public Health. Published recently in AIDS and Behavior, the research found that PrEP is underprescribed for Black people, heterosexuals, women, those with a recent sexually transmitted infection and those using illicit drugs, said Brad Boekeloo, a professor of behavioral and community health who led the study.
