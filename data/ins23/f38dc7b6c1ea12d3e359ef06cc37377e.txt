Alan Shearer has described the Champions League pre-match scenes and the way Liverpool fans were treated outside the Stade de France as "pretty disgusting".The former England captain told BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily: "It leaves a sour taste and so it should."So many people worked so hard and spent their money to get to an occasion after what everyone has been through in recent years."We sensed problems on the way in, and as soon as we got out of the car we thought there is something not right here.
