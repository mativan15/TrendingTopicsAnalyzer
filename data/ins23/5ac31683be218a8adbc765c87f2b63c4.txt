Published: 17:00 EDT, 4 June 2022 | Updated: 17:01 EDT, 4 June 2022 The British public hugely overestimates the size of minorities, sparking fears ‘woke' identity politics are warping views of society. When 1,800 people were asked by pollster YouGov how many people were transgender, for instance, they thought it was about five per cent of the population.In reality, between 0.3 per cent and 0.7 per cent identify as a different gender from their biological sex – the gap between the estimate and the reality appearing to show how the transgender rights debate has skewed perceptions.
