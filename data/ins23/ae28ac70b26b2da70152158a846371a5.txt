Ukraine is bracing itself for a very difficult winter, as Russia is looking to target the country's energy grid in a move which has led to Ukraine accussing Vladimir Putin of "terrorism". Over the past week, Russian forces unleashed a barrage of strikes on Ukraine's energy facilities, even hitting some apartment blocks and a major road intersection in the capital, Kyiv. Emergency services in the country warned that at least 20 people were killed following an attack last Monday. Experts note that this is likely a way to batter Ukraine as the cold winter months begin.
