Quebec's premier has promised Quebecers another cheque to offset inflation — if he gets elected again, that is.François Legault, speaking in the National Assembly Tuesday, said the province had underestimated the impact of inflation on daily expenses. The Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) government recently gave $500 to every Quebecer who filed a tax return and who made less than $100,000, despite experts saying it would contribute to the inflation problem."By the end of the year 2022, we will send a new cheque — if we're elected, obviously," he added.
