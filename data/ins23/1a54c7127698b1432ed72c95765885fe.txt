US stocks climbed Tuesday, extending gains from a day earlier, as stronger-than-expected earnings reports from Goldman Sachs and Johnson & Johnson added to the upswing. Both the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 futures climbed more than 2%, with Wall Street growing increasingly bullish despite a disappointing inflation report last week. "Big inflows in the last several weeks suggest that investors may believe that the market has bottomed," Bank of America analysts wrote in a research note on Tuesday.
