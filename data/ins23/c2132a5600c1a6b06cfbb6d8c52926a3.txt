Universal/Blumhouse's 'Halloween Ends' is still going to turn a sizable profit with an estimated $43 million opening weekend, but its day-and-date release on Peacock and weak reviews from critics and audiences alike are already having an impact.



Prior to release, the final installment in David Gordon Green's 'Halloween' reboot trilogy was projected to open to $50 million, matching the $49.4 million opening of last year's 'Halloween Kills,' which was also a day-and-date release. With a reported budget in the $20 million range — a departure from the sub-$10 million budget philosophy Blumhouse usually adheres to — 'Ends' is already set to make its money back.
