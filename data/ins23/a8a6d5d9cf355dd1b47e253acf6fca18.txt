Uber has announced the creation of an advertising division dedicated to helping brands "connect with consumers throughout the entire ride process." That's right. The entire ride.
The rideshare giant announced the division alongside a new ad platform called Uber Journey Ads, which addresses the troubling lack of advertising between booking an Uber ride and arriving at a destination.
Uber said it has already partnered with more than 40 "marquee brands" including NBCUniversal, Heineken, and United Artists, to deliver ads in a variety of places – in the Uber and Uber Eats apps, sponsored emails, in displays on top of cars, in-vehicle tablets, and so on.
