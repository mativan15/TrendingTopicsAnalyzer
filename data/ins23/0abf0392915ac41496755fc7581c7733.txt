One truly new fact that I have learned about financial markets in the last two years is that random silly enthusiasm from retail investors on social media can save a big company from bankruptcy. You have a somewhat nostalgic consumer-oriented company, it falls on hard times, it has too much debt, things look grim, short sellers are circling, and then some people on Reddit are like 'hey let's have some fun and stick it to the short sellers,' it becomes a meme, the stock rallies, the company raises money at the new high stock price, it pays off its debts, it expands into non-fungible tokens, the retail investors save the day.
