ReutersBritish new finance minister Jeremy HuntBritish retail sales volumes fell by a bigger-than-expected 1.4% in monthly terms in September, official data showed on Friday, as consumers felt the hit from rising prices. September's data was also affected by a one-off public holiday to mark the funeral of Queen Elizabeth when many retailers closed, the Office for National Statistics said.
 Economists had expected retail sales to fall 0.5%. Excluding automotive fuel, sales fell 1.5% from August. Consumers have been reining in their spending with inflation hitting 10% and they also face the prospect of a tighter squeeze on their spending power in 2023 after finance minister Jeremy Hunt scrapped tax cuts previously planned by Prime Minister Liz Truss.
