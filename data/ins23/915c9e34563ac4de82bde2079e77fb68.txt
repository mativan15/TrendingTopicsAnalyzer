The Ukrainian government's calls have been heard. On Wednesday, October 12, French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to deliver "radars, systems and [anti-aircraft] missiles to protect [the Ukrainians] from attacks, in particular to protect them from drone attacks." The French president made the announcement after a series of massive Russian strikes a few days earlier, which targeted several Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky even called for the creation of an anti-aircraft shield over Ukraine, asking, as a priority, for the delivery of high-tech air defense systems to protect the population and strategic infrastructure in the event of intensified Russian strikes.
