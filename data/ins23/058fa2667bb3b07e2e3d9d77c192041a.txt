Former Manchester United striker Dion Dublin has backed Cristiano Ronaldo to remain at the club until the end of the season, despite his goalscoring struggles. Problems in front of goal have spread across United's attack this term, and Dublin has suggested a solution to Erik ten Hag.Ronaldo has scored once in eight Premier League games this season, but he has started just twice amid doubts over where he fits in Ten Hag's desired style of play. Murmurs are growing about whether the 37-year-old could look for a way out in January rather than leaving when his contract expires next summer.
