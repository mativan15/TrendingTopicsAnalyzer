The `Palle Pragathi' programme of improvement of civic infrastructure in villages which commenced on Friday was marred by protests by sarpanches and locals against the failure of government to clear the pending bills of works already taken up in earlier rounds of the programme. Panchayat Raj Minister E. Dayakar Rao assured the villagers wherever he toured to oversee the programme that the government will issue tokens and cheques towards payment of pending bills. He said the government had released ₹9,560.
