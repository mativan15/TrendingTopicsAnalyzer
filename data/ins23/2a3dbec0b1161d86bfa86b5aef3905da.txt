Casey Dornbach wasn't sure what his future held last spring, other than that his career at Harvard was coming to an end after the possibility of playing one more season was ruled out. In October of 2020, the NCAA had granted winter athletes an extra year of eligibility, as the year was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.The Ivy League initially voted to not grant extensions, but changed course in February 2021 to allow that year's seniors to compete for a fifth year in 2021-22, provided they were admitted into graduate programs.
