Fidelity Investments cut valuations for several closely held technology companies, including social media platform Reddit and payment software provider Stripe. In April, Fidelity funds marked down stakes in Reddit by more than a third from the preceding month and Stripe by 13%, according to filings and data compiled by Bloomberg. Fidelity also cut valuations for TikTok owner ByteDance and for Instacart. The changes track a broad decline in public equity markets that punished technology stocks in particular, with the Nasdaq 100 tumbling 21% through the first four months of the year.
