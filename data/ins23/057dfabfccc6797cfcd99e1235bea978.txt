MUMBAI BJP, NCP and both camps of Shiv Sena have been trading barbs ever since the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government was toppled a few months ago. However, when it comes to cricket, those differences go for a toss with all of them aligning their interests. On Monday, city BJP chief Ashish Shelar and NCP supremo Sharad Pawar shared the dais during a voters' meet, urging them to back the Pawar-Shelar Group for the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) elections to be held on Thursday. On Tuesday, it was turn of chief minister Eknath Shinde and his deputy Devendra Fadnavis to address the voters.
