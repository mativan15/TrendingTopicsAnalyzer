PCMag's four decades of uninterrupted publication have included many highs and lows—along with the day-to-day work that comes with testing 2,000-plus products and services each year, dispensing endless buying advice, and covering important news as we chronicle the fast-paced world of technology. As the years wear on, even we've forgotten about a few major milestones.Thankfully, the 27 years of PC Magazine in print (archived at Google Books(Opens in a new window)) and the subsequent 13 years of being online-only, plus the many years of paper and pixel overlap, are all still available.
