Former 49ers and Tennessee Titans tight end Delanie Walker announced Tuesday that he is retiring from the NFL more than two seasons after he last played a game.
Walker played the first seven seasons of his career with the 49ers, starting in 2006 after the Niners picked him on the sixth round of the NFL Draft out of Central Missouri.
He recorded 123 catches for 1,465 yards and eight touchdowns with the 49ers before signing in free agency with the Titans in 2013 after reaching two straight NFC title games — and one Super Bowl — with the Niners in 2011 and 2012.
