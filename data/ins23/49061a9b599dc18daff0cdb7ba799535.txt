October 18, 2022 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time NORWALK, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Engaging customers is a challenge for utility companies, especially renters and low-and moderate-income homeowners because they may not need or be able to afford traditional energy-efficiency programs that are more widely adopted by other customer segments. One thing all groups have in common is that they own one – or more - smart phones, tablets, computers, and televisions. These devices are essential for people to stay connected to family, friends, work, education, entertainment and more, so when they malfunction or are damaged, it can be a major disrupter of daily life.
