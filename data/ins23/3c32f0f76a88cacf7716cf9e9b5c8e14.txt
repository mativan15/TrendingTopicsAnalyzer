A California woman made a stunning discovery after bringing home a set of sofas that she found on Craigslist: more than $36,000 stashed inside a cushion.Vicky Umodu of San Bernardino was browsing Craigslist in search of furniture for her new home when she stumbled upon a free listing that included two sofas and a matching chair.Umodu was initially wary of the free offer, telling ABC7, 'I said, ‘Maybe it's a gimmick. Let me call them.''Upon calling the family that was giving away the furniture, Umodu learned that a family member had recently died, so the family was selling everything at the late relative's property.
