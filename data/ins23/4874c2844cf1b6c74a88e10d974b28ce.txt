The Star's licence to operate its Sydney casino will be suspended from Friday, the NSW Independent Casino Commission (NICC) has announced.After 9am AEDT on Friday, the NICC will install a manager, Nicholas Weeks, to oversee The Star's casino business.This means The Star casino will be able to remain open for at least 90 days but the NICC chief commissioner, Philip Crawford, said that timeframe could be extended.Star has also been ordered to pay a $100 million fine.Mr Crawford said it was no longer in the public interest that Star remains in control of the casino licence but their public apology and acknowledgement of serious wrongdoing saved the licence from being scrapped.
