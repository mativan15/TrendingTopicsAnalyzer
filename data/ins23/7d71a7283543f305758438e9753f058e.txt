Abbott is voluntarily recalling several of its Similac ready-to-feed liquid baby formula products because of a bottle defect. The Food and Drug Administration announced the recall on Friday, stating that certain lots of Abbott's liquid baby formula products are being recalled because less than 1% of the bottles "may not have been sealed completely," which "could result in spoilage."According to the FDA, the impacted products are: Similac® Pro-Total ComfortTM, Similac® 360 Total Care®, Similac 360 Total Care Sensitive, Similac® Special Care® 24, Similac Stage 1, Similac® NeoSure®, Similac Water (Sterilized) and Pedialyte Electrolyte Solution.
