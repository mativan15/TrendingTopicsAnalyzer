A Conservative lawmaker submitted a letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson on Friday and another quit a role as an assistant to Britain's interior minister, putting new pressure on the prime minister over illegal parties at his Downing Street residence during COVID-19 lockdowns. Bob Neill, the chair of parliament's justice committee, said an official report on the parties issued on Wednesday showed a pattern of "unacceptable behaviour" over months during Britain's coronavirus crisis, and said he did not find Johnson's explanations to be credible.
