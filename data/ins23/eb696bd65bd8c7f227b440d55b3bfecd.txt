Chelsea and Liverpool stars would ‘love' for their respective clubs to sign departing Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba, according to Darren Bent.
United confirmed on Wednesday that World Cup winner Pogba would leave Old Trafford on a free transfer when his contract expires at the end of this month.
The 29-year-old is expected to return to Juventus, but a deal has not yet been reached and Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid both remain interested.
Pogba made 233 appearances for United and while he helped the club win the Europa League in 2017, his second stint at Old Trafford is generally considered a failure.
