The Gannett Foundation's annual A Community Thrives program, a $2 million initiative to help organizations and nonprofits around the country, has launched again this year, and groups in Upstate South Carolina are once again encouraged to apply.

Since the program's inception in 2017, more than $17 million has been donated through crowdfunding efforts and disbursed to more than 500 organizations.

A Community Thrives will accept applications for organizations looking to bring awareness to a project that focuses on community building with an emphasis on historically underserved individuals and groups.
