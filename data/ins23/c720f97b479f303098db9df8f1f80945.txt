Passive investing in an index fund is a good way to ensure your own returns roughly match the overall market. When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. That downside risk was realized by Genuit Group plc (LON:GEN) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 31%. That's well below the market decline of 1.8%. On the other hand, the stock is actually up 4.7% over three years. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 12% in the last 90 days.
