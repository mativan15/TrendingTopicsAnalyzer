An "overzealous" security guard at a Lidl supermarket broke a thief's leg after tackling him to the ground for shoplifting.

Leandro Da Silva, 28, kneeled on the man's body to restrain him, then grabbed another shoplifter and "piled" her on top of him.

Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Da Silva had received no training from his security firm before being stationed in the Lidl supermarket on Nicolson Street in the Scottish capital's Southside area.
