HOUSTON -- If this is the swan song for Yuli Gurriel with the only organization he's ever known, the seasoned Astros veteran is making the most of it.
Houston's 38-year-old first baseman went 2-for-3 with a pair of hard-hit singles in the club's 3-2 win over the Yankees in Game 2 of the American League Championship Series on Thursday at Minute Maid Park. He's now 9-for-22 in these playoffs, bringing his slash line to .409/.409/.682 (1.091 OPS) through Houston's first five games, all victories.
None of Gurriel's knocks had an impact on Thursday's outcome, as the Astros again rode the long ball to their win, this time via a three-run blast by Alex Bregman.
