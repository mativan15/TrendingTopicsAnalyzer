'Musk proceeded to make statements, send tweets, and engage in conduct designed to create doubt about the deal and drive Twitter's stock down substantially in order to create leverage that Musk hoped to use to either back out of the purchase or re-negotiate the buyout price,' the lawsuit states.
Mr Heresniak is seeking to have the lawsuit designated as a class action, allowing other Twitter shareholders to join it, and for Mr Musk to compensate the company's shareholders for the declining value of their investment.
