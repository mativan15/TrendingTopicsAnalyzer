Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Marquise "Hollywood" Brown suffered a foot injury during Sunday's loss to the Seattle Seahawks.

ESPN's Adam Schefter reported Brown, who told reporters initial X-rays were negative ahead of additional tests Monday, was seen in a walking boot following the game.

Brown started training camp on the active non-football injury list with a hamstring ailment and didn't return until being activated on Aug. 2.

He entered Sunday's game with 38 catches for 417 yards and three touchdowns on the season.
