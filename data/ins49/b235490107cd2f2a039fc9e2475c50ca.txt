At the recent release of textbooks in Hindi for first-year MBBS students, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan commented that doctors could perhaps start writing prescriptions in Hindi with 'Shri Hari' on top. A government doctor in Madhya Pradesh's Satna district put it into practice the same day. A prescription written in Hindi by Dr Sarvesh Singh, a medical officer of a primary health centre (PHC) at Kotar village, surfaced on social media on Sunday, PTI reported. It was same day when Union Home Minister Amit Shah released textbooks in Hindi for first-year MBBS students in Bhopal.
