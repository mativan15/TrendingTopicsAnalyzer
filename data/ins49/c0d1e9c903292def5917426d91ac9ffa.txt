After months of speculation and Easter egg-searching, Taylor Swift's 10th album Midnights has finally made its bow.

The album marks a return to form of sorts for Swift, who had ventured into a completely new sound and a more fictional style of songwriting with her last two releases, Folklore and Evermore. Midnights, on the other hand, though it's unique among her past offerings in the genre, does see the singer-songwriter return both to a pop sensibility and to more personal song subject matter.
