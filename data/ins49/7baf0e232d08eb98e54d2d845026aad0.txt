The Queen is now the longest-reigning monarch in history and has spent a staggering 70 years on the throne.

And, a Platinum Jubilee commemorative medal has been designed to be awarded, as a token of the nation's gratitude, to people serving the country in the Armed Forces and other frontline services.
