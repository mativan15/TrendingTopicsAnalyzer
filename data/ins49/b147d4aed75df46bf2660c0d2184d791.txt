INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) — Center Corey Linsley and wide receiver Keenan Allen are inactive for the Los Angeles Chargers Monday night game against the Denver Broncos.

Linsley is out because of an illness. Coach Brandon Staley said on Saturday that he thought Linsley's illness was considered 'just a 24-hour thing.'

Linsley missed the Sept. 25 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars after injuring his knee during the first half of the Sept. 15 game at the Kansas City Chiefs. Will Clapp is expected to get the start in Linsley's absence.
