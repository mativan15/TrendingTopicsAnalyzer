Maharashtra's politics may have turned vicious in the recent past, but when it comes to cricket, politicians not only adopt a softer approach but ally with an opponent against whom they are fighting a battle for survival.
Jitendra Awhad and Milind Narvekar, man Fridays of two of Maharashtra's tallest leaders, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and former Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray respectively, will be fighting for the post of councillor in the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) in the election to be held on October 20 from the Sharad Pawar-Ashish Shelar panel.
