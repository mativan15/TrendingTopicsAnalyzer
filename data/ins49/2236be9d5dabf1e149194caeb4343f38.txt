QPR SOFTWARE PLC STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE October 21, 2022, AT 9.00 AM

























QPR Software Plc's interim report January-September 2022: SaaS revenue grew in line with the strategy. Revenue and operating profit clearly fell short of the comparison period, weakened by the delivery difficulties of a few Middle East software projects signed in previous years. The partner ecosystem strengthened, and innovative process mining solutions were launched on the market.
