AsiaVision/E+ via Getty Images China Mobile (OTCPK:CHLKF) is an endurable, state-backed, heavy-moated, free cash flow dividend-oriented machine that is most likely fundamentally speaking the best telecom stock in the world. The intrinsic value of the company is currently being locked away behind the complexities of the US-China relationship, as is, unfortunately, the case with many China-based companies. However, unlike companies such as Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU), or JD (JD), China Mobile does offer immediately accessible shareholders returns in the form of an immensely attractive 9-10% dividend yield and in that sense represents a possibly superior approach to China.
