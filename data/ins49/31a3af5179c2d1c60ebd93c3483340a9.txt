The eyes of curious shutterbugs who visited the Pixel Photo and Video Expo rolled in awe at the pavilion displaying vintage cameras and accessories taking them back in time.More than 300 vintage camera accessories of various brands like Yashica, Fuji, Konica, Lubitel and Raven, and even early models of Canon and Nikon were showcased in the section.
'The oldest camera displayed is from the 1910s–Kodak's Brownie–while many vintage ones are still in working condition, maintained with sheer love for photography,' said V Shankar, member of the Executive Committee in Madurai District Tiny and Small-Scale Industries Association (MADITSSIA).
