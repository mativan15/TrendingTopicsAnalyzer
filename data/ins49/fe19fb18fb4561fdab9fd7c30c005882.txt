Deontay Wilder's manager has insisted the heavyweight will demand "truckloads of money" to fight Anthony Joshua next year. Wilder fought for the first time since last October at the weekend, when he wiped out Robert Helenius with a stunning KO inside the first three minutes. Wilder has several options on the table now, including a world title eliminator with Andy Ruiz Jr and a settling of his long-term rivalry with Joshua. Eddie Hearn revealed prior to Joshua's recent defeat by Oleksandr Usyk, that he had made a lucrative offer to make the fight between the Briton and Wilder but it was snubbed by the American heavyweight.
