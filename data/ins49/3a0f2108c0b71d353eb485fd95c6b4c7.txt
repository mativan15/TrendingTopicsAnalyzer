Congress MP Karti Chidambaram moved the Delhi high court on Saturday, challenging the trial court's June 3 order denying him pre-arrest bail in a case registered by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the alleged Chinese Visas scam. The matter is listed for hearing on Monday before Justice Poonam A Bamba of the high court. The federal agency had recently registered a money-laundering case against Karti and at least two others in the alleged scam of ₹50 lakh on the issuance of visas to 263 Chinese nationals in 2011 when his father P Chidambaram was the Union home minister.
