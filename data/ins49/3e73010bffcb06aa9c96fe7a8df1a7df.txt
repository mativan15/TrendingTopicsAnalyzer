The mattress company Eve Sleep has called in the administrators after succumbing to what its chief executive described as an 'economic tsunami'.The company, whose share price has slumped more than 90% this year, said it had received a number of indicative offers from potential buyers but none had progressed beyond due diligence.'It is heartbreaking to have to acknowledge that the best way to preserve value for creditors, those partners and suppliers that have helped us on this journey, is to now terminate the formal sale process and appoint administrators,' the chief executive of Eve Sleep, Cheryl Calverley, said.
