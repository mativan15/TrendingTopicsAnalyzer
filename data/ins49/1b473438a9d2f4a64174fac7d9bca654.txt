Once she got them home, she noticed that something was inside one of the sofa cushions; she pulled it out and found envelopes that had $36k in cash inside. What would you do? Umodu immediately contacted the family she got the furniture from and returned the money…and they gave her $2,200 as a reward. She told the press that she 'was not expecting a dime,' and the money will go towards a new refrigerator.
