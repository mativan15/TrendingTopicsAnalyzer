The Chargers will soon host the Seahawks, looking to pick up their fourth straight win before they head into the bye week.
The good news is that they may be getting back Keenan Allen, who has missed the past five games with a hamstring injury. Allen is questionable and will be a game-time decision, per Brandon Staley.

'He's closer,' Staley said on Allen.
Sebastian Joseph-Day is listed as questionable with an ankle issue, but Staley said he should play.
The bad news? Los Angeles will be without Dustin Hopkins (hamstring), Joshua Kelley (knee), Josh Palmer (concussion), and Donald Parham Jr.
