lucky-photographer I own three companies operating in the financial sector. One of them is a regional bank: Huntington Bancshares (HBAN). The other two are part of the financial data & stock exchanges industry: CME Group (CME) and Nasdaq Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ). I added Nasdaq to my dividend growth portfolio because it does two things for me. It gives me "technology" exposure, and it is a great dividend growth stock, unlike a lot of companies that people consider to be "tech" stocks. The company just reported earnings, which came in higher than expected.
