Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in a new interview said Democrats need better messaging on inflation, which has been top of mind to voters ahead of next month's midterm elections.

'Inflation's an issue, but it's global. It's global. … What's [the Republicans'] plan? They ain't got nothing. When you bring down unemployment, inflation goes up. … So in any case, [President Joe Biden] brought unemployment [down], cut it in half,' Pelosi told Punchbowl News in an interview published Wednesday.

'Inflation is there but it's global and not as bad as it is in some countries.
