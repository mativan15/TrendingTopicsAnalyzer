Millions of dollars in state funding may be headed to Memphis to help fight juvenile crime.

According to Mayor Jim Strickland, the Memphis Police Department (MPD) is eligible for $5 million of the $100 million pool.

'Juvenile crime has skyrocketed in Memphis,' Strickland said. 'Violent and non-violent crime.'

He said juveniles are the number one cause behind the rise in car break-ins and car thefts.

'In January, there were three youths caught breaking into cars on my street- 14, 15 and 17 years old,' he said.
