Manchester United dealt a blow to Tottenham's Premier League title aspirations with a dominant 2-0 win at Old Trafford, while Liverpool's upturn continued with a 1-0 victory over West Ham on Wednesday. Chelsea's winning run came to an end in a 0-0 draw at Brentford, which allowed Newcastle to close within two points of the top four with a 1-0 win over Everton. United are now just one point off the Champions League places and could leapfrog Chelsea when the sides meet at Stamford Bridge on Saturday after their most impressive display under Erik ten Hag.
