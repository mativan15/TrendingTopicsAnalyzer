(RTTNews) - Indonesia's central bank raised interest rates for a third policy session in a row, as expected, to rein in the rising inflation and to strengthen the weakening rupiah exchange rate, which was caused by increased capital outflows. The Board of Governors decided to raise the seven-day reverse repo rate, or BI rate, by 50 bps to 4.75 percent, the Bank Indonesia said on Thursday. Borrowing costs are at their highest since February 2020. The previous change in the BI rate was a 50 bps hike in September.
