Oswaldo Cabrera's first two months as a big leaguer have largely gone without much of a hiccup.
But Friday, in Game 2 of the ALDS, the Yankees standout rookie hit a bump in the road, both in left field and at the plate.
Cabrera could not come up with a tough pop-up in the 10th inning, opening the door for the Guardians in their 4-2 win and he also went 0-for-5 at the plate with three strikeouts, leaving four men on base in the process.
'That type of guy that I was in the game today is not the guy that I've always been,' Cabrera said.
