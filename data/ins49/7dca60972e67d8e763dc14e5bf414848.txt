Collider.com What are the ingredients of a truly terrifying horror movie? It's one of the few genres that gets away with not necessarily needing to rely on a classy script or Oscar-worthy performances. Instead, the major strengths of horror films reside in the filmmaker's ability to build atmosphere and tension. This is usually achieved through having the perfect blend of cinematography, editing, effects work, and perhaps most importantly, score. Having the perfect composition of film music married to the right scene is one of the all-time greatest things that a movie can have going for it.
