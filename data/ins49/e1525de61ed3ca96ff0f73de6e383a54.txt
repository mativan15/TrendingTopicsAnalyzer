China has made a decision to seize Taiwan on a 'much faster timeline' than previously thought, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday, shortly after China's leader reiterated his intent to take the island by force if necessary.

'There has been a change in the approach from Beijing toward Taiwan in recent years,' Blinken said in an event at Stanford University in California.
