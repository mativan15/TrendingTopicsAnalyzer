Karina Caverdos - Chernenko/iStock via Getty Images Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) reports bookings of shows growing at double digits. Estimates from analysts are impressively optimistic from now until 2026. If the company continues to offer new shows and products, and establishes new relationships with artists, Live Nation's stock valuation will likely trend north. Even considering risks from loss of personnel or changes in public tastes, I believe that the current stock price does not successfully represent future free cash flow.
