Raghu Sharma, 21, one of the victims in the kidney transplant scam, told mediapersons on Thursday that he had come to Delhi in April to find a job. However, all his belongings were stolen as soon as he arrived in the city, and he had to take shelter at a city gurdwara. Talking to reporters at the Hauz Khas police station, Sharma was the first victim of the racket that the police found. The police, however, said Sharma was yet to be arrested. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Benita Mary Jaiker on Wednesday said that a police informer led them to a person, Pintu Kumar Yadav, who told them that he was also targeted by the members of the kidney racket, but he got out in time.
