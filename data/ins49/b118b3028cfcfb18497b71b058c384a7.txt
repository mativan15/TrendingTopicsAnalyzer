RTI International (RTI), a nonprofit research institute, has recently established a strategic partnership with Carolina's Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) to build upon the success of existing collaborations and jointly seek out new research opportunities in areas such as data modernization, data science and team science solutions. 
The two institutes have closely collaborated on multiple large-scale team science projects over the years, including NCATS Data Translator, NHLBI BioData Catalyst and the NIH HEAL Initiative Data Stewardship Group.
