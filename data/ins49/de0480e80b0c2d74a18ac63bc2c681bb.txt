Google's first foray into smartwatches is here but is it a cutting-edge wearable or a sports tracker on steroids?

Tech giant Google has been firing on all cylinders recently with its new hardware lineup. From the Pixel buds Pro to brand new phones, the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, but now they have finally released their own brand new smartwatch, The Pixel Watch.



It's not too surprising considering Google's $2.1 billion dollar acquisition of Fitbit back in 2019, in addition to their ongoing support of Wear OS, Google's Android operating system for wearable and smartwatches like the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 and the Fossil Gen 6.
