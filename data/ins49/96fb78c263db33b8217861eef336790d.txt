When Meaghan McDonald got tired of paying rising rent, she bought a boat and lived aboard. That phase of her life is behind her now – she says "three years was long enough" – but it was during that time that her current business started to take shape. "I was hiking and I got to the summit and my backpack was starting to fall apart," McDonald said. She thought she could build a better bag, and drew inspiration from her sailboat surroundings. Soon, she was cranking out prototypes for bags made from recycled sail cloth.
