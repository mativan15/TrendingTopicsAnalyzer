John F. Kennedy was a sick man, but hardly anyone knew it, since the late president kept his health problems quiet (and lied about having Addison's disease, biographer Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote). Tom Eagleton was dropped as 1972 Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern's running-mate after it was disclosed Eagleton had received electroshock treatments for depression a dozen years previous.

Democratic presidential hopeful Paul Tsongas insisted during his 1992 primary campaign that he was cancer-free after undergoing a bone marrow transplant in 1986, even referring the media to his doctors to back him up.
