The parliamentary committee that will oversee the NACC began holding public hearings into the draft bill on Tuesday, with Labor, Liberal, Greens and crossbenchers asking officials and independent experts about key issues such as the definition of corrupt conduct.The Law Council suggested changes to ensure the commission needed a 'reasonable suspicion' of corruption before launching an investigation, while removing a concern about future corrupt conduct from the issue.Twomey, however, said the definition should be broadened to make sure it covered conduct by a third party – in her example, a parliamentarian – who deceived public servants into doing the wrong thing.
