COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — An international human rights group is urging Sri Lanka's government to withdraw draft legislation that would create military-run rehabilitation centers, saying it would give authorities broad powers to detain people without charge and place them at risk of abuse.

Rights activists and opposition lawmakers have strongly criticized the bill, saying it aims to suppress people seeking political reform and accountability during the country's unprecedented economic crisis. A lawyer and an opposition legislator have challenged the legislation in the Supreme Court.
