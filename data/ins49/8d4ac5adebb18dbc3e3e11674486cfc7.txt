Long-time Meta (FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg is stepping down from the role she held for 14 years. And for Meta, that means losing a key executive at a time when the business is undergoing a major transition from a social network to a metaverse company.

Without Sandberg, Meta loses a strong leader who guided the company, and a young Mark Zuckerberg, through numerous controversies, including appearing before Congress in 2018 to answer for Facebook's role in Russia's interference with the 2016 presidential election.
