Mike Franken deserves our grateful thanks; Chuck Grassley deserves our votes

Adm. Mike Franken deserves our grateful thanks for his service to the country. Sen. Chuck Grassley deserves our vote based on the aggregate body of his work on behalf of Iowans over a lifetime of service.

Grassley works tirelessly on our behalf each and every year, not just in election years. He is as vigorous and mentally sharp in his annual 99 county meetings as during his first campaign. His bipartisan leadership of the Senate Finance Committee was a standard that Hill staffers wished was the norm.
