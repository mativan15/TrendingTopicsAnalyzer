DUBLIN, Oct. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --  The "Effective Technology Transfer Training Course" conference has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
Technology transfer (TT) is an increasingly important part of the pharmaceutical industry, with companies expanding the use of third parties for both development and manufacture.
There are few formal guidelines around this subject, but regulators expect companies to get it right for both internal and external transfers. Poorly run transfers can be costly and impact product quality, whereas well-run transfers bring business benefits and assure product quality.
