Colorado's health department has created a resource page for residents seeking help finding baby formula for their newborns amid the national shortage.  
Hospitals in Colorado received shipments of baby formula over the weekend after the federal government used the Defense Production Act to increase the production of formula and authorized the U.S. Department of Defense to fly formula to the U.S. from abroad, the agency announced Tuesday.
'We want all Coloradans to know that during this stressful and difficult shortage, multiple state agencies are working to make every resource available and ensure that every family in need can get the information and assistance they need,' said Jill Hunsaker Ryan, executive director of the health department in a statement.
