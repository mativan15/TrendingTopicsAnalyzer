The Reserve Bank warned on Friday that there is a risk of high wholesale price inflation (WPI) exerting pressure on retail inflation. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its annual report that cost-push pressures from high industrial raw material prices, transportation costs and global logistics, and supply chain bottlenecks continue to have an impact on core inflation.

"The substantial wedge between wholesale and retail price inflation amidst a sharp rise in manufactured products' inflation poses the risk of a possible passthrough of input cost pressures to retail inflation with a lag, although slack in the economy is muting the pass-through," the central bank stated.
