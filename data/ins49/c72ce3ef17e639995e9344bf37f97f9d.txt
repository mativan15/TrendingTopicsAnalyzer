Newly acquired linebacker Deion Jones will hit free agency at the end of the 2022 season as he and the Cleveland Browns have terminated the last year of his deal. While Jones was scheduled to make over $13 million in 2023, none of it guaranteed, the Browns, Jones, and his agent have eliminated the conversation of an inevitable contract restructure next offseason.

With this move, the Browns do right by both Jones and his agent by letting him test the market should he rebuild his standing in the NFL over the next 11 games.
