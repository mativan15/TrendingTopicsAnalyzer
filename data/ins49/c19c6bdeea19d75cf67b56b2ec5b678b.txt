They promise to be solemn, heart-wrenching events, as London, Ont. prepares to mark the day four members of the Afzaal family were killed. A fifth member of the family, a young boy, suffered serious physical and emotional trauma. Organizers hope the observances will help in the healing and further the discussion focused on ending hate. The accused is facing four counts of first degree murder and one count of attempted murder. June 6 will mark one year since the deaths of Madiha Salman, 44, Salman Afzaal, 46, their daughter Yumna Afzaal, 15, and her grandmother, Talat Afzaal, 74.
