Here are Thursday's biggest calls on Wall Street: Morgan Stanley reiterates Amazon as a top pick Morgan Stanley said shipping and fulfillment remain "key profit drivers" heading into the e-commerce giant's earnings next week. "While we don't expect a ~$7bn 4Q EBIT guide our analysis of AMZN's fulfillment and shipping cost/unit growth in 2Q vs long-term averages (2Q showed scale driving efficiency across AMZN's overbuild) highlights the key profit driver." Barclays reiterates Apple as equal weight Barclays said it's standing by its equal weight rating heading into Apple earnings next week but expects the company to show "resilient" iPhone 14 Pro demand.
