The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy has announced a £31million in new support to help companies lower their bills by reducing their reliance on fossil fuels. The post-pandemic recovery boom, combined with Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent the wholesale price of fossil fuels like oil and natural gas to record highs over the past year.Now, even UK households are facing the effects of this crisis, as Ofgem announced last month that the price cap for energy bills could be raised to £2,800 per year by October.
