'Time be flyin'," it's said in Martin McDonagh's 'The Banshees of Inisherin." It's a sentiment shared by McDonagh and his two stars, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, who have reteamed 14 years after McDonagh's pitch-black feature debut, 'In Bruges.''It feels like not two days of passing,' McDonagh said, shaking his head, on a recent fall day in New York while Farrell and Gleeson, sitting beside him, eagerly agree. 'It feels like we just went back in the room and said, 'It's going to be a good one, isn't it?' says Gleeson.
