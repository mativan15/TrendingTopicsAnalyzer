Barstool Sports founder and CEO Dave Portnoy weighed in on the future of free speech in America Wednesday, telling "Varney & Co.," that it's headed down a "slippery slope" as Kanye West acquires free-speech app Parler and Elon Musk confirms a plan to combat Twitter bots. "They're all buying because of the different platforms, because they think they got regulated a little bit on it. And I don't think that's a bad thing; it's always a fine line in the sand with any of that stuff. Who gets to decide what's over the line?" Portnoy told host Stuart Varney.
