Inflation may lead to higher paychecks in 2023. More 2023 wages may be subject to lower tax rates next year than the previous year due to inflation adjustments to the 2023 federal income tax brackets and other provisions announced by the Internal Revenue Service this week, CNN reports. 'It is very likely that you would see more in your paycheck starting in January [due to the IRS inflation adjustments, which] tend to result in lower withholding for a given level of income,' said Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting, via CNN.
