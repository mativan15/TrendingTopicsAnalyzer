Allan Fung, the Republican nominee who has a very good shot of flipping the 2nd Congressional District in deep blue Rhode Island, says today's GOP is "definitely is not the old Republican Party of the past."The former longtime mayor of Cranston – Rhode Island's second-largest city – who made history as the first mayor of Chinese ancestry in the state, could make the record books again as the first Chinese American member of Congress from the nation's smallest state.The GOP was long a party dominated by White males, but Fung is a member of the most diverse class of candidates ever for House Republicans.
