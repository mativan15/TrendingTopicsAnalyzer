PORTSMOUTH, R.I. — About two years ago, 10-year-old Porter watched his father's close friend die from brain cancer. He knew it must have been hard for the friend's daughter, who goes to school with Porter, to watch her father become sicker. So he'd bake a carrot cake, wrap it up, and bring it over.It was the family friend's favorite type of treat. And he would nibble on it, as his nurse would finish examining him. Porter did that three or four times before the man died.At the same time, Porter's grandmother, who he calls 'Grandy,' was also suffering from a bout of cancer and was being treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
