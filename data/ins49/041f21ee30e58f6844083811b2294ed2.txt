Drivers have voted for what they consider to be the country's worst motorway services. 
Hartshead Moor East, on the M62 near Huddersfield, in West Yorkshire, is the least popular out of 119 services in Britain. 
Some 31,000 visitors were surveyed by watchdog Transport Focus and the Welcome Break-owned site received an overall satisfaction rating of just 80%.
Comparatively, the top five services in Britain had satisfaction ratings between 99% and 100%. 
At Hartshead Moor East, only three out of four (75%) visitors were satisfied with the toilets.
