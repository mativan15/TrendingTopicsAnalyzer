House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should look into whether the White House pressured Saudi Arabia to delay OPEC+'s promised oil production cut, Republican Tom Tiffany demanded in a letter to the congresswoman on Thursday.The Saudi government had claimed earlier that day that the US government had requested a one-month delay in the 2 million barrels per day production cut announced earlier this month. Putting off the cut, it implied, would postpone the surge in energy prices expected to accompany the move until after the US midterm elections.
