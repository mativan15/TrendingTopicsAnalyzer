As investors brace for a potential economic downturn, AT&T (T) is monitoring one barometer of consumer health: whether subscribers are able to pay their phone bills on time.

"In terms of overall delinquencies, and I've been saying this since the spring, we are probably slightly worse than pre-pandemic norms," AT&T Chief Financial Officer Pascal Desroches told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). "But all in all, really strong fundamentals."

The CFO expressed confidence in the company's ability to offset any impact on its business stemming from rising delinquencies or subscribers "trading down" their service.
