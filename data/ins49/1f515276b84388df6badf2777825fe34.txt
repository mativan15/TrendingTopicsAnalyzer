St. Paul's Bennett's Chop & Railhouse will open a second location in the former 517 on Main restaurant in Hudson, Wisconsin.

The Pioneer Press has a report on the plans by owners Joe and Meghan Bennett, who have run the St. Paul steakhouse on West Seventh Street since 2006. They plan to open the new location this fall.

They won't have to do much in the way of overhaul on the building. According to 517 Main's social media feeds, the Wisconsin restaurant completed renovations in January.
