Formula 1 may not return to Monaco next season as bosses appear unable to strike a new deal to host the legendary race. It is believed F1 bosses are unhappy with special privileges awarded to Monaco by former rights holder Bernie Ecclestone.Organisers in Monaco control its paddock club and TV feed and are allowed to broker their own sponsorship deals away from F1. However, disagreements over sponsors have reached boiling point this weekend with F1 bosses reportedly getting ‘annoyed' at Monaco organisers, according to Ted Kravitz.
