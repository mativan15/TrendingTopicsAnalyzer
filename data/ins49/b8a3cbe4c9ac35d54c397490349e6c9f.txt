The Chicago Bears haven't fared well against New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick.

Chicago is 1-5 against Belichick, and they've lost five straight games to the Patriots dating back to 2002. That lone victory came during Belichick's first year as New England's head coach, where the Bears won 24-17.

The last meeting between these two teams came in 2018, when the Patriots escaped Soldier Field with a 38-31 victory as a Hail Mary attempt fell short for Chicago.
