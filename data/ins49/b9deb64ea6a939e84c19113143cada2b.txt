Children are being driven into the clutches of drugs and gangs as the cost of living crisis hits family budgets, a youth leader has warned.  
Anton Noble echoed warnings from a national charity that the mounting financial pressures on households are putting young people at risk of criminal and sexual exploitation.  
He has seen first-hand how the soaring costs are affecting families through his youth service Guiding Young Minds (GYM), which works across several regions in England, mentoring and supporting young people.
