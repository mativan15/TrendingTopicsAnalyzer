The largest investor in Countryside Partnerships has urged the company to find a buyer after it rebuffed a £1.5 billion bid approach this week.Browning West, a Los Angeles-based hedge fund with a 15.3 per cent stake, has called for the board to conduct a review of the group, which the investor said would perform better if it was privately owned or as part of a larger business. It said that actions by the board had led to a 'significant destruction of shareholder value'.Its intervention came after Inclusive Capital Partners, or In-Cap, broke cover with a 295p-a-share take-private bid on Monday, effectively going hostile after the Countryside board had rejected two approaches.
