Hans Niemann, the 19-year-old American grandmaster at the centre of an alleged cheating scandal, is suing world champion Magnus Carlsen, online platform Chess.com and others for slander and libel and is seeking at least $100m in damages.
The lawsuit, filed at a US District Court in Missouri on Thursday, also listed Carlsen's online chess platform Play Magnus, Chess.com executive Danny Rensch and US grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura as defendants.
Niemann claimed that the defendants are 'colluding to blacklist' him from the professional chess world and that he has been shunned by tournament organisers since five-time world champion Carlsen publicly accused him of cheating.
