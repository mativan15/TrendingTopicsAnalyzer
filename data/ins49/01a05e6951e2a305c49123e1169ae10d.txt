(Bloomberg) -- Unilever Plc appointed Nelson Peltz as a non-executive director, sending shares to their biggest gain in four months on expectations the activist investor will shake up the slow-growing consumer-goods giant.Peltz will join the board in July and become a member of the compensation committee, London-based Unilever said Tuesday. His Trian Fund Management has taken a 1.5% stake in the company, which makes everything from Magnum Ice-cream to Dove Soap.The appointment looks set to heighten pressure on Chairman Nils Andersen and Chief Executive Officer Alan Jope to boost returns after a failed effort to buy the consumer division of GSK Plc infuriated some shareholders.
