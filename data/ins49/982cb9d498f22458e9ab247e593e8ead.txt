Bjorn Bakstad On September 15th, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported Q3 results and announced an agreement to acquire competitor Figma for $20 Billion in cash and stock. The market responded with a substantial sell-off, and analysts indicated that the deal was too expensive to make sense. This followed on the heels of a decline in the shares resulting from downgrades from Mizuho and BMO Capital Markets. The shares have climbed off of their late-September lows, largely due to reassuring management guidance on earnings for 2023 and reaffirmation of guidance for 2022.
