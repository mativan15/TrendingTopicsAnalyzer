Ovo Energy is preparing to gatecrash the takeover of bailed-out rival Bulb in the wake of a fall in gas prices.
Executives at Ovo have written to administrators to express a renewed interest in Bulb, which has 1.6m customers and was taken into temporary public ownership after running out of money a year ago.
An intervention would threaten current plans for a takeover of Bulb by Octopus Energy, which was left as the only bidder in an auction when others – including Ovo – pulled out of the process.
