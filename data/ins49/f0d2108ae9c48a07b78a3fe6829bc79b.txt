Members of the Tory party are putting together a legal team to prevent MPs from replacing embattled Liz Truss with a "quad of wets" led by Jeremy Hunt. Express.co.uk has been informed by a senior member of the European Research Group (ERG) that any attempt at a coup without having a full leadership election will end up in the courts.It comes as former Remainers on the left of the party are pushing a so-called "quad" leadership team of Mr Hunt, who was installed as Chancellor last week, Leader of the House Penny Mordaunt, former Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Michael Gove.
