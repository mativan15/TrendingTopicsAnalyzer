Strictly Come Dancing's Neil Jones and Love Island star Chyna Mills looked picture perfect as they attended the Black Adam premiere in London.
The couple were snapped on the star-studded red carpet in Leicester Square for the upcoming DC flick which stars Dwayne Johnson and Pierce Brosnan.
An official synopsis for Black Adam reads: ‘Nearly 5,000 years after he was bestowed with the almighty powers of the Egyptian gods – and imprisoned just as quickly – Black Adam is freed from his earthly tomb, ready to unleash his unique form of justice on the modern world.
