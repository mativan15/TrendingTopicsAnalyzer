Please give us some equity stock names, they would ask. This was a classroom on investing, in the early 1990s, fresh after the scam and the beginning of reforms. We still did not have the NSE, electronic trading or NSDL and demat. But we already had Sebi. And the government had done away with the Controller of Capital Issues (CCI). The markets were flooded with IPOs. That is why everyone who knew anyone who knew equity markets asked for names. Television those days was still retelecasting old Western sitcoms during equity market hours.
