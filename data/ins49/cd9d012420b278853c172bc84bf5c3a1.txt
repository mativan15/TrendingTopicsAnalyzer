Pendragon faces a shareholder revolt over executive pay for a third successive year after the car dealership group paid bonuses to its bosses despite receiving £64 million in taxpayer help during the pandemic.Glass Lewis, the influential shareholder advisory group, has told investors that the rewards for management are 'inappropriate' and incompatible with the 'significant' government support that Pendragon received, which the business has not paid back.It has recommended investors reject Pendragon's pay report at the company's annual meeting next month.
