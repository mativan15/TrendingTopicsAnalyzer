Molly-Mae Hague has admitted she thought she couldn't have children as she didn't fall pregnant despite having unprotected sex for three years.
The PrettyLittleThing creative director, 23, is expecting her first child with boyfriend Tommy Fury, also 23.
Molly and Tommy first met on the 2019 series of Love Island, where they instantly fell head-over-heels for each other and whose relationship has gone from strength to strength since.
