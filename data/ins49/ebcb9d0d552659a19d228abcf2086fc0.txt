Students of all ages and backgrounds, who—despite the pandemic—continued to pursue their educational goals at a University of Hawaiʻi Community College, are the stars of a new television, radio and digital marketing campaign to increase awareness among prospective and returning students. The 'Make it Happen' campaign also highlights the opportunities and value offered by the seven campuses across the state.

'There's a lot of options for me here,' said UH Community College student Raymond Berdon, an aspiring social worker.
