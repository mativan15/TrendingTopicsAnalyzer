The young Houston Rockets went 3-1 in preseason play leading up to the NBA's 2022-23 regular season, and electric numbers by second-year guard Jalen Green were a big reason why.
Green averaged 22.0 points (43.3% on 3-pointers) and 3.3 assists in 26.3 minutes, and his performance has clearly played a large role in the rebuilding Rockets overachieving expectations to this point.
Granted, the competition will get much steeper once the regular season begins on Wednesday, Oct. 19 in Atlanta. Opponents will be playing their rotation regulars much more frequently, and there is likely to be a greater attention to detail across the board.
