With the EC allotting 'mashaal' (flaming torch) as the poll symbol to the Shiv Sena headed by Uddhav Thackeray, party old-timers unspooled memories of the 1985 election when Chhagan Bhujbal, then a firebrand Sena leader, won a seat in the legislative assembly with 'mashaal' as his symbol. His poll victory sparked the Sena's rise in Mumbai politics. The Sena was not registered at that time and did not have a fixed symbol, so Bhujbal had to pick one, sources in the party said.
