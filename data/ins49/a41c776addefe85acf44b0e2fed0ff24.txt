Knives Out director Rian Johnson has publicly confirmed that Benoit Blanc, portrayed by Daniel Craig, is "obviously" gay.

During a press conference at the London Film Festival, the filmmaker was asked about the possibility of Blanc being queer as a scene in the upcoming Glass Onion sequel suggested that the main character was living with another man. "Yes, he obviously is," Johnson answered. "And there's nobody in the world I can imagine in bringing me more joy for Benoit Blanc to be with," he continued, referring to still-unnamed actor who cameos as Blanc's partner.
