The Tennessee Titans shuffled around the deck chairs on their practice squad on Tuesday with the addition of two players and the release of one.

The moves all involved defensive backs, as the Titans signed Steven Parker and Kyron Brown, while also parting ways with Nate Brooks.

Parker was originally signed as an undrafted free agent out of Oklahoma in 2018. He landed with the Miami Dolphins in 2019, where he saw the field for 14 games (four starts), tallying two picks and three passes defensed.
