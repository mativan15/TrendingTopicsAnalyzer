I recently sold my condo and put the equity earned (over $200,000) towards a new condo I own with my partner. My partner — we are not married — is on title, but not on the mortgage. He pays half of all expenses monthly without fail. What would be the best way to document and protect my equity in the event that we split up? File this under 'R' for 'real estate' or 'R' for 'ruh-roh.' If he is on the title, he should be on the mortgage. It creates an imbalance of power within the property ownership agreement.
