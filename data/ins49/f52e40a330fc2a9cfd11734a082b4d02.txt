Dear Editors
Like Dr Salisbury wrote, yesterday, when we were young(er), we learnt to have fun when there was no power. We made up games and things to do without tools and gadgets that needed electricity; information and entertainment alike can be derived from paper and books.
And now we live in a very different world where priorities are different and many brains are more attuned to convenience and self-satisfaction rather than application (I won't bore the readers on how many times my eyes roll when someone needs to use their phone-calculator to perform simple arithmetic).
