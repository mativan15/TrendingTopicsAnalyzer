Scores of pistols and several sticky IEDs have been smuggled into Jammu and Kashmir, raising concern among security forces. The UT has seen targeted attacks against policemen, minority community members and social media users recently. The influx of pistols and sticky IEDs threaten peace this summer, especially during the 43-day Amarnath yatra starting in the last week of June. The J&K administration is preparing to host around six to eight lakh pilgrims, the highest in yatra history.

The officials across agencies and forces operating on the ground confirm that huge consignments of pistols, including US-made Canik-TP9, have been delivered in different parts of the Valley to create fear.
