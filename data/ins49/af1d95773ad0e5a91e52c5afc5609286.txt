Jaipur: Power minister Bhanwar Singh Bhati on Monday launched the Saur Krishi Aajeevika Yojana (SKAY) scheme portal to facilitate farmers to install solar plants on their barren or underutilised land. Under the (SKAY) scheme, farmers can give their barren land on lease to set up solar plants, which would help them elevate their living standards. The new online portal will be a platform where farmers and landowners can register their land to give on lease. While talking to media during the launch, Bhati said, 'The portal will act as a bridge to connect farmers and companies setting up solar plants in the state.
