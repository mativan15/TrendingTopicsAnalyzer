Florida baseball kept its season alive on Sunday night with a clutch win over the Oklahoma Sooners in the Gainesville Regional at Condron Family Ballpark, forcing a final elimination game against the same opponent on Monday. The winner of that game will advance to face the Virginia Tech Hokies, who defeated the Columbia Lions in the Blacksburg Regional bracket.

True freshman Carsten Finnvold spun nine innings of two-run ball to shut down the Sooners — but that is not the impressive part. He entered the game in relief of Timmy Manning after the latter allowed the first three runners on base without recording an out, with two reaching on walks and the other hit by a pitch.
