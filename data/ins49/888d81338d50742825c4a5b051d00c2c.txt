Xinhua | Updated: 2022-10-21 09:08 BUDAPEST -- The government of Hungary rejects all proposals that would damage economic cooperation between the European Union (EU) and China, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto said here on Thursday.
"There is a serious issue on the European agenda, and this is the possible destruction of the European-Chinese economic cooperation, which we definitely have to reject because, if the ties between European and Chinese companies and businesses were cut, it would have severe economic consequences for Europe," he told the participants in the second Hungarian Battery Day conference.
