The 39th CHEO Telethon this weekend comes as Ottawa's children's hospital faces pressing issues following two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Wait times for crucial care and procedures grew longer during the pandemic, and the hospital is facing new needs for care of depression, anxiety and eating disorders. CHEO president and CEO Alex Munter tells CTV News Ottawa your donations can have an impact on children, youth and their families facing challenges from the pandemic. "It's been a tough couple of years for parents, for kids and particularly for parents whose kids have special needs, are facing physical health/mental health issues and we're now dealing with the two years of pandemic, which includes a lot of backlogs in care and new needs like we've seen, for example, an increase in depression, anxiety, eating disorders," Munter said.
