PRAGUE, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The German government is aiming to cushion an expected recession with its investment programmes, but without fuelling inflation, Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Monday."We have a chance with the right stimulation to manage both: to cushion the recession, maybe not even to let it get too deep and too long, and at the same time not to fuel inflation," he told the German-Czech Economic Forum in Prague."That is the combination we are undertaking with the various investment packages in Germany.
