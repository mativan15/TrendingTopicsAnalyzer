Not only does Parlour Bar have incredible burgers, might the best in the entire state, but they're also putting their money where their food is. Donating a portion of proceeds to Everytown, throughout June. And it doesn't have to just be a burger....they'll donate a portion of all sales in June. Click the post below for all the details!
