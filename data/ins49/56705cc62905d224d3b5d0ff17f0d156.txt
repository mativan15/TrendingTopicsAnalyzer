LVMH Moet Hennessy (LVMUY 3.48%) (LVMHF 1.15%), the world's largest luxury goods maker, just announced solid third-quarter results. For the period ended Sept. 30, revenue rose 27% year over year to 19.76 billion euros ($19.21 billion). And for the first nine months, revenue was up 28% to 56.49 billion euros ($54.93 billion).
Those robust growth rates indicate that LVMH, which owns 75 major brands across five major categories -- wines and spirits, fashion and leather, perfumes and cosmetics, watches and jewelry, and selective retailing -- remains resistant to inflation and other macroeconomic headwinds.
