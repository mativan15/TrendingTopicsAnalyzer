United Airlines is the first international airline to offer free flights to import baby formula from the United Kingdom amid the ongoing shortage. Operation Fly Formula, the President Biden administration's effort to combat dwindling baby formula supplies in the U.S., is utilizing transportation infrastructure from United to bring over 300,000 pounds of Kendamil formula from Europe, according to a White House press statement. The operation will formally begin on June 9, and will be made available to the public as it rolls in.
