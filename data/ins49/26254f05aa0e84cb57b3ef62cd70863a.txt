Published: 08:54 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 08:54 EDT, 20 October 2022 By Steve Keating Oct 20 (Reuters) - The Haas Formula One team will have payments and money transfer company MoneyGram as their title sponsor from next season in a multi-year deal that will provide a welcome infusion of cash for the series' only U.S. based outfit. The backing was officially announced at a coffee shop in downtown Austin on Thursday ahead of this weekend's U.S. Grand Prix at the Circuit of the Americas. Haas entered F1 in 2016 and have spent much of that time without a title sponsor other than Haas Automation, the company of machine-tools industrialist and team owner Gene Haas.
