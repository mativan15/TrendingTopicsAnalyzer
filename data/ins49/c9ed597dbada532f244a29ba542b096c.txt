NEW BRITAIN — In their second debate of the week, Democratic U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes and Republican challenger George Logan traded barbs and visions for the 5th Congressional District in an hour-long back-and-forth over their individual legislative records and hardball partisan politics.

Hayes says she has earned a third two-year term in Washington because she has succeeded in supporting families and businesses through the pandemic and a flurry of legislative successes this year including $5 billion for infrastructure improvements in Connecticut over the next five years; temporary child tax credits that kept families out of poverty; the first bipartisan attempt at national gun-safety legislation in decades; and $35 a month limits on the cost of insulin for senior citizens that Republicans refused to expand to include children.
