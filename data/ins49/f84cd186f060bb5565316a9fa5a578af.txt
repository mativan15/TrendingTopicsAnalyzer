Kanye West is acquiring the libertarian-leaning social network Parler, the company announced on Monday, just days after his Instagram and Twitter accounts were temporarily locked for a spate of posts that were criticized for being anti-Semitic.

'In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves,' said musician and fashion designer West, now known as Ye, in a statement released by Parlement Technologies, which operates Parler.
