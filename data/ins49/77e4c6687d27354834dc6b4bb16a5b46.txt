Mining giant BHP has warned of a rocky road ahead after seeing coal output fall because of labour shortages and adverse weather conditions.Mike Henry, 56, chief executive of BHP, said: 'We expect global macroeconomic uncertainty in the short term to continue to affect supply chains, energy costs, labour markets and equipment and materials availability.'BHP, widely known as the 'Big Australian', was dual-listed in both London and Sydney until January this year, when it opted for a primary listing in Australia and therefore relinquished its place in the FTSE 100, although it retains a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange.
