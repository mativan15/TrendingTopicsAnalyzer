Shares of rail operator CSX Corp. moved higher after hours on Thursday after the company reported third-quarter results that beat estimates, helped by higher prices and fuel surcharges. CSX CSX, -3.01%, whose rail network covers much of the nation's territory east of the Mississippi River, reported net income of $1.11 billion, or 52 cents per share, compared to $968 million, or 43 cents per share, in the prior-year quarter. Sales came in at $3.9 billion, compared to $3.29 billion a year ago, helped by higher fuel surcharges and pricing gains, company executives said.
