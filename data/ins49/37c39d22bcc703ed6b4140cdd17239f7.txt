Jill Biden has opened up about her relationship with husband President Joe Biden and how they have handled their arguments through text messages.The First Lady recalled how she and Joe, who've been together for over 40 years, have communicated with each other during an interview with Harper's Bazaar, which saw her pose on the cover of the magazine's June-July issue.According to Jill, in order to avoid having spats in front of the Secret Service, back when Barack Obama was president, they would stick to having their disagreements through text messaging, a routine to them that is known as 'fexting'.
