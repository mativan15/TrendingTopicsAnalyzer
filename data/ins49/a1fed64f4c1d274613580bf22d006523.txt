The call by Auckland's mayor-elect Wayne Brown to stop the council and its water company from working on the Government's Three Waters reforms has been called 'clickbait politics' by a former councillor. Brown has written to Watercare and Auckland Council demanding both stop and asking how much had been spent so far. The call was detailed in his daily media release on Monday. Three Waters was a feature of Brown's election campaign leading up to the October local election, where he pledged to 'stop it'.
