Throwing arms are being fine-tuned and window displays prepared ahead of Gumboot Friday fundraisers in Timaru. The Timaru Gumboot Army is raising money for Gumboot Friday, on November 4, with a Gumboot Throwing Competition at the Shearers Quarters on October 29, a window display competition from October 23 to November 6, a quiz night on November 30, and 24-hour walk on November 4 and 5. Gumboot Friday raises money for free counselling for five to 24-year-olds throughout the country. Gumboot Friday South Canterbury regional co-ordinator and Timaru Gumboot Army member Andrea Hurst said following the success of last year's inaugural gumboot throwing competition, the group was looking forward to raising more awareness, and raising money for a good cause.
