As veteran forward Udonis Haslem prepares for the start of his 20th NBA season, he's also preparing the Miami Heat and himself for the end.

When the Heat opens the regular season on Wednesday against the Chicago Bulls at FTX Arena, it will mark the start of Haslem's final NBA season before he embarks on the next phase of his life, which he hopes includes a spot in the Heat's ownership group.

'Most people just told me to make sure that the people around you enjoy it because those are the people that sacrificed so much over those 20 years,' Haslem said of the advice he has received on how to handle the final season of his playing career.
