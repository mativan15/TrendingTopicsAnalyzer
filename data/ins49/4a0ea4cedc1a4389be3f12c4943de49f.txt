Central African refugees in Cameroon ©EC/ECHO/Thomas Dehermann-Roy 06/05/2014 - The EU is increasing its life-saving assistance to refugees of the Central African crisis by €6 million. The new funding tops the previous €4 million aid to Central African refugees since the country's crisis escalated last December. It will help the refugees meet their basic needs including shelter, food, health, protection, water, sanitation and hygiene. The money will be split between Cameroon and Chad, which are facing huge influxes of refugees, (70 000 and 8 000 refugees respectively).
