STORY: Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer asked an urgent question of Truss following Truss's decision to replace former finance minister and close ally Kwasi Kwarteng on Friday (October 14) only 38 days into the job.Truss's absence, amid criticism of her and Kwarteng's much-criticized mini budget in September, drew condemnation from Starmer."I guess under this Tory government everybody gets to be prime minister for 15 minutes," said Starmer.Mordaunt told assembled lawmakers that Truss was engaged "on urgent business" but did not elaborate other than to say there were "very serious matters as well as economic matters" that prevented her from appearing.
