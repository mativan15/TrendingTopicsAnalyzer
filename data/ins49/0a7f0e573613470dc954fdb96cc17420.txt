Banchero can begin to back up the Magic's faith in him during their season opener at Detroit on Wednesday. In five preseason games, Banchero averaged 14.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 1.2 steals in 24.2 minutes. "I just feel like I'm that level of player," Banchero said, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
