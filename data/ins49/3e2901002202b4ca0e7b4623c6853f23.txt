M﻿arco Silva says Thursday's game against Aston Villa is a good opportunity for Fulham to end their three-match winless run.T﻿o do that, he has urged his side to cut out sloppy mistakes, like conceding in the first minute against Bournemouth last time out.T﻿he Cottagers boss said: "It's always a good opportunity to fight for the three points and to perform well, that is really important for us as well."At the same time, we know it is a tough challenge against a very good team with quality players.
