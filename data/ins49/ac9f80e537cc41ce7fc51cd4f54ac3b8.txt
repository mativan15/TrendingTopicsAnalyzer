Alabama's coaching staff has already begun to recruit for the 2024 recruiting class. On Monday, the staff extended an offer to 2024 small forward Jalen Shelley.

Shelley is the seventh small forward that the Crimson Tide has offered up to this point in the 2024 class. The Texas native has the prototypical size to play small forward in Nate Oats' offense. He stands at 6-foot-7 and 175 pounds. Shelley can stretch the floor and be useful at the three in Alabama's lineup.

Nonetheless, it will be interesting to see how Alabama decides to pursue Shelley in the future.
