The lawyer for Andrew Gillum has asked that he be tried separately from his co-defendant, Sharon Lettman-Hicks, so that she can testify in his defense – a move he said is 'key' to his acquittal.

David Markus, a Miami lawyer representing Gillum, filed a motion to sever the two defendants on Monday, days after attorneys for Lettman-Hicks made a similar request for different reasons. The motions are pending before U.S. District Judge Allen Winsor.

Markus wrote that if Gillum and Lettman-Hicks are tried together, she may invoke her Fifth Amendment rights and opt not to testify.
