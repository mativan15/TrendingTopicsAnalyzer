(Bloomberg) -- Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the Biden administration's investments in semiconductors and clean energy will help address sluggish productivity and labor force growth that have dogged the US economy.'With an economy at full employment, I argued that now is the right time for a supply-side expansion that increases our productive capacity and reduces inequality,' Yellen said, according to the text of remarks she's scheduled to deliver Friday, at the Virginia Innovation Partnership Corp.
