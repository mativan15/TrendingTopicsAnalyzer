Diwali — also known as Deepavali — is a festival of lights that is traditionally commemorated with diyas — small earthen pots — on which oil is poured and a cotton wick is lit.
In the days leading up to the festival and on the day of it — especially in the evening — people light these diyas and decorate their homes: doors, balconies, etc.

A major festival celebrated predominantly by the Hindu community in India and around the world, Diwali marks the victory of good over evil, and the elimination of darkness by illuminating with positivity.
