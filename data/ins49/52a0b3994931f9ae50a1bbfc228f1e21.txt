Sainsbury's (SBRY.L) is ramping up efforts to keep a lid on prices amid a cost of living crisis and will spend £500m ($632m) between March 2021 and March 2023 to keep costs down.

Milk, eggs, meat, fish, fruit and vegetables and 'key household essentials' would be the targets for retaining lower prices, Sainsbury's said.

"Our commitment to saving money and reinvesting where it can make the biggest difference to customers means we are now able to commit a total of over £500m to lower prices and help customers manage inflation," said Sainsbury's.
