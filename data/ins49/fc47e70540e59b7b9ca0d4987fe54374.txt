The Maharashtra government on Thursday deposited an amount of nearly Rs 2,500 crore in the accounts of around 6.90 lakh farmers, with each getting Rs 50,000 as an incentive for on-time payment of crop loan.
The previous Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, while announcing the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule farm loan waiver scheme after coming to power in 2019, had announced that those farmers who repay the crop loan on time will get an incentive. Initially, the amount was Rs 25,000, which was later revised to Rs 50,000.
