BOLGATANGA, Ghana — A nurse dressed in a white hazmat suit stands at a rickety wooden table folding surgical instruments into sheets of blue paper and placing them into a cardboard box on the floor. Next to her sits a white microwave-looking machine, one that is supposed to help sanitize scalpels and forceps, but is on the fritz — the door keeps popping open.

'We have to try and sanitize each tool individually ourselves,' she says. 'Then we wrap it to save it for the next surgery.'

It's hardly the ideal way of cleaning and storing tools, but it is the only option for the health care staff here at Kings Medical Center in Bolgatanga, located in the Upper East Region of Ghana near the border of Burkina Faso.
