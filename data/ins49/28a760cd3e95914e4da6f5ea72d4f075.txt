Oliver Gunning is still revelling in a ‘rollercoaster' summer that saw him compete at the Commonwealth Games before achieving a best ever career result.

The Co Antrim ace, who races alongside guide Kyle Duncan, competed at an array of World and European series events this summer in addition to the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.

There were mixed emotions for the paratriathlete after his Commonwealth bow, who took significant joy from the atmosphere despite a crash on the bike leg hampering his race.
