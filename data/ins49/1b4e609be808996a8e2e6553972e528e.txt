John Legend will miss Blake Shelton on The Voice.
 
While speaking with Entertainment Tonight for a recent interview, the R&B singer, 43, said he is going to miss working with Shelton, 46, as a friend and fellow coach on the singing competition series.
 
"He's been doing the show for 22 seasons, it'll be 23 when he's done, and you can't do something forever," Legend said.
 
"We're going to miss him though, he has been the heart and the anchor and the soul of the show for a long time, and he's a friend of mine and I really enjoy working with him," he added.
