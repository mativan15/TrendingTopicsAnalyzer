Welcome to Thursday, loyal readers. Here's what you need to know today.

New local eateries

I have two notable openings to report on the local food and drink scene.

In August, my colleague Jake Abbott told you that Midtown Lounge would replace Cider House at 1111 24th St., Suite 102, in Midtown Sacramento. Update: The business, which will serve local brews and food, will hold a grand opening on Friday, operators announced on social media.

Also on Friday, the operators of Urban Roots Brewing & Smokehouse will officially open their new concept at the East Sacramento space previously known as The Shack.
