KYIV — Residents of the Ukrainian capital on Monday were once again woken by air raid sirens and explosions as Russia launched a large scale assault on the city, using their new Iranian supplied 'Shahid-136' suicide drones, almost exactly a week after their last attack on Kyiv. According to Mayor Vitali Klitschko, at least four people were killed.The barrage of remote-piloted 'kamikaze' aircraft began at a little after 6:40 a.m. Multiple explosions and gunfire could be heard across the city, as the drones flew slowly towards their targets.
