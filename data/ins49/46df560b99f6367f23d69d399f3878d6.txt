After months of speculation, Silent Hill is finally back. Ten years on from the last entry in the legendary horror series, Konami has announced not just one new Silent Hill, but three.Released in 1999, the original Silent Hill was an instant creepy classic, out-scaring Resident Evil with its darker tale of a strange New England town, where monsters lurked in a mysterious fog. The 2001 sequel, Silent Hill 2, is routinely listed as one of the most frightening games ever made. A remake of the latter spearheads this revival.
