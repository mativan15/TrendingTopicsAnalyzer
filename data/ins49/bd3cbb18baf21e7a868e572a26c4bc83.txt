Is it possible for Boris Johnson to return to No 10? He must first secure the support of 100 Conservative MPs to make it onto the leadership ballot.
Yet a Telegraph analysis of those already publicly backing the former prime minister for another term gives him cause for optimism.
As of midday on Friday, a total of 38 MPs have publicly thrown their support behind Mr Johnson. 
And despite backbenchers turning on him in their droves just three months ago, the pool of MPs available from the factions now backing Boris could propel him over the threshold.
