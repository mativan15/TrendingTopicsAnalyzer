(Bloomberg) -- Jamie Dimon makes a point of introducing himself to new chancellors of the exchequer in the UK, where JPMorgan Chase & Co., the bank he runs, has a large presence. It's a task that's keeping him busy lately. Dimon spoke with Kwasi Kwarteng during the latter's five-week stint in charge of Britain's purse strings, when he was told the government would prioritize the growth of financial firms. Next week, the American executive is due to pick up the phone to Kwarteng's successor, Jeremy Hunt, for a different conversation about the threat of a tax hike.
