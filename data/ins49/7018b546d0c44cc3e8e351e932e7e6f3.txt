Sony has started using a new system to set the price of cars in Gran Turismo 7 and fans think it's just an excuse to push microtransactions.
Gran Turismo 7 is a good game but Sony and developer Polyphony Digital seem committed to ruining its reputation by the way they're handling in-game purchases of cars.
They've already had to perform one U-turn, over a patch that made it harder to earn in-game credits and which many claimed was a ploy to push players into spending real money on microtransactions.
