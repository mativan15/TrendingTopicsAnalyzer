-London shares held on to their early gains on Monday as new finance minister Jeremy Hunt said the government would reverse almost all the tax measures announced by Prime Minister Liz Truss's economic growth plan three weeks ago to end bond market rout that has slammed UK markets.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index gained 0.5%, while the domestically focussed FTSE 250 index climbed 1.0%.

Newly elected Chancellor Jeremy Hunt scrapped almost all parts of Prime Minister Liz Truss's mini budget, saying reversing the proposed tax cuts would help the government raise around 32 billion pounds ($36.
