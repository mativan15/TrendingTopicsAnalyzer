peepo/E+ via Getty Images Overview Vertical Aerospace Ltd. (NYSE:EVTL) is currently massively undervalued. EVTL is a strong contender in the emission-free electric vertical takeoff and landing [eVTOL] industry that has a large total addressable market ("TAM") potential. Because EVTL is not currently making any significant revenue or profits, and because the company has a lot to show the market (which translates to higher execution risk), I believe this has resulted in a significant value mismatch between the current market price and its intrinsic value.
