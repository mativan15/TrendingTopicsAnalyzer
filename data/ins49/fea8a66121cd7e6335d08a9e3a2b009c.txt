Expert dancers twisting around to salsa music , mothers with babies in prams, children in raincoats  and families- the volunteer run Harvest Launceston Market on Saturday in a big parking lot opposite the Albert Hall in  Launceston, Tasmania's second biggest city, is a heartwarming community scene with a happy vibe, where locals mingle, do their weekly grocery shopping, and enjoy the best of Tasmanian food and produce.
