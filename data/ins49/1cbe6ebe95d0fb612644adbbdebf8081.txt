The Patriots face the NFL's top rushing offense against Browns in Cleveland Sunday.

Analyzing the Patriots' inactives

QB Mac Jones: Jones will miss his third-straight game with a high-ankle sprain. The Patriots are 1-1 without him, but look like they have a new energy under rookie third-stringer Bailey Zappe. The offense has been simpler, there have been much fewer costly turnovers. Jones will likely remain the starter when he returns, but Zappe is pushing him enough to make things interesting.
