Electric vehicles and the energy transition more broadly depend on a host of raw materials beyond the commonly known metals like lithium and copper. Rare earths — a group of 17 metallic elements — are key for EVs, and BMO Capital Markets said miner MP Materials should be on investors' radars given the company's focus on this little known but key market. The firm initiated coverage on the company with an outperform rating on Tuesday, saying the company is a pure-play with high-quality assets at a time when there are few alternatives.
