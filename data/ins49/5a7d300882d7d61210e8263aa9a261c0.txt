Top-eight national seeds Stanford, Texas A&M and East Carolina had easy wins on their home fields in NCAA baseball regional openers Friday. Vanderbilt, which has reached the last two College World Series finals, continued its late-season swoon and will have to fight its way out of the loser's bracket to advance. Tommy Troy hit his third and fourth homers of the season and finished with a career-best four hits and five RBIs in No. 2 Stanford's 20-7 victory over Binghamton. No. 5 Texas A&M scored seven of its runs with two outs in an 8-2 win over Oral Roberts.
