I'm a large man at 7-feet tall and roughly 475+ lbs.

All my life, I've struggled to fit into most vehicles -- regardless if I'm behind a wheel or a passenger.

Between crippling gas prices and the horrific state of the environment, I'd love to own an electric car. Plus, I've always been into tech, and Teslas are the epitome of vehicle technology.

Are there any Tesla models that are suitable for a driver of my stature?
