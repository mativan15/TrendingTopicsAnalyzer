A St. Joseph police officer and his wife were indicted Tuesday on wire fraud charges for allegedly using approximately $99,000 in money from the local police union on personal expenses.

Michael A. Hardin, 46, and Sarah J. Hardin, 42, were collectively charged with seven felonies related to the use of funds from the Fraternal Order of Police over the course of four years, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.

Prosecutors said Michael Hardin, the St. Joseph officer, was the FOP president for about 10 years and his wife, Sarah Hardin, a former Buchanan County Sheriff's Department deputy, was the treasurer.
