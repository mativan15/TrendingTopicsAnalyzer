What to say about Mr Dhawan. Mr Dhawan has a heart of gold, Mr Dhawan never acts Old, Ok I won't do this rhyming, someone else has already trademarked it. But he honestly is one of my favourite people, because he is so easy to get along with, and he is always trying to make sure everyone around him is having a great time, and he is a very Dil Se kind of guy, and even though he's been around for so long, and he knows the way of the industry so well, but he has somehow preserved a sense of innocence, and I think that his approach to acting is very like I want to entertain people, I want to make them laugh, I want to make them have a good time - there is a certain amount of purity in it, which I appreciate.
