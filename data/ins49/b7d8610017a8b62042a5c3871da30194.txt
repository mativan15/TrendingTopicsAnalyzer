The King may only have acceded to the throne six weeks ago but he is already preparing to say farewell to Liz Truss and welcome the second prime minister of his reign.Under-fire Ms Truss – Charles's first PM – took on her role just two days before the death of the Queen, but her premiership has been as disastrous as it was record-breakingly brief.After winning the Conservative Party leadership contest, she travelled to Balmoral in the Scottish Highlands, where the Queen had been staying, on September 6, and was asked to form a government by the 96-year-old monarch.
