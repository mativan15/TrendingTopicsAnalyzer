(AP) - Arizona is a bit of an unknown quantity, with a key returning core surrounded by talented newcomers who hope to make up for the loss of NBA talent. If it sounds familiar, that's just where the No. 17 Wildcats were heading into last season, Tommy Lloyd's first as a head coach. That one turned out pretty well, so no reason to think it won't happen again. Arizona enters its second season under Lloyd with several new players, but it's a mix that's expected to make the former longtime Gonzaga assistant two for two in NCAA Tournament opportunities.
