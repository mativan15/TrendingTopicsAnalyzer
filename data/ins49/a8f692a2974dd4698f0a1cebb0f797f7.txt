We have called Bentonville our home for more than 60 years. A lot has changed over six decades. But what has not changed is keeping our headquarters in our hometown.While many of our associates live and work in the Bentonville area, many others work across the country and around the world. And the Home Office is their home, too.To better serve our associates in the field and other office locations, we knew it was essential to include a hotel on our new campus. From recruiting visits and company gatherings to visiting associates coming to share and learn, having a hotel within campus will enhance each visit.
