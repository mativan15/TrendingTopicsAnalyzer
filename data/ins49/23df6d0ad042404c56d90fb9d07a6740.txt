Indiewire Clea DuVall is looking back on the legacy of the 1999 cult classic film 'But I'm a Cheerleader.'The gay conversion camp rom-com co-starring Natasha Lyonne proved to be a pivotal turn in DuVall's career, but also a 'scary time' for the actress, who was still publicly closeted.'So many opportunities came to me because of [‘But I'm a Cheerleader'] that I didn't take because I was afraid,' DuVall told The Independent while discussing the new '90s-set Freevee via Amazon Prime Video series 'High School,' which she co-wrote and co-directed based on artists Tegan and Sara's novel.
