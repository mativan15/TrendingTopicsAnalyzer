On Oct. 2, days after Hurricane Ian swept through Florida, Rep. Val Demings, a Democrat vying to unseat Sen. Marco Rubio, took to Twitter. 'In the United States Senate, I'll never put partisan politics over delivering disaster relief for Floridians,' she wrote. It was a veiled broadside against Rubio who, in 2012, voted against a $50 billion relief bill for New York and New Jersey after they were decimated by Hurricane Sandy, and last month skipped a vote on $18.
