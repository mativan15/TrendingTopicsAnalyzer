New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has announced that help with energy bills for all households will only last until April. 
He announced a review to look at a ‘new approach' to target support at those worst off after that, aimed at saving taxpayers money.
In a televised briefing today, he said that he and prime minister Liz Truss were committed to helping all households this winter.
‘But beyond that, the Prime Minister and I have agreed it would not be responsible to continue exposing public finances to unlimited volatility in international gas prices,' he said.
