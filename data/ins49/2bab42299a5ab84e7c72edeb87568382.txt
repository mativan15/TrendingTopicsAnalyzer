IntroductionIt's good to be back here at BC, particularly since I couldn't participate in the virtual conference last year. In fact, the last time I was able to participate was in March 2020, right before everything went into lockdown. It's pretty incredible how quickly our lives—work, school, social events —shifted to being online.I can't say I was a fan of shifting from interacting with my staff around a conference table to seeing a fair number of folks show up only on screen, usually from elsewhere in the building.
