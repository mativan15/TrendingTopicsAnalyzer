Arizona-based vehicle maker Nikola Corp. quietly purchased nearly 1,000 acres in the Phoenix metro at the end of September for $16.5 million, according to Maricopa County records.

Nikola (Nasdaq: NKLA) acquired the 920-acre site through Phoenix Hydrogen Hub LLC from Hardison Farms on Sept. 30, real estate database Vizzda shows. George Quinif of Peak Group LLC represented Nikola in the sale.

The massive site is located at 28702 W. Patterson Road in south Buckeye just west of State Route 85 near the Arizona Department of Corrections Lewis Prison, which is one of the largest prisons in the state and houses more than 4,400 inmates.
