Ted Sarandos is once again defending Dave Chapelle, as well as Ricky Gervais' recent controversial comedy special, pointing to Netflix's position on free speech.

In a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times published Saturday spanning everything from bidding wars to his childhood in Arizona, the streamer's co-CEO spoke about the backlash to the comedians' most recent Netflix specials. Both have been criticized by viewers as well as LGBTQ advocacy groups for their content referencing trans people.
