By Reuters Published: 01:05 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 01:05 EDT, 16 October 2022 Jack Colletto rushed for two touchdowns and Oregon State's defense smothered visiting Washington State in the Beavers' 24-10 Pac-12 Conference victory Saturday night in Corvallis, Ore. The Beavers (5-2, 2-2 in Pac-12) had six sacks and held the Cougars to 23 rushing yards. Washington State quarterback Cam Ward (25-for-54 passing, 345 yards) threw incomplete with 6:06 left for a turnover on downs, pressured by the Beavers' pass rush on the play that essentially ended any hope for a Cougars comeback.
