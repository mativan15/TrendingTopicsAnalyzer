(Bloomberg) -- China's key economic data this week will likely show a fragile recovery as stringent Covid policies and a property-market slump continue to batter consumer and business confidence.Official figures on Tuesday are expected to show a mixed picture for the economy in the third quarter. Gross domestic product probably expanded 3.4% from a year earlier, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg, up from near-stagnant growth in the second quarter, when major cities like Shanghai were in lockdown.
