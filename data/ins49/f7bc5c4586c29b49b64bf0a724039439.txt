A friend called recently in a bit of a huff. 'You should write a column,' he said, 'on what more houseguests need to know.'
A widower, my friend lives part time at his second home at the beach, where he has a steady stream of company. Apparently, many people assume that a man alone at a beach house must be in want of guests. He's not.
'I mean doesn't everyone know the three-day rule?' he says, referring to the maxim that after three days, both guests and fish start to stink.
Apparently not, because a couple he knew had just told him they would like to come for a week.
