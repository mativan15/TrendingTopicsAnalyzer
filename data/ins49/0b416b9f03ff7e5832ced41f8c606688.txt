Sergei Chuyko We All Make Mistakes Back in March 2022, I wrote this about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META): ...the company looks damn strong. That's even with the drag from Reality Labs. That's all fine with me, given that a very large percentage of the $10 billion burn is going to hardware, offices, and people. It's not simply evaporating. But, even if it does get completely wasted, FB can "heal" from the sin. Profits are drowning the business in cash. That's good. I was saying back then that $210 looked like a fair deal, even a very fair deal.
