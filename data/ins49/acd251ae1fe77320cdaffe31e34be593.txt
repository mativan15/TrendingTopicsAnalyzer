The UNC basketball program has had one of the best offseasons in college basketball and that comes on the heels of a national runner-up appearance in the NCAA Tournament.

In Hubert Davis' second offseason, a lot of time was spent around his current roster and that work made an impact as the Tar Heels return every key piece to its roster from a season ago that was eligible to return. Outside of Brady Manek, who had exhausted his eligibility, UNC returns its other four starters in Armando Bacot, Caleb Love, Leaky Black and RJ Davis.
