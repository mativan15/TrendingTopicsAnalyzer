A nonstop flight from San Francisco to Oahu, Hawaii generally takes five and a half hours. For Libby Costello '19, the 2,400-mile journey halfway across the Pacific Ocean took a record-breaking 34 days, 14 hours and 11 minutes. Why? She and her three teammates rowed the distance.
Costello, a Bruin rowing and civil engineering alumna of the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering, and her former UCLA teammate Sophia Denison-Johnson were joined by two other elite rowers — Adrienne Smith and Brooke Dowes — in the tremendous rowing feat completed in July of this year.
