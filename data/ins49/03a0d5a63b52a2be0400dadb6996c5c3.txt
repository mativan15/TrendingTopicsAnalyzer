BeyondImages/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images I am reaffirming a positive risk/reward rating for Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) based on its unique portfolio diversification benefits, its leverage to secular growth trends, and its exceptionally asymmetric risk/reward profile. Rio's investment case is bolstered by its top-tier copper growth potential, industry leading aluminum profitability, and arguably the world's highest quality iron ore assets. The downside is reinforced by a nearby technical support base that has developed over the past 13 years, a discounted valuation, a 10% dividend yield, and a structurally bullish supply and demand balance for industrial metals over the coming decade.
