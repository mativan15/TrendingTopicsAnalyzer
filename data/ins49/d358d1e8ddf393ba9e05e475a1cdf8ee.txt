Can you remind me again what a smart meter is?In essence it is a meter that records your energy usage but in a more advanced way than old-school meters. Rather than simply recording how much energy you are using, it constantly feeds it back to the ESB, which means that estimated bills will be a thing of the past if you have one installed.ESB? I thought the company was called Electric Ireland now?Yes and no. Electric Ireland is an energy supplier but it has long since been spun off from the ESB, which once controlled the electricity supply for the whole country.
