With Western Branch and Phoebus still left on its schedule, Oscar Smith could have easily overlooked Nansemond River in what coaches call a trap game.

That's when a team that is heavily favored comes out not thoroughly prepared and focused, and gets beaten while looking ahead to a bigger game.

But the top-ranked Tigers weren't having any of that as they rolled past Nansemond River 28-3 on Senior Night.

'I think this senior group has been in a lot of big-time games and kind of knows and understands what the process is,' said Oscar Smith coach Chris Scott about his group of seniors, who have two state titles under their belt.
