'The short term setup for Nifty IT is to trade back towards 31200-31300 which is roughly where the 200-day average sits in and that would coincide with the Nasdaq running back to 13,000. But that is likely where the rally is expected to stall and resume the downtrend,' says Laurence Balanco, Technical Analyst, CLSA. 
What happens to the Nasdaq? It has come out of a painful period. We are seeing an in-sync move up and so is the case sporadically with Indian IT as well. Purely because of the sentimental ruboff that any crash on Nasdaq has on Indian IT, what do you foresee for not just Indian IT but global IT stocks as well?The longer term conclusion is this is just a relief rally or bear market rally rather than the ultimate low for the Nasdaq.
