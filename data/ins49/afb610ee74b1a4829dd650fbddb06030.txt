Kevin Pietersen has backed England to win the upcoming T20 World Cup but says ‘dark horses' South Africa could do ‘some real damage'.
England begin their T20 World Cup campaign on Saturday against Afghanistan.
They reached the semi-finals of the last tournament in the United Arab Emirates and are aiming to lift the T20 World Cup trophy for the second time.
England go into the competition having beaten Pakistan in a recent T20i series and winning three of their four warm-ups games in Australia – the other was abandoned due to rain.
