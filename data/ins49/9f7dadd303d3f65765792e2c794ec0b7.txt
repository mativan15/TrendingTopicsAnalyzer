On Friday, customers of Unity Credit Union, a financial co-operative based in Hastings, was hit by a scam attack. A post on Unity's website said the company had been subject to a 'BIN attack', and the business was working hard to solve it. A BIN (bank identification number) attack was when a fraudster used computer programmes to steal customer banking details and make fraudulent purchases or transfers. Unity customer Sandra Stiles​ first became aware her account had been hacked when she checked it on Friday morning and saw $1200 had been transferred into a foreign account.
