Steven Gerrard says that he has had 'nothing but support' from the Aston Villa owners and chairman after a difficult start to the season.Pressure has been mounting on the Villa head coach with his side picking up only two wins in their opening ten games and with some supporters calling for Gerrard to be replaced after less than a year in charge at Villa Park.The next two games — against Fulham tonight and Brentford on Sunday — are key, but despite potential replacements being mooted and fan pressure increasing, Gerrard said that he had not had any conversations with the club's owners about his position being under threat.
