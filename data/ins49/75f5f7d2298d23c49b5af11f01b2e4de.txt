Tommy Pham's slap to the face earned him more than a slap on the wrist.
The Reds outfielder has been suspended for three games, Major League Baseball announced, after his bizarre batting-practice altercation Friday in which he slapped Giants outfielder Joc Pederson in the face over a yearlong fantasy football beef. Pham's suspension will include the game he sat out Friday night.
Pham said in Cincinnati on Saturday that Pederson had said 'disrespectful s–t' about the Padres, Pham's former team, and 'f–ked with my money,' according to a tweet by The Athletic reporter C.
