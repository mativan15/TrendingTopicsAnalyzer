Air New Zealand passengers flying to Honolulu, Tahiti or Perth will no longer have the option to purchase just a seat, as the airline is changing its fares to offer a full service on these longer routes. Currently, passengers flying to one of these three destinations have the choice of seat-only, seat and bag, or 'The Works' – which includes seat select, checked baggage, an in-flight meal and drinks, and entertainment. Premium economy and business premier seats are also available to book. But from October 20, economy customers making the five-hour flight from Auckland to Tahiti or the seven-and-a-half hour flight to Perth will only be able to book a seat that includes The Works.
