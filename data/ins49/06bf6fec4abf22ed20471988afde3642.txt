By Alison Main and Chandelis Duster, CNNCNN — Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the lead Democratic negotiator in bipartisan talks on gun control legislation, said Sunday he's "more confident than ever" lawmakers will be able to get something done to address gun violence across the US, while acknowledging he's also concerned their efforts could fail.
"I've never been part of negotiations as serious as these. There are more Republicans at the table talking about changing our gun laws, investing in mental health than at any time since Sandy Hook," Murphy told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union," referencing the mass shooting in 2012 at an elementary school in his home state.
