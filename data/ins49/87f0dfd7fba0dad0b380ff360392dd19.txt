Jun. 03, 2022 11:45 AM ETCORZBy: Pranav Ghumatkar, SA News Editor BTIG analyst Gregory Lewis lowered the firm's price target on Core Scientific (CORZ -11.8%) to $8 from $18 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst dropped stock expectations for the bitcoin miners with bitcoin at $30,000, down 35% year-to-date and 25% below its 2022 average. The mining stocks have collapsed despite bitcoin mining gross margins still sitting around 65% with the cryptocurrency at $30,000. The analyst expects the mining stocks to trade with the bitcoin price but believes the other driver of the miner's underperformance are concerns around funding growth.
