Plans for a controversial redevelopment plan with light industrial business on 61st Avenue in Hobart inched forward Wednesday night, but it's not yet close to a done deal.The Hobart City Council narrowly approved on first reading LaGrange, Illinois-based Becknell Industrial's plan to build warehousing units at 61st and Colorado Street. The vote was 4-3, with Councilmen Mark Kopil, D-1, Lino Maggio, D-3, and Josh Huddlestun, D-2, casting the dissenting votes.In presenting numbers to the skeptical 'No Rezone' crowd, Becknell representative Paul Thurston said that, currently, the 156 acres that Becknell wants generates $6,982 for the city.
