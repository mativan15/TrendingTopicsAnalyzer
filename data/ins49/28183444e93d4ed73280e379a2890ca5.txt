Elon Musk, the world's richest man, said on Twitter Thursday that billionaires aren't the bad guys.
 

 Musk tweeted that it is 'morally wrong & dumb' to use the word billionaire as a pejorative if that person is using their wealth to create products that make 'millions of people happy.'
 

 He added that if he could, he also would get rid of charitable deductions and class-action lawsuits.
 

 Musk was replying to a tweet that said, 'I feel like billionaires are most benign when trying to make money, and most nefarious when spending it trying to 'do good.
