CLEVELAND — The Yankees and Guardians both played to type Saturday night. The Yankees showed their usual might. The Guardians scrapped and scraped, and eventually they prevailed in a last-minute stunner.
The teams demonstrated what they do. The Yankees showed their muscle. The Guardians kept pecking away. Ultimately, for the Yankees it was death by a thousand cuts.
At their best the Yankees can overpower. Meantime, the upstart Guardians will annoy, and they certainly did in Game 3 of the ALDS, stringing one hit after another until the final one ended it in a walk-off win for the home team.
