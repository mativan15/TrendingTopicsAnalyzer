Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) is again laying off employees, offering another sign that the cooling economy is hitting the tech industry.

The Redmond-based company confirmed an Axios report that it's letting go of "under 1,000" employees across multiple teams and organizations.

Microsoft declined to provide details about the cuts.

The company has nearly 3,700 employees in Silicon Valley — making it the region's 29th largest employer — and more than 220,000 companywide. Like other tech giants, Microsoft ramped up hiring significantly during the Covid-19 pandemic.
