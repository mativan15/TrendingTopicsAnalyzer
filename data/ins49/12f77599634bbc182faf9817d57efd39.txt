The move to regulate over-the-top (OTT) communication players such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram is driven by a multifold increase in voice calls over these platforms that are hard to track, creating challenges, including in relation to national security and financial fraud, government officials said. According to a senior Department of Telecommunications (DoT) official, 60-70% of voice calls are currently taking place over these apps. For example, social media major WhatsApp counts India as its largest market, with over 500 million users and accounts for a bulk of the calls made over communication apps, say experts.
