(RTTNews) - European stocks look set to open sharply higher on Tuesday as a dramatic U-turn in British fiscal policy boosted investors' appetite for riskier assets. British Prime Minister Liz Truss has apologized for the tumultuous first few weeks of her leadership, but insisted she is going nowhere and would lead the Conservative Party into the next general election. The U.S. dollar took a breather and bond yields dipped, boosting demand for bullion. Oil prices rose about 1 percent despite reports suggesting that the Biden administration could sell oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve this week in a bid to dampen fuel prices before next month's congressional elections.
