As inflation continues to rise, it's impacting the spending power of consumers across the income spectrum. A new report from PYMNTS.com and LendingClub found that nearly two-thirds of the US population — about 157 million adults — are living paycheck to paycheck. Compared to a year ago, that's up 9 percentage points from 52% in April 2021 to 61% in April 2022.Although the 61% in April is a slight decrease from the 64% of consumers living paycheck to paycheck in March 2022, it's part of an upwards trend of consumers living paycheck to paycheck as the cost of living outpaces wage growth.
