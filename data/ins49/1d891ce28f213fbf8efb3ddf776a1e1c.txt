Formula 1 finds itself in uncharted territory. For the first time, the series is promoting and selling tickets for a Grand Prix.

After a 40-year absence, Las Vegas returns to the calendar in 2023. The Nov. 16 to 18 event will have a unique Saturday night start, at 10, for 50 laps of a 3.8-mile circuit that includes the Strip.

In May, Liberty Media Corporation, which owns Formula 1, spent $240 million on 39 acres to the east of the Strip to build a pit, paddock and hospitality complex.

Although the race has only a three-year contract, Formula 1 shows it means business.
