Local nonprofit Valley Vision has received a $5 million grant from the state to identify economic opportunity in the region.

The nonprofit is one of 13 awardees statewide of grants from California's new Community Economic Resilience Fund, with Valley Vision selected to as fiscal agent and regional coordinator for the area covering Colusa, El Dorado, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, Sutter, Yolo and Yuba counties.

Each of the 13 awardees will lead what is being called a High Road Transition Collaborative, which will bring together a planning group of nonprofit, community and business entities to create an economic development plan, with a focus on jobs that provide a living wage and possibility for upward mobility, and on jobs that promote environmental sustainability.
