It is again that time of the year when people in India gear up to celebrate Diwali. And while preparing for the festival, almost every household undertakes the annual ‘ritual' of cleaning every nook and corner of the home. Usually, the whole family is engaged in the cleaning as Indian mothers want their house to be spotless when they do ‘Lakshmi Puja' on Diwali.
Not surprisingly, netizens on Twitter talked about the feeling of dread with regard to the annual ritual of cleaning before Diwali and posted memes related to the practice.
