A hefty ice chest is a worthwhile consideration for all your year-round outdoor shenanigans, but it's crucial during dehydrating summer weather, especially if you plan on bringing perishables with you. The USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service suggests that bacteria grow most rapidly at 'temperatures between 40 and 140 degrees Farenheit,' and a cooler can keep its stores out of the danger zone. However, standard chests require ice to get the job done, making them pretty high maintenance (not to mention heavy to lug around).
