The Justice Arumughaswamy Commission report, probing the hospitalisation and death of former Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa in September 2016, which was tabled at the Tamil Nadu Assembly on Tuesday, may have ruled out key conspiracy theories, but it damns V.K. Sasikala, Jayalalithaa's close aide who lived with her for almost 30 years, with strong words and a call for further investigations.
Citing a raft of reasons, including unverified media reports, allegations of procedural lapses in the treatment and decisions taken by her doctors, the report castigates Sasikala, her relative Dr.
