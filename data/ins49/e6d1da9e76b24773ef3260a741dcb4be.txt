(Bloomberg) -- Anxious investors are selling out of social media stocks Friday, with the group losing about $35 billion in market value in a broad selloff.First came Snap Inc.'s disappointing results. Shares of the Snapchat parent plunged as much as 28% after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth ever, saying a decline in advertising spending continues to drag on results. It's the latest hit to the stock, which is now down more than 80% this year and trading at its lowest level since February 2019.
