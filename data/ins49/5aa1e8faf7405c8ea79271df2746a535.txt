Many things change in the world, but Elon Musk's tendency to share off-the-cuff thoughts on Twitter does not.

On Thursday evening, Bloomberg reported that people in the federal government were considering reviewing Musk's activities in his various businesses for national security purposes — namely, his plan to buy Twitter and request for funding for Starlink internet service in Ukraine.

Last week, CNN reported that Musk told the Pentagon he no longer wanted to bear the financial brunt of providing internet service in Ukraine.
