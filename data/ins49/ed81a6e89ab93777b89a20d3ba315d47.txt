Cameron Diaz has spoken candidly about ageing and how her perspective on it has changed since becoming a mother. The 49-year-old businesswoman, who shares two-year-old daughter Raddix with her husband Benji Madden, discussed ageing and parenting during a recent interview with Gwyneth Patltrow's lifestyle brand, Goop. According to Diaz, having a toddler has 'changed [her] completely,' as she's now even more 'excited' for the years to come and hopes to be alive until she's '110'.'The whole concept of ageing has just changed completely, even in the last 10 years,' she explained.
