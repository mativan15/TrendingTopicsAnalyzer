Eatonville Mayor Angie Gardner said the opening of a new credit union in the town is a "big step" for the community, which is known for being the oldest Black-incorporated municipality in the nation.

Unity of Eatonville Federal Credit Union debuted its main location Oct. 20 at 323 E. Kennedy Blvd. The credit union is the first financial institution of any type based in the town.

Why this matters: Financial institutions are often key for businesses, both for deposits and for loans.

"If you want sustainability, you have to have economic stability," Gardner said.
