The biggest union representing public service workers in British Columbia has ratified a new collective agreement with the provincial government that includes wage protection against inflation. The B.C. Government Employees' Union says 53.4 per cent of eligible members who cast ballots voted to ratify the deal that followed two weeks of strikes and eight months of negotiating. The union has more than 30,000 members including people working in social services, environmental management, corrections and liquor stores.
