Fishmonger Steve Waters from the Midlands made an impassionate plea for Boris Johnson to retake his seat in 10 Downing Street. Mr Waters assured all the businessmen he has spoken to - without exception - want Mr Johnson back in his role as Prime Minister. He added the former Prime Minister is the only Conservative candidate who can really bring the country's economy back on track.Mr Waters told BBC Breakfast: "He's the one man who can turn it around for the Conservative Party."And you can look the constituents and the Opposition in the eye and say, 'That man has a mandate'.
