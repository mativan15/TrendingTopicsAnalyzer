For most investors who own shares of Genius Brands International (GNUS 5.66%), holding the stock has been a punishing experience. It's down 36% year to date to just $0.70 a share -- making it a penny stock. Unfortunately, the company's underperformance doesn't look set to change despite a recent licensing deal with Walt Disney's Marvel Studios.
