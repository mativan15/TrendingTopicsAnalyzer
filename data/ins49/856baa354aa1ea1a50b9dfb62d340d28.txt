PHILADELPHIA -- Trailing two games to one in the National League Championship Series, the Padres will turn to right-hander Mike Clevinger for Game 4 on Saturday night in Philadelphia. But for how long, exactly?
'I'm going to go until Bob comes and tells me I can't go anymore,' Clevinger said.
And therein lies the most critical of questions for Padres manager Bob Melvin. Clevinger has struggled lately, having posted a 6.52 ERA over his final six starts of the regular season. Then he allowed five runs (four earned) over 2 2/3 innings in Game 1 of the NLDS at Dodger Stadium.
