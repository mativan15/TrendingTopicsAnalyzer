Virat Kohli may no longer be the captain, he is no longer the most prolific scorer, but there is no doubting the support the ace batter has among cricket fans in India and across the world. It was evident when the International Cricket Council (ICC) shared a video featuring some of the stars of the Indian team as build-up to the match with Pakistan on October 23 at the ICC T20 World Cup 2022.

The video featured captain Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, Suryakumar Yadav, and Yuzvendra Chahal, all raising their hand to the emblem on their chest - but no Virat Kohli.
