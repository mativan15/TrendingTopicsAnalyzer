Prime Minister Liz Truss has just announced she will stand down as Prime Minister after she told Parliament yesterday she was 'committed' to bringing back the triple lock mechanism, which was suspended last year. The triple lock policy guarantees the state pension increases each year in line with inflation, average earnings or 2.5 percent, whichever is highest.With inflation hitting 10.1 percent in the year to September 2022 and with this being the figure used for the triple lock, pensioners are set for a major boost from next April.
