Just Stop Oil activists have shut the Dartford Bridge by climbing onto cables high above the road linking Essex and Kent.
Essex Police confirmed the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge at the Crossing was closed to traffic after being told about the incident shortly before 3.50am.
At least two climbers can be seen on the bridge in stunning pictures, while there are already significant delays for motorists.
The climate group appear to have identified them as bridge designer Morgan Trowland, 39, and teacher ‘Marcus', 33, who is also from London.
