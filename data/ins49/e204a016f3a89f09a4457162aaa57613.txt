The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education's board on Thursday asked the commonwealth for more money, enabling it to freeze undergraduate tuition for a fifth straight year and to educate students preparing for careers in fields with significant labor shortages.

PASSHE requested $573.5 million to keep tuition at the same rate amid rising inflation.

It also asked, separately, for $112 million earmarked for financial aid for students specializing in health care, education, engineering, social work and computer science, with the aim of addressing the talent shortage and strengthening the state's workforce.
