Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday upped the ante on the Aam Aadmi Party in the national capital as people gear up for the municipal elections. Attacking the CM Arvind Kejriwal-led party, Shah asked the people to choose between ‘AAP nirbhar' (dependent on the AAP) or ‘Aatmanirbhar' (self-reliant) and blamed the ruling government for treating municipal corporations with a 'second-class behaviour' by withholding funds worth ₹40,000 crore to render them dysfunctional. Shah, who was inaugurating a waste to energy plant near Tughlaqabad, said that AAP thinks the people of Delhi will turn against municipal corporations of Delhi (MCD) due to lack of funds but the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party will carry a door-to-door campaign to highlight the treatment meted out by the Delhi chief minister towards MCD.
