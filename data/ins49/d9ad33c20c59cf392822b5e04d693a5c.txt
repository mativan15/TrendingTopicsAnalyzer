Saquon Barkley said his right shoulder injury won't limit him Sunday against the Jaguars. He was upgraded to a full practice participant on Friday and off the injury report.

'It's annoying, but it's not something that's going to stop me from going out there and being able to produce,' Barkley said Thursday in the Giants' locker room.

The Giants (5-1) hope Barkley is right as they travel to Jacksonville (2-4).

A hit on his shoulder late in last week's win over the Ravens 'woke … up' an injury he initially had sustained against the Green Bay Packers in London.
