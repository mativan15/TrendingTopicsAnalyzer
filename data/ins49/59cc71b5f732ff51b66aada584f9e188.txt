The return of Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa should help lift an offense that has struggled in his absence. The third-year quarterback's accuracy, ball placement and timing in coach Mike McDaniel's scheme gave Miami one of the NFL's most efficient offenses before a concussion sidelined him for the better part of three games.

However, Tagovailoa can only do so much for a porous offensive line that has struggled to pass protect in recent weeks. Injuries have played a role in the unit's problems.
