The expansion of the UK's manufacturing sector slowed to a seven-month low as inflation ate into household spending and exports dropped in part due to Brexit.According to an influential survey, the sector struggled to keep up its growth in May.Businesses blamed weaker growth in demand from within the UK, fewer export orders, troubled supply chains, rising costs and the war in Ukraine.As a result the S&P Global/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) hit 54.6 in May, down from 55.8 in April.
