Westford, USA, Oct. 18, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- With ever-growing patient populations and advances in medical technology, the pharmaceuticals market is expected to grow at a moderate pace through 2028. However, growth is not uniform across all segments of the industry--in fact, new product launches and blockbuster drug approvals are more common in the blockbuster drugs category than anywhere else.
