June 02, 2022 02:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--IG Design Group plc ('Design Group' or the 'Company') is pleased to announce that the Company has extended the term of its existing banking agreement to 31 March 2024. The agreement was signed after market close on 1 June 2022.



As part of this extension, covenants have been revised for the period to 31 March 2023 and the facility size has been amended as follows:


RCF A has reduced from $95 million to $90 million


RCF B has reduced from a maximum level of £130 million to a maximum of £92 million


The Directors believe these amendments continue to give the Group more than sufficient headroom to fund its seasonal working capital requirements over the remaining term of the banking agreement.
