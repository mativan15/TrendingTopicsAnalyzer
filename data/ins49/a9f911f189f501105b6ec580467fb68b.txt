Overheard before Friday's football game at St. Michael-Albertville, a Knights student fan telling his buddy how he chose cold-weather apparel over something more fashionable.

Visiting Maple Grove also found dressing for success called for more grit, less glamour. The Crimson, ranked first in Class 6A and in the Metro Top 10, remained undefeated with a 30-0 victory. When his passes failed to connect, senior quarterback Jacob Kilzer put his feet down.

He built a 20-0 halftime lead for the Crimson (7-0).
