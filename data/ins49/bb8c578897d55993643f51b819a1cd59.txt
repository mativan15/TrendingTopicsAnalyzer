While the action was on the field Thursday night as the Arizona Cardinals took on the New Orleans Saints, some TV viewers were more interested in the trailer of Taylor Swift's new album, released during the game. Swift's album "Midnights" debuted at midnight on Friday, soon after the trailer came out during "Thursday Night Football." The trailer was a succession of clips from the music videos Swift shot for the album, which showed her playing a range of roles from different periods of history, including a Marilyn Monroe-type actress, a flapper girl, Marie Antoinette and, at one point, a person who hides in a coffin for some reason.
