Jeremy Hunt will make an emergency statement today as he sets out billions of pounds of savings to stabilise the public finances as the new Chancellor further shreds Liz Truss's mini-Budget.

The Treasury said the move – following talks over the weekend between Mr Hunt and the Prime Minister – was designed to 'ensure sustainable public finances underpin economic growth'.

Following his statement this morning, the Chancellor will address the House of Commons this afternoon ahead of the publication of his full medium term fiscal plan on October 31.
