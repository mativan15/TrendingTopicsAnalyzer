Among the closest aides of Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal, Jain, the AAP MLA from Shakur Basti, was part of the anti-corruption movement headed by Anna Hazare in 2011. He joined Kejriwal when the AAP was formed a year later.
The Central Bureau of Investigation had opened an investigation against Jain in 2018 with regard to alleged irregularities in awarding a tender for a creative team for the Public Works Department to a private firm.https://images.indianexpress.
