LUCKNOW: A day after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s Kaiserganj MP Brij Bhusan Sharan Singh censured his own government saying that the people affected by floods in the state have been left " Bhagwan Bharose (At the mercy of God)" and that he has never seen such poor preparation for flood control, the saffron party on Sunday distanced itself from the lawmaker's remark terming it a "self-centred" stance to meet "certain political goals".A top BJP office-bearer said that Singh had of late been making comments which have not gone down well with the party brass.
