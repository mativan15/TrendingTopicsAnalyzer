On Thursday, Rishi Sunak spent an enormous amount of money. Once you add together the £400 subtracted from every consumer energy bill, the extra support for pensioners and those on benefits, and the welfare increases promised next year, you end up with a larger amount than was pledged in the entire 2019 Conservative manifesto. In other words, the chancellor spent more on cost of living in a single afternoon than his party once promised to spend over five years on everything.But, to look at it another way, Sunak didn't spend nearly enough.
