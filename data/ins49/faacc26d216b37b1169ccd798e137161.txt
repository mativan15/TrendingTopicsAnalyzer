God save the Queen — again. 
The Sex Pistols have re-released their banned hit 'God Save the Queen' ahead of Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee celebration. 
A new music video was cut using footage from the performance video shot by Julien Temple at the marquee in May 1977 and clips of the Thames riverboat party on the Silver Jubilee day in June that same year. 
It also features exclusive footage of some of the earliest, most important and influential female fans of the band including Vivienne, Jordan, Debbie and Tracey, Catwoman and Helen of Troy.
