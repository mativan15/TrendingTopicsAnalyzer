Plenty of magic and mystery went into the making of iconic fantasy series Harry Potter, as well as some slightly strange methods to keep the wonder alive, according to Tom Felton.
Across eight films, based on the novels by JK Rowling, fans have been treated to wondrous spells, floating dementors, epic battle scenes, and creatures great and small on the big screen.
Created through practical and special effects, many times the (often young) cast would have to act alongside blank spaces that would later be filled by something magical, using prompts to aid the realism of the scene.
