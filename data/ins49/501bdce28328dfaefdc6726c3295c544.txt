There isn't much that has been at PepsiCo longer than Derek Lewis, but one thing that has is diversity. Lewis knows this first-hand because it's a significant part of his job.

Today, Lewis is the president of PepsiCo's Multicultural Business and Equity Development. During his 34 years with Pepsi, he's had so many positions that it can be challenging for him to keep them straight.

'From the very beginning, diversity has been a core value of PepsiCo, and our dedication to diversity efforts has paved the way for the creation of our newly established business unit to go even further to continue to bring change to our communities and employees,' Lewis told BLACK ENTERPRISE.
