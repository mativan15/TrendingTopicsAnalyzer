Luis Alvarez/DigitalVision via Getty Images I covered Anavex Life Sciences Corp. (NASDAQ:AVXL) a few times before. AVXL is an interesting stock, made more so by the tremendous vocal following it has from both bulls and bears. Its lead candidate ANAVEX®2-73 (BLARCAMESINE) targets a number of CNS indications like Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Rett Syndrome and so on. The company has a market cap of $750mn and a cash balance of $153mn. Research and development expenses were $8.6 million while general and administrative expenses were $2.
