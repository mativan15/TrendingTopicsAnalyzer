The Delhi High Court was informed on Tuesday that the Amarnathji Shrine Board has decided to do sale of tickets of helicopter services from Jammu and Kashmir online for the yatra. A bench of Acting Chief Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Sachin Datta disposed of a plea seeking direction to the board to adopt online system for booking and sale of tickets of helicopter services from Jammu and Kashmir, especially for old, ailing and disabled pilgrims, for the yatra. The bench disposed of the plea after the petitioner organisation Indian Council of Legal Aid's general secretary and advocate R K Saini submitted that it has no grievance with the system put in place and now nothing survives in the petition.
