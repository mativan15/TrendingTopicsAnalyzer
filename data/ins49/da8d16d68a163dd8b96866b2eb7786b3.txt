Solar panels and air heaters that generate clean energy to run auto sprayer driers at Overseas Leathers, a leather manufacturing company in SIPCOT in Ranipet on Wednesday. 
After much hesitation, tanneries in the Ranipet-Ambur-Vaniyambadi region have started taking baby steps to tap into solar energy to run automatic sprayer driers, vital for drying the processed leather, in their factories to cut down on the bi-monthly power bills. A group of tannery owners came together at Overseas Leathers, a manufacturer and exporter of finished leathers, in the SIPCOT Complex in Ranipet on Wednesday to have a first hand experience of the operation of solar air heaters at tanneries.
