Britney Spears has voiced her support for protesters in Iran fighting for women's rights.

'Me & my husband stand with the people of Iran fighting for freedom,' she tweeted on Sunday.

The pop star's husband, Iranian-American model Sam Asghari, has been speaking out about the deadly demonstrations since last month, when Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman, died in the custody of morality police in Tehran. Amini was arrested for improperly wearing her hijab. According to witnesses, she was beaten severely by police upon her arrest.
