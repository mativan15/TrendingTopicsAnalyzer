Mark Kennedy had a grip of Danny Mandroiu and was dragging him with purpose from the centre circle. Don't worry, this was not some spiky training ground confrontation, this was the magnet version of Mandroiu and he was being moved across the white tactics board in Kennedy's tidy office at Lincoln City.Not for the first time on Thursday afternoon, Kennedy was animated. He was on his feet illustrating a phrase from a Turkish coach on his pro licence course: 'I'm comfortable being uncomfortable.'The phrase struck Kennedy then, it has stuck and it is a way of explaining why Kennedy, this man who has declined interview requests for a decade and more (including, initially, this one), who refuses to use social media, who plays golf on his own (off 4), who wants to live his life under the radar, is talking for two hours about where he is, who he is, what has been and what is to come.
