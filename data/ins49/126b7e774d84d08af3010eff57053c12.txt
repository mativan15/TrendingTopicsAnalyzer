Gregory Klaus defeated Donald Loucks for the GOP nomination for Bastrop County judge in a runoff contest Tuesday, according to the election results.

'I was really happy I won because I feel like I can do a really good job whenever I do get in there. So, I was real happy I won,' Klaus told the Advertiser on Wednesday.
