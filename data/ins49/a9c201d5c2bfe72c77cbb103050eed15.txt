The Winnipeg Police Service has seen an increase in sextortion scheme reports over the past year. Police explained that this scheme involves a perpetrator using a fake account to solicit a victim on social media. Officers said the schemer may operate outside of Canada and 'catfish' the victim by pretending to be an enticing individual who is young and attractive or who has similar interests. From there, the perpetrator will create an online relationship based on false trust and emotion. Police note that as the relationship progresses, the victim is encouraged to share intimate images.
