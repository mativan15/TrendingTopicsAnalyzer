Ryan Fletcher The market hasn't liked the airlines for years, if not decades. United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) just reported a quarter with blowout margins, yet the airline trades like the sector is still being hit by covid lockdowns. My investment thesis remains ultra-Bullish on the airline sector, especially the turnaround occurring with United Airlines while the stock trades near the lows. Source: FINVIZ Booming Business With Constraints United Airlines just reported a quarter with all-time record revenues despite capacity down nearly 10% from 2019 levels.
