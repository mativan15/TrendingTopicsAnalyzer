It's remarkable how real estate bubbles always seem to burst in the same places: big city suburbs, abandoned farmlands and empty lots where rows of empty concrete shells rise above roads closed to traffic and cheerful billboards touting middle-class dreams. 'Central Mansion,' announces one such billboard in a residential development about 30 miles (50 kilometers) from downtown Beijing. Unfinished projects stretch in every direction, including a cluster of apartment buildings owned by Evergrande, a Chinese developer that has the distinction of being the most indebted real estate company in the world, and that has now become the poster child for China's deflated real estate sector.
