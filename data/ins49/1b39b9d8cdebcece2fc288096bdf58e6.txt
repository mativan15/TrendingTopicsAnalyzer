Delhivery's muted guidance pushed shares 15.6% lower on Thursday after it said high inflation would dent consumer spending and result in moderate growth in shipments for the rest of the financial year. 
Shares closed at Rs 471.30 on the BSE Thursday, the first time they have fallen below the issue price of Rs 487. Delhivery listed on the stock exchanges in May.

'While the festive season sale surge in shipment volumes will spill over to the third quarter as well, we anticipate moderate growth in shipment volumes through the rest of the financial year,' the e-commerce focussed logistics company said in a filing to the BSE late on Wednesday.
