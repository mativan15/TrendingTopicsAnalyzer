Chennai: Nasdaq-listed Freshworks Inc has offered CEO Girish Mathrubootham a multi-year stock award that would have nine million shares enter his disposal in phases, conditioned upon his continued service at the top position and the stock's averaging at specific target prices through the vesting period, according an SEC filing in April. The Freshworks board had okayed the award in a pre-IPO decision in September last year, with a third of the nine million share award routed as Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) that began vesting with him beginning November last year.
