Hedge-fund billionaire Ken Griffin has upped his investment in Republican governor candidate Richard Irvin to $50 million, with an additional $5 million contribution reported Tuesday.

The latest infusion of cash to Irvin came shortly after Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker launched an attack ad late last week contending that Griffin's support for Irvin was the result of Irvin's actions as mayor of Aurora to push through a project important to the hedge-fund investor's high-frequency trading business, Citadel Securities.
