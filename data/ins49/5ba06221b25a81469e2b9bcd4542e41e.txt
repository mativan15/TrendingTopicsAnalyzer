Kanye West could be facing legal action over his comments about the death of George Floyd. 
The 45-year-old rapper is in a storm of backlash after making a series of controversial statements in recent weeks, including branding Black Lives Matter a ‘scam', being accused of bullying a Vogue contributing editor on social media and having his accounts on Instagram and Twitter locked over alleged anti-semitic comments. 
Over the weekend, West appeared on the podcast Drink Champs where he made further eyebrow-raising remarks and discussed the murder of Floyd, a Black man who died in 2020 when Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd‘s neck despite pleas that he was struggling to breathe.
