Veteran Iraqi politician Mohammad Shia' al-Sudani has been named as the country's new prime minister, bringing to a close a year of political paralysis following the October 2021 election and giving an Iranian-backed coalition of Shiite parties a win over its fellow Shiite rivals.

In a peaceful session, the members of the Iraqi parliament, the Council of Representatives, appointed Abdul Latif Rashid as the new president, who in turn tapped al-Sudani as prime minister.

The Coordination Framework

Al-Sudani, who now has a month to form a government, had been nominated by the coalition of Shiite parties known as the Coordination Framework.
