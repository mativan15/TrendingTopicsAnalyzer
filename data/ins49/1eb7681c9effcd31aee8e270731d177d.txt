The English Football League's decision to consider ending the traditional 3pm TV blackout for Saturday games has led to fierce debate among fans.

CUOSC decided to sound out the views of our own supporters by running a snap poll on Twitter.

Nearly 500 people voted and the result perhaps summed up the EFL's predicament. It was an even split with 44 per cent in favour of the blackout, 43 per cent against and 13 per cent undecided.
