Tensions between Seoul and Pyongyang are high, with North Korea firing missiles, conducting air exercises, and reportedly preparing its first nuclear test since 2017. At the same time, Seoul is preparing what could be seen as an olive branch for the North's regime — the South Korean government aims to revise a law that dates back to 1948 and bans the dissemination of North Korean media in the South.
