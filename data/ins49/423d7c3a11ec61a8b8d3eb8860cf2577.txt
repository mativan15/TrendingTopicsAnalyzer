Donald Trump posted about the need for 'real solutions and real leadership' on Wednesday in response to the school mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, and he'll likely make a similar call on Friday, when he travels to Houston to address the National Rifle Association. But when there was another mass shooting at a school during his presidency, he offered no new solutions and, according to a person present, was mentally absent at a critical moment for addressing the gun violence crisis.
As Trump's team was preparing him in late 2018 to meet with the families of murdered children from Parkland, Florida, the president, according to the individual present, was more concerned about his border wall, a desire to 'stick it to the Mexicans,' and an unflattering headline on the conservative news site, Drudge Report.
