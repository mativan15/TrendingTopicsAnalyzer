Grandbrothers The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted fast track designation to Mereo BioPharma alvelestat (MPH-966) to treat Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)-associated lung disease. The London-based company said it plans to have an end-of-phase 2 meeting with the FDA to discuss the design of a registration-enabling study for alvelestat for AATD-associated lung disease, including a potential opportunity for an accelerated approval pathway. AATD is a genetic disorder characterized by low levels of a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT).
