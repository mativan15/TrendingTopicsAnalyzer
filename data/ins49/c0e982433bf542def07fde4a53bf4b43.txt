Meta Platforms (FB -2.58%) disclosed late Wednesday that longtime executive Sheryl Sandberg plans to resign from her role as chief operating officer. Although the stock price's move downward of roughly 2.5% might not have seemed like a big reaction, news of Sandberg's imminent departure sent shockwaves across the investing community.
Often, major leadership changes become catalysts for strategic change at a company, with significant implications for shareholders. With Meta's stock already having lost more than half its value in just nine months, though, investors could reasonably see the social media giant as a buy even if they don't see Sandberg's departure as a positive.
