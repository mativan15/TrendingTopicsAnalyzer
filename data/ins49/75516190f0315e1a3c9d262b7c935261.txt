By Michael Susin Alpha FX Group PLC said Friday that profit for the full year is expected to be materially ahead of expectations driven by higher income from interest rates, and that revenue growth is consistent. The provider of foreign-exchange risk management solutions said the profit boost is due to the interest-rate environment generating additional income from its alternative banking business' overnight cash balances. Pretax profit for 2022 is expected to come in at 38.3 million pounds ($43 million), according to Liberum's analyst Ciaran Donnelly estimation taken from FactSet.
