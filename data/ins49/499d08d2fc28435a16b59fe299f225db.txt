Apple's WWDC 2022 kicks off today, with Apple CEO Tim Cook's eagerly-anticipated keynote, at 10AM PDT / 6PM GMT.It's an exciting moment in Apple history for many reasons. This is Apple's first partially in-person World Wide Developers Conference since 2019. While the majority of people will watch the event and attend sessions virtually, a small group of developers, analysts, and media (including our own Lance Ulanoff and Matt Hanson) will be in attendance at Apple Park in Cupertino, California.As for the keynote and two-day conference, it will be packed to the gills (maybe more so than ever) with platform update announcements and surprises.
