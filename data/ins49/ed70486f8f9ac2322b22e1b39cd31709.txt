Until May, Jihyun Park's native North Korea had declared itself a Covid-free zone: the hermit state apparently untouched by two years of a global pandemic. Now, it has admitted to 2.8 million cases of Omicron and 68 deaths – a number that is likely a fiction of understatement says Park, who, after escaping the country twice, last year ran as a Conservative councillor in north west England and is now a human rights activist. 'North Korea is never telling the truth about Covid,' she says. These news alerts are the only way the 52-year-old can find out what's happening in her secretive home country – a country she can never visit again.
