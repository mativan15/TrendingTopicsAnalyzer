Migrants on lower pay still can't bring their parents to Aotearoa in a move labelled 'hurtful' by a union for migrant workers. A raft of changes to immigration settings were unveiled last week, including a lower salary threshold for migrants wanting to bring their parents over. A sponsor now needs to earn 1.5 times the median wage or $86,611 for one parent, instead of the previous two times the median wage. The new threshold increases by half the median wage for each additional parent. If there are two sponsors, they need to have a combined income that is twice the median wage or $115,481.
