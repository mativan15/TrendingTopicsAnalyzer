SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you so much. First of all, I'm so glad that you were able to get class outside today, and I'm really happy to participate in that. We're here in part to ask you to think about the possibility of public service and including the possibility of service in the State Department. And I know that that may not be the first thing that comes to mind as you're thinking about what to do when you're at Stanford or at some point later in your career, but I'd like to just take a moment (inaudible) suggest why actually this would be an extraordinary time to think about not just (inaudible) some kind of public service but actually coming to the State Department and working on what America is doing around the world.
