Jun. 1—QUINCY — Asphalt removal should begin sometime within the next couple of weeks on three blocks of B Street Northeast in Quincy.

"A complete new road," said Shawn Pierce, project supervisor for Hurst Construction LLC.

B Street Northeast is one of two street improvement projects underway in Quincy this summer, and a third is nearing completion. Six blocks of B Street Northeast, between Central Avenue North and Sixth Avenue Northeast, are getting a rebuild.

Hurst, an East Wenatchee company, is the contractor for the $3.
