The gang was transported to the Black Hills during a Halloween special that parodied none other than The Blair Witch Project.
The hit horror film was released in 1999, horrifying viewers and reigniting the found footage genre.
Due to its popularity, Cartoon Network decided to pay homage to the cultural phenomenon in a truly bizarre episode that many fans seem to have suppressed in their memory.
