The government's announcement was expected. Macron's centrist alliance lost its parliamentary majority in June, making it much more difficult for his government to get laws passed the conventional way in the lower house of parliament.

Faced with multiple budget amendments from the opposition, government officials had warned they were ready to invoke the French Constitution's Article 49.3, which allows the prime minister to bypass parliament in some situations, including votes on budget bills.

If the prime minister is successful, the budget bill would go to the Senate.
