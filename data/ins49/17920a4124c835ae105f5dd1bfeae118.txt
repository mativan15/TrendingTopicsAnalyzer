One of China's most senior UK diplomats was involved in violence against protesters at the Manchester consulate on Sunday, a British MP says.

"What we saw was the Chinese consul-general then ripping down posters and peaceful protest," Alicia Kearns told MPs in the House of Commons.

MPs in Parliament have privilege, allowing them to speak freely without fear of legal action.

China has not commented on Zheng Xiyuan's alleged involvement.

But the foreign ministry in Beijing defended the actions of consulate staff.
