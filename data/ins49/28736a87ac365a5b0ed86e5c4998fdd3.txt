Stranger Thingsactor David Harbour has revealed he was institutionalised for his bipolar disorder when he was in his mid-twenties.

'I was diagnosed at 26 as bipolar after an episode that landed me in an institution,' the actor explained.

'I have been struggling with the medical model of mental illness for a long time. I started to really get into talk therapy around the particular trauma, and I find that narrative and stories, dealing intellectually and emotionally with personal trauma, has been far more liberating to me than hospitals and drugs.
