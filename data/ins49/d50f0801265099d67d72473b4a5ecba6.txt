Former Florida Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, a longtime education policy advocate, called on Americans to take seriously the decline in competency among recent grade school graduates.The former 2016 presidential candidate also responded to political rival Donald Trump's criticisms of his father, which the real estate mogul lodged amid the appointment of a special master to pore over potentially classified materials from the Mar-a-Lago raid.Bush noted the National Assessment of Educational Progress is due out, and that it will likely show "a horrible situation of decreases in learning," particularly among students from low-income families.
