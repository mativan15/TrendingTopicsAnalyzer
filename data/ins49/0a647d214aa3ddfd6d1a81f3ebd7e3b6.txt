By Reuters Published: 20:29 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 20:29 EDT, 18 October 2022 South Carolina is seeking its first four-game winning streak since 2013 while Texas A&M will try to halt a two-game losing skid when they meet Saturday night in a Southeastern Conference matchup in Columbia, S.C. The Gamecocks (4-2, 1-2 SEC) beat Kentucky 24-14 on the road in their last outing while the Aggies (3-3, 1-2) lost 24-20 at Alabama when Haynes King's pass into the end zone on their final play fell incomplete.
