EDMONTON, Alberta -- — Eric Comrie made 46 saves to help the Buffalo Sabres beat the Edmonton Oilers 4-2 on Tuesday night. The 27-year-old goalie, whose brother Mike played for the Oilers from 2000-03, relished playing in goal in his hometown. 'It was great, but it's just two points and it doesn't matter who we're playing against and what's going on whether my family is in town,' Comrie said. 'I'm just going out there with this group of guys and giving it all I have for this group, no matter where it is or when it is.
