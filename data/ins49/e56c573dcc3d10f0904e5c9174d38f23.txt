Patriots quarterback Mac Jones is reportedly expecting to be available for Monday night's game against the Bears.

But to this point, the QB still has not been a full participant in practice as he continues to recover from his high-ankle sprain.

Jones was once again a limited participant in practice, according to New England's Friday injury report.

Head coach Bill Belichick once again said they're taking the situation with Jones 'day-by-day' in his Friday press conference.
