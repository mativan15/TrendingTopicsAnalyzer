Outgoing Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby is asking the judge presiding over her federal perjury and mortgage fraud case to move her upcoming trial out of the city.

Mosby's attorneys filed a document under seal Thursday, and U.S. District Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby issued a scheduling order Friday asking both parties to file responses about whether the trial should be moved. It is scheduled to take place in March.

Previously, Mosby's attorneys had argued that many of the potential jurors in her case were prejudiced against her because of prosecutors' actions and local media coverage.
