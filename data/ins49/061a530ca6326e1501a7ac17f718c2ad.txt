The investing arm of the Canada Pension Plan is sticking by its decision not to sell off assets tied to fossil fuels, even as a growing number of other large pension managers and institutional investors say they will.With $539-billion in net assets, CPP Investments wields huge influence over the financial landscape in Canada and around the world. In February, it made a big commitment to cutting carbon from its portfolio, pledging to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.But the fund (which manages the Canada Pension Plan money that is not needed to pay immediate benefits to beneficiaries) said it would not take a 'blanket divestment' approach as part of its climate change policy and CEO John Graham defended that position this week in a meeting with the Toronto Star's editorial board.
