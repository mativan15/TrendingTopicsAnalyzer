The former boss of Morses Club, who left the doorstep lender amid a share-dealing controversy, has quit his role with an industry body linked to the City regulator.Paul Smith's membership of the Financial Conduct Authority's Smaller Business Practitioner Panel was potentially awkward because of the circumstances of his exit from Morses.He left abruptly in February on the day Morses issued a profit warning that sent its shares down by almost two thirds. The company disclosed at that time that Smith, 55, had sold almost £200,000 of Morses' stock days earlier.
