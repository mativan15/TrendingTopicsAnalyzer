Intel Arc Alchemist, also known as Intel's first serious venture into discrete graphics for gamers, is finally here. While the GPUs can't hope to compete with some of AMD's and Nvidia's best graphics cards, they can stand their own ground in the midrange market, and they're priced very competitively to make up for the fact that they won't replace your new RTX 4090 or even your old RTX 3080. Intel's lineup right now includes the flagship Arc A770, which is supposed to be available with either 8GB or 16GB memory.
