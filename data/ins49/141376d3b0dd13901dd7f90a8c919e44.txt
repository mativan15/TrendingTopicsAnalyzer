While common repairs include cracked screens, battery issues, and water damage, the company's repair experts have fixed millions of devices and can help with most any tech mishap, and many basic repairs can be completed in two hours or less.

The store is owned by Angelo Giannakopoulos and Timothy Moorehead, who also own six additional stores across North and South Carolina.
"We saw the need for an affordable tech repair provider in Fayetteville, so I'm excited for Asurion Tech Repair & Solutions to fill that gap," said Giannakopoulos.
