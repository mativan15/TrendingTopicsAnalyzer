The show is expected to go on for Discovery's Deadliest Catch, despite the decision by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game last week to cancel the winter snow crab season due to the dwindling population.

In a statement provided to Deadline, Deadliest Catch Executive Producer Arom Starr-Paul said this about the 19th season that will kick off in the spring of 2023: 'Fans can anticipate another great season of Deadliest Catch where we will document our captains as they participate in other sustainable Bering Sea crab and pot fisheries, such as Golden King Crab, Bairdi and Cod.
