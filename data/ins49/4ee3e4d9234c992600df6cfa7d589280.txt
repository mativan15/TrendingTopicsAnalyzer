There's nothing like a fresh coat of paint to liven up your living room, beautify your bedroom or upgrade your utility; but often, the biggest problem is choosing the right colour. This may seem like a simple task but can cause even the most even-tempered among us to reach boiling point over the ideal hue for the hallway.Help is at hand, however, at the Permanent TSB Ideal Home Show, which this autumn features a Dulux Heritage Interior Design Hub.Running from Friday, 21st to Sunday, October 23rd, at the RDS, the show will showcase a new collection of 112 luxurious colours, while Dulux Heritage colour consultants will be on hand to discuss options, and help homeowners to decide what shade will work best for their homes.
