halbergman/E+ via Getty Images General Electric (NYSE:GE) was said to planning to cut back on office space in Boston and other corporate locations as the industrial conglomerate gets ready to split into three businesses. The company last week filed registration paperwork for shares of its GE Healthcare spinoff, which will trade as a separate company next year. GE plans to combine its power and renewable energy units into a second company called Vernova that will be spun off in 2024. The remaining GE will specialize in aviation.
