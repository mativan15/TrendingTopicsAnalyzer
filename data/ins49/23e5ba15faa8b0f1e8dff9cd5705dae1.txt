The Small Business Administration has purchased about 127,000 nonperforming Paycheck Protection Program loans from lenders as of Oct. 17.

That means the total number of nonperforming PPP loans has more than doubled since mid July, when the agency said it had purchased about 64,000 PPP loans for a total of about $3.3 billion, an average of $51,562 per loan. That's up from the 35,450 delinquent PPP loans the agency had purchased from lenders as of Feb. 17, 2022, according to agency.

Overall, that is still a small percentage of the 10.
