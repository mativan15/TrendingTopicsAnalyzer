Benchmark indices opened higher on Wednesday but soon reversed gains as concerns over rising inflation globally dented investor sentiment but losses remained capped. Data showed eurozone inflation hit a record high in May, owing to surging energy costs. In a meeting overnight, US president Joe Biden vowed to give Fed Chair Powell 'space' to fight inflation. Domestic investors took heart from comments from Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran, who ruled out risk of stagflation for India, saying the economy is better placed than other nations.
