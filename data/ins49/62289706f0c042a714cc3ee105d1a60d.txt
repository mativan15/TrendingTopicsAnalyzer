Recon Technology (NASDAQ:RCON) on Friday said it got a letter from Nasdaq notifying the company that it was not in compliance with listing rules on minimum bid price requirement.
The letter resulted from the fact that the closing price of the company's shares was below $1/share for a period of 30 consecutive business days.
As per Nasdaq listing rules, Recon has 180 days or until Nov. 28 to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
RCON said the notification had no immediate effect on the company's shares, which will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker "RCON".
