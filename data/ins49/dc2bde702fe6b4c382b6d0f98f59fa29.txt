NANYUKI, Kenya, June 2 (Reuters) - M-Pesa, the mobile phone-based African money transfer service owned by Kenya's Safaricom Plc SCOM.NR, and Visa Inc V.N launched a virtual payment card on Thursday in a bid to capture some of the continent's $40 billion-a-year subscriptions market.

The M-Pesa Global Pay Visa Virtual card will allow users to securely pay 100 million foreign merchants like Amazon and Alibaba from their mobile phones, without the need for credit cards or accounts with processors such as PayPal.
