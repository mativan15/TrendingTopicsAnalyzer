It was with great fanfare that Warren Buffet paid out $230 million for a 10 percent stake in Tesla rival BYD.  He had been to the future, and it was China.
Now, 14 years after his initial investment in China's premier manufacturer of electric vehicles, Buffett is quietly pulling the plug on this and his other China plays.  It is worth asking why.  
After all, this is the same man who parlayed a small investment into a failing New England textile company called Berkshire Hathaway nearly 70 years ago into a fortune now worth close to 100 billion dollars.
