The feature is currently in development, and was spotted by the sleuths at tech blog WABetaInfo.
WhatsApp regularly tests new features in the "beta" trial version of the app.
And evidence has emerged that WhatsApp is now building a text-editing system.
"WhatsApp is developing a new option that will let us edit text messages," WABetaInfo explains.
