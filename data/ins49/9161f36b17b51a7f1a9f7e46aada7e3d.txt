A homeless woman who allegedly robbed a dead man in New York City and has dozens of prior arrests was freed without bail Friday, according to reports. Geniece Draper, 40, was let go after her arraignment in a Manhattan courtroom, the New York Post reported. She is accused of pickpocketing a wallet from a man last week as he remained under a truck that had crushed him moments earlier. She is charged with grand and petty larceny for allegedly stealing from 62-year-old Jerome Smith. She was arrested a short time later at a Times Square subway station.
