Neighbours is lining up a particularly emotional week for Ramsay Street's finest next week, with weddings and operations all on the cards. 
Hendrix Greyson (Ben Turland) and Mackenzie Hargreaves' (Georgie Stone) wedding day arrives, and you'd best stock up on the tissues, because it's safe to say that it will be a tearjerker!
After the wedding, Hendrix is faced with getting his lung transplant. He's full of beans on the day of his surgery, doing his utmost to mask his fear. 
Mackenzie, however, sees through his bravado, and does her best to reassure him that everything's going to be okay.
