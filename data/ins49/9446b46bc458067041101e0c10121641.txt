Coming off the 6-7 season in 2021 the belief is that 2022 would be a season in which new LSU head coach Brian Kelly would need to reload. While the team did load up on transfers this past offseason, they also added some key pieces in the 2022 transition class.

Both tackle positions have been manned by freshmen and FIU transfer Miles Frazier kicked inside to play right guard. The team also has freshman tight end, Mason Taylor, in the No. 1 spot on their two-deep depth chart. Defensively the most impacted positions were in the secondary with Greg Brooks Jr, Joe Foucha, Mekhi Garner, and Jarrick Bernard-Converse joining the team from other programs.
