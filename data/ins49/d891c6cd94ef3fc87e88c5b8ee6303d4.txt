Manufacturers are increasing the availability of waterproof rangefinders and stable grip technology rangefinders. However, pros and cons of GPS & laser rangefinders are influencing buyers' decisions. Hence, brands should increase awareness and educate users about the advantages & disadvantages of both technologies whilst continuously improve the technologies to boost product sales.
