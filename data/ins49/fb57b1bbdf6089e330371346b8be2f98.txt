(photo:royal-house.nl)Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange and the heir to the throne of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, was moved to the palace from the student housing, which spoiled her plans to attend college like a regular student. Addressing the press during her recent visit to Sweden, Queen Maxima said that the princess' staying at the student housing could have enormous consequences for her life, according to reports. The queen further said that Catharina-Amalia could not live in Amsterdam and would have to confine herself to The Hague.
