Oleksandr Usyk's promoter Alexander Krassyuk couldn't help but laugh when he was asked about Tyson Fury vs Derek Chisora. The K2 Promotions chief described the WBC champion as a ‘complicated personality' and poked fun at the Del Boy trilogy.'Tyson Fury is how you say… I love him very much as a fighter and a personality, but he is a very complicated personality because you never know the day he's going to retire,' Krassyuk told ESNEWS.'So, it can happen twice, three times a week it can happen once in a month, he's calling everyone a dosser but he's asking for bigger money.
