Agencies (Representational image)To improve the ease of living for the common man, the government is planning to launch 'Jan Samarth' -- a common portal for delivery of various schemes run by different ministries and departments. As part of the Narendra Modi government's vision of minimum government maximum governance, the new portal plans to initially onboard 15 credit-linked government schemes, sources said. The offerings will be gradually expanded, depending on compatibility, as some of the Centrally Sponsored Schemes have involvement of multiple agencies, they added.
