'I think it's a change of habits,' said Simon Proulx, who opened La Taverne du Gamer, a quirky bar and retro video game shop on Rue Dufferin steps from the border, just before the pandemic.In that first month, February 2020, Proulx said, about half the people who came through the door were American.
