Tim Ben & BrookeBy Barrel BoyOct 18, 2022Someone blew apart an ATM in Palmdale, California at a Bank of America branch on Sunday with an explosive device,, which sounds like a great way to grab the money. One problem; even though police found pieces of the machine, and debris scattered everywhere, which prevented the thief from getting any money!   No injuries were reported, and no suspect has been identified so far..... AND in other News... A couple in Michigan was caught using a stolen credit card at a Tractor Supply store, after the woman used her rewards card for the transaction.
