LIMA (Reuters) - The Organization of American States (OAS) will meet on Thursday to "consider" Peru's political situation at the request of President Pedro Castillo, who last week denounced what he called a coup attempt against his government.

The OAS decision to look into the matter at its Permanent Council was published on Wednesday on the Washington-based organization's website.

Castillo's government wrote in a letter last week to the OAS that it wanted to "preserve democratic institutionality and the legitimate exercise of power.
