Donna's Gourmet Cookies, a more than 30-year-old Greater Cincinnati brand known for its small-batch, handmade cookies, brownies and bars, is under new ownership as local entrepreneur Nancy Aichholz returns to her foodie roots.

Aichholz purchased the Sycamore Township-based business late last year, and is currently in the process of transitioning into the role full time. She spent the past seven-plus years helming Covington-based Aviatra, a nonprofit accelerator tailored for female entrepreneurs.
