General Electric is ditching its 100,000-square-foot headquarters in Boston, once billed as a milestone move for the industrial giant, as it looks to downsize.

The headquarters, in the Forte Point section of the city, was initially expected to have roughly 800 employees, including 200 corporate staff and 600 digital industrial product managers, designers and developers. However, the Boston Globe, the first to report the story, said it has less than 200 employees based there, some of which only come in on a part-time basis.
