The new turning point prediction method consists of the turning point probability and fractal cycle analysis. Currently, the turning point prediction method is exclusively used for Forex and Stock market. In fact, the turning point probability and fractal cycle analysis are integrated in the calculation phase of this turning point prediction method. Several terminologies can describe their application. We ordered the terminologies by their word length.



Geometric volatility

Quantified price action

Fractal wave modelling

Stochastic cycle modelling

Geometric analysis combined with statistics

Peak and trough analysis combined with statistics

Fractal decomposition or Fractal wave decomposition

Price action combined with math or mathematical price action

The above terminologies can be applied to describe the application of the turning point probability and fractal cycle analysis in real world.
