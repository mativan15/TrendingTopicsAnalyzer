Short sellers backed off consumer discretionary stocks last month after having piled up their bets against the hard-hit sector.According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, short interest in consumer discretionary stocks tracked by the S&P 500 fell 1 basis point from the end of April through the middle of May to settle at 5.43%.This modest slip marked the first time since November that short bets on companies in the category — which tracks sellers of items that are non-essential to consumers but desirable if they have the spending power — had declined.
