Do Kwon says charges levelled against him by the South Korean prosecutors are not legitimate and politically motivated, sharing a rare update on what has become one of the most high profile events in the crypto industry this year in the aftermath of the $40 billion wipeout of his Terra blockchain.
Kwon said he has yet to receive a copy of the Interpol's red notice and his understanding is that the order doesn't include an international arrest warrant. He said in the meantime he is complying with 'all the document requests' made by the South Korean prosecutors.
