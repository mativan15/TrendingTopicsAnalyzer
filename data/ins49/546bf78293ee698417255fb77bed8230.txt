May 28—Annie's Inn has been a staple in Montmorenci for decades, and now a new family is running the show.

Sharon and Glenn DeHart came to stay at the inn recently, located at 3083 Charleston Highway, and they noticed that the building was for sale. The DeHarts had a wonderful stay and enjoyed meeting the owners, Dallas and Scottie Ruark; they decided to purchase the place.

Along with their daughter, Ashten Eudy and her husband Frank, the family is excited to get into the bed and breakfast business.
