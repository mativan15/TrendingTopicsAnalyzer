Record-high inflation and growing fears of a recession don't appear to be quelling air travel demand, according to United Airlines and its competitors, who are reporting earnings this week.

Yesterday (Oct. 19) United reported $12.8 billion in revenue for the month ending in September, up 66 percent from the same period last year. Today American Airlines reported $13.5 billion in revenue for the last quarter, up 50 percent year-over-year. Both airlines said their revenues were buoyed by strong demand, which topped analysts' expectations.
