As Sheryl Sandberg steps down from Meta after 14 years as one of the most high-powered women in business, speculation is rampant over what she'll do next.Sandberg herself says her immediate plans are to focus on her foundation, philanthropy (particularly around women's issues), and her newly expanded family. But rumors persist that she may attempt to pivot to politics sometime in the future, or perhaps assume a CEO role at another big company.Such speculation is colored, however, by Sandberg's complicated legacy—both as the number-two at a company that's been charged with everything from major privacy violations to ruining democracy, and as the author of the feminist manifesto Lean In, which prompted the corporate world to discuss gender and sexism at a time when the topics were still largely taboo, but also came under harsh criticism for its blind spots on issues like race and class.
