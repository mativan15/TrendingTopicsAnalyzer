A contractor for a Georgia aircraft manufacturer has been sentenced to nearly 7 years in prison after prosecutors say he pleaded guilty to conspiring to steal design secrets from the company, according to the Department of Justice.

Gilbert Basaldua, 63, of Hilton Head, South Carolina, worked as a 'numerical control engineer contractor' for an aircraft manufacturing company in Georgia from October 2016 through November 2018, according to a Department of Justice news release dated Oct. 20.

He was accused of stealing aircraft wing designs and 'anti-icing testing information' from different aircraft manufacturers, including the company that employed him, officials say.
