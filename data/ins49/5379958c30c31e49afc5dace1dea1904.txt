(Reuters) - French media company Vivendi on Thursday reported third quarter revenue growth of 0.6% at constant exchange rates and on a like-for-like basis, and confirmed it was still planning to spin-off its publishing business Editis.

"For Editis, the full project has been now sent to the antitrust commission, we should receive the completeness in the coming days, weeks, and we still have the project to fulfil the listing of the company during the first half of 2023,' finance chief Francois Laroze told analysts in a call.
