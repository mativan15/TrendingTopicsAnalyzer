Apple filed a lawsuit against medical tech company Masimo in federal court in Delaware on Thursday, accusing the company of "copying" its Apple Watch.The tech giant said in its lawsuit, which was earlier reported by Bloomberg and Reuters, that Masimo copied many of its designs and patents, including health-monitoring technology, case design and chargers. Masimo largely sells devices for hospitals to manage patient care, and earlier this year it bought Sound United, a holding company whose brands include Denon and Polk Audio.
