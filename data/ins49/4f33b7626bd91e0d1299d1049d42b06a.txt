U.S. stocks opened sharply higher on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average advancing nearly 600 points, as stocks rebounded following Friday's punishing selloff. The S&P 500 SPX, +2.61% climbed 80 points, or 2.3%, to 3,663. The Dow DJIA, +2.11% gained 568 points, or 1.9%, to 30,203. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +3.18% advanced 276 points, or 2.7%, to 10,598. Analysts attributed the risk-friendly mood in U.S. markets to the latest news out of the U.K., where the newly installed Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt abandoned the majority of the £45 billion ($50.
