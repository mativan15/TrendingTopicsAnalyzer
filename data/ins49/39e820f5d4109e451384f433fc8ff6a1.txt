President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Russia was ready to facilitate the unhindered export of grain from blockaded Ukrainian ports in co-ordination with Turkey, according to a Kremlin readout of talks with President Tayyip Erdogan.Besides the death and devastation sown by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the war and the West's attempt to isolate Russia as punishment have sent the price of grain, cooking oil, fertilizer and energy soaring, hurting global growth.The United Nations, which says a global food crisis is deepening, is trying to broker a deal to unblock Ukraine's grain exports though Western leaders have blamed Russia for holding the world to ransom by blockading Ukrainian ports.
