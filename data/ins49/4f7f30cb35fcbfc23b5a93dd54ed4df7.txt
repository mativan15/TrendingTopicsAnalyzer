Jacqueline Nuñez has always loved scary movies. 
While the Dorchester resident, who has been developing properties in Boston for more than 18 years, cites Halloween as the most influential horror film of her life, there's another thriller that has always resonated with her. 
'I loved The Conjuring even before I knew I was going to buy it,' said Nuñez, the owner of WonderGroup LLC.
But that's exactly what Nuñez did Thursday, when the sale closed on the 3,109-square-foot home at 1677 Round Top Road in Burrillville, R.
