The Albanese government will increase aid to Pacific countries by $900m as it declares next week's budget will deliver the biggest rise in Australia's official development assistance in more than a decade.The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, will announce the extra funding during a speech in French Polynesia on Friday, arguing the budget will be 'a major step toward the goal of making Australia stronger and more influential in the world'.And in a separate pre-budget announcement, Anthony Albanese will use an event in Western Australia to promote support for critical minerals, which is expected to be a key issue in talks with the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, on Saturday.
