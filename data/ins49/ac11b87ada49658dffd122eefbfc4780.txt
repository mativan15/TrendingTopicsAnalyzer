By Australian Associated Press Published: 01:20 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 01:20 EDT, 18 October 2022 Dominic Perrottet's dream of stamp duty reform in NSW has hit a speed bump, as he seeks to legislate the change before the election. The premier wants to give first homebuyers the option of choosing to pay an ongoing land tax rather than one-off stamp duty, while the property would not be locked into the scheme. Labor is calling it 'a forever tax' on the family home, warning it won't end with a choice for first home buyers and wants he policy to be taken to the March election, rather than introduced in January as planned.
