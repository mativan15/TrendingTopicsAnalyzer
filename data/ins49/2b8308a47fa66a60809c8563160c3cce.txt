Chinese stocks erased declines during afternoon trading as investors digested President Xi Jinping's speech, which offered support for the tech sector but disappointed investors hoping for signs of a shift away from Covid Zero.

The benchmark CSI 300 Index closed 0.1% higher after sliding as much as 0.9% Monday. A gauge of Chinese equities listed in Hong Kong also closed 0.1% higher, having earlier slumped more than 2%.
