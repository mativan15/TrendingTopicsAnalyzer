A new initiative to cut off school lunch funds for schools that deviate from federally-backed transgender policy in classrooms has South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem threatening a lawsuit.The dispute comes after new rules, proposed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, that would stop sending money to public schools that prohibit transgender youth from participating in sports or using gender-designated bathrooms of their choice. 'President Biden is holding lunch money for poor Americans hostage in pursuit of his radical agenda,' Noem said in a statement sent to the Argus Leader.
