Police are investigating after an apartment fire left at least one person dead and many others displaced early Monday in Kansas City, according to officials.

Police opened a death investigation after the overnight fire swept through the apartment building in the 900 block of Benton Boulevard, said Officer Donna Drake, a spokeswoman with the Kansas City Police Department.

The department's bomb and arson detectives are also investigating, she said.

A resident, who wished not to be identified, said she had been living with the man who died for the last few weeks while she saved money for a place of her own.
