Published: 20:12 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 20:12 EDT, 19 October 2022 San Diego Padres fans were quick to defend their star man in Juan Soto on social media following a comical error that gave the Philadelphia Phillies a chance to score for a second time in Game 2 on Wednesday. The 23-year-old, who rejected a 15-year, $440 million contract extension from the Nationals during the 2022 season and signed a $500million contract with the Padres instead, was playing his usual left fielder position at the top of the second inning when Matt Vierling, of the Phillies, came up to bat.
