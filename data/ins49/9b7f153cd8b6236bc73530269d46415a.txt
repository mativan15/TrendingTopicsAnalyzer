Core demands

The 2015 ‘agreement'

The Naga-Manipuri ‘divide'

Why the hurry?

Naga rebel group National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) or NSCN(IM) has stuck to its demands for a separate flag and a constitution in an indication that the deadlock in the peace talks with the central government, aimed at bringing an end to India's oldest insurgency , is likely to continue.The militant outfit, which has been engaged in the peace process for the past 25 years, held an 'emergency meeting' at its camp near Dimapur on May 31 amid pressure from the civil society for a negotiated settlement of the 'Naga political issue'.
