Days after Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had issued a notice to Cabinet Minister Fauja Singh Sarari over his alleged 'extortion' audio clip, the CM on Thursday said , 'Let him celebrate Diwali.'
Mann was talking to reporters informally, in his first interaction with the media seven months after taking over the reins of the state.
Responding to a question about action against Sarari, he said, 'You celebrate Diwali and let him also celebrate Diwali.'
Punjab Minister for Food Processing and Horticulture Sarari was purportedly heard in an audio clip discussing a plan to trap some contractors hired for transportation of foodgrain to allegedly extort money from them.
