They have the money, they just don't want to part with it just yet. The president of the Hamilton Cosmopolitan Club says the organisation won't yet comply with court orders to pay $57,000 to adult film actress Lisa Lewis because she cannot be trusted to pay it back if it is overturned on appeal. And while Lewis herself would not be drawn on that allegation, she said she was 'disappointed and surprised' to hear of it. In a new twist in an ongoing stoush between the club and its neighbour, Lewis – who recently won a district court civil case against the club after proving a long-term campaign of harassment against her by club members – the organisation's president Sue McLean has revealed she was wary of parting with $57,213 in damages and court costs owed to Lewis.
