Shareholders in Amazon (AMZN 1.81%) beat a rising market on Friday morning, with shares gaining 3% by 10:45 a.m. ET compared to a 1.4% boost in the S&P 500. The increase erased just a small portion of recent losses for the e-commerce giant's stock, though, which remains down roughly 30% so far in 2022
The rally was powered by a brightening outlook around economic growth and consumer spending.
