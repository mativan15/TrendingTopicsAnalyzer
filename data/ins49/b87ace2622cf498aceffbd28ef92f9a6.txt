It hasn't been the best quarter for Instem plc (LON:INS) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 22% in that time. But in stark contrast, the returns over the last half decade have impressed. In fact, the share price is 273% higher today. Generally speaking the long term returns will give you a better idea of business quality than short periods can. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 30% decline over the last twelve months.
