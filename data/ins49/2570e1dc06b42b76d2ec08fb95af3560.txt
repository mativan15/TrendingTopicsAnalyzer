Protesters have tried to block Wellington rush hour traffic on Tuesday morning, for the fourth time in less than two weeks, but have so far failed. A statement from the group Restore Passenger Rail claimed they climbed above the Mount Victoria Tunnel at the Hataitai end and unfurled a banner. Police had blocked the road in both directions, the statement claimed. However, police and a Stuff reporter at the scene confirmed the road remained open. Group spokesman James Cockle said there was an expectation from the protesters that police would block the road if they were hanging above it as they now were.
