This bear market may not exactly put you in the mood for investing. But now is actually a great time to scoop up shares of solid companies. Why? Because many are trading at a discount. Yet their long-term outlooks remain bright.
This is the case for DexCom (DXCM -2.81%). The company specializes in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems. The business is doing well today -- and is set to keep on growing. At the same time, DexCom shares have dropped 25% this year. So, if you're ready to buy the dip, this stock is one to consider.
