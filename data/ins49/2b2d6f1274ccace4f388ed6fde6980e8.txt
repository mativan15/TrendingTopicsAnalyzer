Published: 02:44 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 11:25 EDT, 17 October 2022 Alabama loses so infrequently it seems to shift the shape of the season when it happens. The Crimson Tide took an L on Saturday at Tennessee that pushed the Volunteers to No. 3 in the AP Top 25 presented by Regions Bank. The Vols received 15 first-place votes, the most they have gotten since 1999. After falling on a field goal as time expired, the Crimson Tide slipped three spots to No. 6, snapping a streak of 40 straight polls in the top five.
