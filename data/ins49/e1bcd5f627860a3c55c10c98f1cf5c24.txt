Boris Johnson stood down as Prime Minister in September, but months before that he survived a vote of no confidence from Conservative MPs. Cabinet resignations eventually forced Mr Johnson to leave office when his close allies such as Rishi Sunak quit the Government and forced him to announce his own resignation.However, the former Prime Minister has remained an MP and is considered a frontrunner to be the next leader of the Tory Party if Liz Truss does resign. After last night's chaotic fracking vote, which led to claims to bullying in the House of Commons, 14 Tory MPs have publicly called for Ms Truss to go, with many more thought to have sent letters to the 1922 Committee calling for her resignation.
