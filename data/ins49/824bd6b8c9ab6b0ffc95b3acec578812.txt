Parents are being forced to spend more than two-thirds of their salaries on childcare, according to a new survey, meaning for many it's in fact cheaper not to work at all.

Families needing full-time nursery care for a child under two spend £263.81 per week on average, according to research by financial website, Moneytransfers.com. Even parents only needing part-time nursery care for a child under two will fork out £137.
