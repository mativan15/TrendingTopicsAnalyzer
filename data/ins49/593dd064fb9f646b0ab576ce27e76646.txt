Jimmie Johnson is days away from living out his lifelong dream — one that is shared by racers all across the globe.He had previously given up on it, though, especially as his NASCAR career exploded and he had kids. But the dream he's held onto since his childhood is finally coming true, and on Sunday he'll make his Indianapolis 500 debut behind the wheel of the No. 48 Carvana/American Legion Honda for Chip Ganassi Racing.Last year, in his first IndyCar Series season, Johnson stuck to road and street courses — no ovals because of the higher speeds and increased risk.
