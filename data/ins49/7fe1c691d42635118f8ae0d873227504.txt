Mediated contract negotiations between Ontario's education workers and the province are continuing today at a downtown Toronto hotel, a day after the union was given the go-ahead to go on strike. More than 50,000 custodians, early childhood educators, and school administration staff who work in the province's public, Catholic, English, and French school boards have been without a collective agreement since Aug. 31. Despite several rounds of talks, a new contract has yet to be negotiated. In early October, CUPE announced its members had voted 96.
