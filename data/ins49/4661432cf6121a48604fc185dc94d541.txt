A contractor for Meta Platforms Inc. is cutting 144 employees who worked at a facility operated by the social networking giant in Newark.

Astreya Partners LLC expects to lay off all the workers on Nov. 18, Michelle Richard, the San Jose-based company's global human resources vice president, said in a letter to state employment officials Tuesday. The job cuts are in response to a notice given to Astreya by Meta — Facebook's parent company — Richard said in the letter.

"This layoff is the result of the client's termination of services provided by Astreya employees at the (Newark) location," she said.
