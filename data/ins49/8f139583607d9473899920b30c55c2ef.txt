 The campaign trail has come to an end but for two volunteers, their love story is just beginning. That's thanks Kelowna city councillor Mohini Singh, who can add match-maker to her resume.
'We started volunteering at Mohini's campaign and that's where it all started — becoming friends, door knocking [and] spending more time during the campaign and it all started,' said Balzor Singh.
