Hi! Is there anyone here who works in digital marketing (social media, strategist, content marketer, etc) who would like to network or is interested in mentorship? I have a background in tech, retail, eCommerce, and other industries, and would be happy to share my knowledge - I'm pretty much an open book, and am glad to offer help in any way I can.

I'm hoping to learn from someone who works for either a large agency (on large accounts) or B2B business with a mature marketing team (which has a defined strategy that has been working).
