With energy prices in EU skyrocketing, a harsh winter could shut down production in parts of the automotive sector, S&P Global Mobility reported this week.According to a report titled 'Winter is Coming,' the 'combined black swan events' of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have stretched automotive supply lines, especially with regard to semiconductors.As a result, the industry 'may face extensive pressure' from energy costs in the coming months.Starting in the fourth quarter of 2022 through 2023, quarterly production from Europe-based auto manufacturing plants is forecast to be between 4 and 4.
