The Repair Shop Jubilee Special

8pm, BBC One

The ever-affable Jay Blades and his crafty team bring us a jubilee special of the restoration show – taking four items, each with a link to (you've guessed it) the royal family, and giving them a new lease of life. First up, a woman's unfinished pearly suit, which belonged to her pearly king father. Then a hand-painted plate to celebrate Queen Victoria's coronation. Hollie Richardson

Between the Covers

7.30pm, BBC Two

'Blessed be the books.' Sara Cox's picks this week are the Margaret Atwood classic The Handmaid's Tale and Monica Ali's Love Marriage.
