Last week, a bill was passed by the Knesset, which at first glance was welcomed wholeheartedly in this house: The combat veterans' tuition scholarships bill.

It proposed that the government would pay 75% of all combat veterans' tuition fees, i.e., anyone currently serving in a combat role in the IDF will have three quarters of their college tuition fees paid by the government after the army.

Great news, I thought on reading this with my morning coffee, as the elder of my two sons, both of whom are currently serving, fits the bill.
