Mediated talks between the Ford government and the union representing education support workers have broken down, setting the stage for a possible strike in early November.
The negotiations, which were being refereed by a third-party mediator, broke late Tuesday and reached an impasse on Wednesday morning, according to a source with knowledge of the discussions.The source said mediator, Bill Kaplan, determined the two sides were 'too far apart' on salary, pensions and benefits and that both sides were 'entrenched' in their positions.
