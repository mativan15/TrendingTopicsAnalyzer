It may be hard to fathom, but the Houston Texans' defensive coaches view Jonathan Owens as a young player.

Although Owens has been in the NFL since 2019, he has only logged 19 games with seven starts to his ledger. In terms of a regular season, he has one regular season and two games under his belt.

Texans safeties coach Joe Danna detailed how Owens can still be viewed as s young player despite being 27 years old and in his fourth season.

'He's young from the sense that he hasn't played a lot,' Danna told reporters Thursday.
