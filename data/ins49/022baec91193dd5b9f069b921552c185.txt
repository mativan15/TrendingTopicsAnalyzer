The bond market splashes some cold water on the stock market's attempt at upside follow-through to Monday's strong but familiar one-day pop. Stocks still clinging to gains but are off the morning highs. The formula for continued equity strength is pretty clear in the near term: bearish sentiment, extreme low equity exposures among institutions combined with typical seasonal strength into and beyond a midterm election and beatable earnings expectations. But all of this can only likely play out with the permission of the bond market, meaning the 2-year Treasury yield must stop making new highs, and the 10-year yield needs to treat 4% as a spot for a prolonged pause if not as an absolute ceiling.
