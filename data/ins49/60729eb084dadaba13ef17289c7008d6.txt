Philanthropist MacKenzie Scott continues to spread her wealth -- her latest donation will benefit thousands of burgeoning Girl Scouts.

Her generosity is an $84.5 million donation to the Girl Scouts of the USA.

The announcement on Tuesday is the largest individual donation from a single individual in the 110-year-old organization's history.

The funds will be given to the national non-profit organization and 29 local councils chosen by Scott for projects that will help girls and young women "become the next generation of powerful women leaders," the group said.
