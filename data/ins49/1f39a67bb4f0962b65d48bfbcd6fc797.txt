	The Los Angeles City Council is set to resume in-person meetings next week in the council chamber, according to the city clerk's office.

	This week's meetings were either delayed, adjourned, canceled or held virtually as protesters filled the council chamber demanding the resignations of the council members involved in the City Hall racism scandal. While former Council President Nury Martinez has resigned, Councilmen Kevin de León and Gil Cedillo have defied calls for their resignations.
