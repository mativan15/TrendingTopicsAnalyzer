With a price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 4.6x Vista Outdoor Inc. (NYSE:VSTO) may be sending very bullish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios greater than 16x and even P/E's higher than 31x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be quite low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Vista Outdoor has been doing relatively well.
