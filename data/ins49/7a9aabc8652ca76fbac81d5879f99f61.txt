Welcome to our live blog covering all the latest politics developments and reaction as it happens.Liz Truss's Government is teetering on the brink of collapse after another chaotic day which saw the acrimonious resignation of her home secretary.A senior Tory last night claimed Ms Truss has 'hours not days' left in power, adding: 'It is Armageddon.'Suella Braverman lashed out at Ms Truss's "tumultuous" premiership as she quit and accused the Government of "breaking key pledges".Her exit, coming just five days after Kwasi Kwarteng's sacking as chancellor, means the Prime Minister has lost two people from the four great offices of state within her first six weeks in office, with all eyes on whether other Cabinet ministers could follow suit.
