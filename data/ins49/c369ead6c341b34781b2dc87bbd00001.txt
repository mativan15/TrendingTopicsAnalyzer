Elon Musk is confident the end of year for Tesla will be "epic" because electric vehicles are more desirable amid unstable gas prices, the CEO said on a call with shareholders and analysts. Tesla reeled in over $21.5 billion total revenue from the fiscal quarter ending in September. That's up from $17 billion the prior quarter when the company saw a weeks-long factory shutdown in Shanghai due to COVID-19 this spring.
