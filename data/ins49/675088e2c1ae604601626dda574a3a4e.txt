May 27—TRAVERSE CITY — Referrals to the Women's Resource Center spiked throughout the pandemic along with incidences of domestic violence.

The area nonprofit that has become the primary source of help for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence in lower northwest Michigan hosted an awareness event on Thursday.

The event featured a brief speech by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel before a short round of questions were answered by a panel. The panel included Carl Mormann, director of advocacy for the Women's Resource Center, and Monica Beck, a Michigan lawyer who specializes in sexual violence, assault and abuse cases.
