The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) led by Raj Thackeray is organising ‘Deep Utsav' (Diwali celebrations) Friday evening at Shivaji Park in Mumbai in which Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis have been invited.
'On the occasion of Diwali, MNS has decided to celebrate Deep Utsav at Shivaji Park. The celebrations will start from Friday evening,' said sources in MNS.
An MNS poster on Diwali celebrations has pictures of Shinde, Fadnavis, and Raj Thackeray, triggering speculations of a new alliance between BJP, Balasahebanchi Shiv Sena, and MNS ahead of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections that are likely to be held early next year.
