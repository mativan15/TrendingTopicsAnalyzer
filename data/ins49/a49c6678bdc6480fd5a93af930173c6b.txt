OTTAWA, Ont. — Ottawa is still buzzing about Bill Morneau and his sharp take on the Trudeau Cabinet. But it turns out Wednesday's keynote was not the first time the former finance minister has taken his former colleagues to task.

During a Feb. 25 speech in Washington, mostly overlooked after Russia's invasion of Ukraine a day earlier, Morneau took issue with the Trudeau government's approach to Canada-U.S. relations during the tumultuous era of former President Donald Trump.

'We didn't always think about our partnership first,' Morneau told the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies during a lecture on bilateral relations.
