Florida has maxed out as a three-point favorite over LSU this week, and one must keep in mind that home teams are traditionally awarded three points by oddsmakers considering the hostile environment its fanbase creates.

The Gators and Tigers are basically viewed as even squads entering their Week 7 rivalry matchup in Gainesville, and for good reason.

Both programs have a first-year SEC head coach leading the charge — Billy Napier for Florida and Brian Kelly for LSU, each team is 4-2, each offense relies on its rushing attack and each defense has improved from a year ago but remains a work in progress when it comes to giving up chunk yardage.
