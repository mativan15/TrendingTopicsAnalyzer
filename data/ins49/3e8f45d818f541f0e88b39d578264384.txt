a.k.a. Brands Holding Corp. (NYSE:AKA) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 25% in the last week. But that hardly compensates for the shocking decline over the last twelve months. Specifically, the stock price nose-dived 84% in that time. So the rise may not be much consolation. Only time will tell if the company can sustain the turnaround. We really hope anyone holding through that price crash has a diversified portfolio. Even when you lose money, you don't have to lose the lesson.
