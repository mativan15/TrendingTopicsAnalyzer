The Miami Hurricanes are flashing their offensive personality, and, at least for now, it's as a fast-paced, no-huddle passing team — regardless of how offensive coordinator Josh Gattis and coach Mario Cristobal relish the run game.

Same playbook? Gattis on Monday said yes.

But the balance has certainly changed, with good reason. Quarterback Tyler Van Dyke has reemerged with back-to-back impressive performances, again firing those deep completions with confidence. And a few receivers — Colbie Young first and foremost — have either broken out or just held on to his passes.
