Fulham boss Marco Silva says his players will relish their next Premier League challenge against Leeds on Sunday at a partisan Elland Road.Silva's side climbed up to ninth place in the table after Thursday's 3-0 home win against Aston Villa, who sacked manager Steven Gerrard shortly after.Leeds boss Jesse Marsch is under mounting pressure after his side's winless run was extended to seven games with defeat at Leicester on the same night.But Silva is wary of a Leeds backlash and cites their fervent home support as a key factor.
