Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, in an exclusive interview with MarketWatch, said his suggestion that the central bank take a September 'pause' in its push to raise interest rates should not be construed in any way as a 'Fed put,' or belief that the central bank would come to the rescue of markets.In a Tuesday interview, Bostic said the notion of any sort of 'Fed put' was never a factor in his thinking. 'I think it's a good tale on some level for story books, but it's not driving how I'm thinking about policy,' he said.
