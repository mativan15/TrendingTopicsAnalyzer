Armour Inc. (NYSE: UA) has been a leading performer in the performance apparel space since its 1996 launch. The Baltimore-based company made a splash with its lines of sportswear and accessories made from synthetic microfibers that help regulate body temperature and improve athletic performance. But like many retailers, Under Armour is struggling to compete with Amazon and other online retailers, resulting in disappointing earnings for much of 2018. That same year, Ryan Kuehl, senior vice president of global sports, and Walker Jones, senior director of sports marketing, were both let go, reportedly after an internal review of their team.
