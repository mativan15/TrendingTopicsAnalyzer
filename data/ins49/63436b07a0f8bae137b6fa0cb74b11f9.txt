The past 19 months have been a 'white-knuckle ride' for David Forde. When he took over as chief executive at C&C in November 2020, the drinks giant was reeling from seven months of Covid-19 and would continue to feel the effects well into 2021.Much of its on-trade business — which before the pandemic accounted for 80 per cent of group revenues — had been diminished, as pubs and restaurants closed for months.
