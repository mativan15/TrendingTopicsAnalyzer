Penn State wrestling icon Bo Nickal had as impressive a debut in the world of MMA as he could have asked for. Nickal wasted no time in knocking out his first opponent in an MMA ring, thus living up to the hype the former Division 1 national champion had coming into the world of mixed martial arts. And after his first match, Nickal put the rest of the MMA world on notice with a stern warning.

'Every single middleweight on the planet, I don't care what organization you're in, UFC, Bellator, PFL – doesn't matter, I'm coming for all y'all,' Nickal said during his post-fight interview according to MMA Junkie.
