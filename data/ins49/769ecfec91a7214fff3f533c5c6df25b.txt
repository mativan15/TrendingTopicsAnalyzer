MicroStockHub/iStock via Getty Images State Street (NYSE:STT) shares accelerated 4.7% in Tuesday premarket trading after its third-quarter earnings reflected robust net interest income growth that partly helped to offset fee revenue deceleration from market volatility. Of note, the asset manager said it intends to buy back approximately $1B of its common stock in Q4. Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.82 (excluding notable items of $0.02) topped the average analyst estimate of $1.78, but dipped from $1.91 in Q2 and $1.
