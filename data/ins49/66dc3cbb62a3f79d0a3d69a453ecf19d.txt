Shares of Generac Holdings Inc. GNRC, +2.63% sank 10.7% toward a more than two-year low in premarket trading Wednesday, after the maker of home and industrial power systems reported third-quarter profit and sales that fell well below expectations and cut its full-year outlook, citing disappointing residential sales. Net income fell to $58 million, or 83 cents a share, from $132 million, or $1.93 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted earnings per share of $1.75 missed the FactSet consensus of $3.
