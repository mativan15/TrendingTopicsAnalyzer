June 02, 2022 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time WESTLAKE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--According to Charles Schwab's SDBA Indicators Report, an industry-leading benchmark on retirement plan participant investment activity within self-directed brokerage accounts (SDBAs), the average account balance across all participant accounts finished Q1 2022 at $332,017, a 0.51% decrease year-over-year and a 6.25% decrease from Q4 2021.

SDBAs are brokerage accounts within retirement plans, including 401(k)s and other types of retirement plans, that participants can use to invest retirement savings in individual stocks and bonds, as well as exchange-traded funds, mutual funds and other securities that are not part of their retirement plan's core investment offerings.
