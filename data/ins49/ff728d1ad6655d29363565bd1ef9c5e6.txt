Struggling wireless Internet service Starry is cutting half of its workforce amid a major cash crunch.The Boston company has seen its stock price crater by 83 percent this year as it tries to build out its wireless service in a handful of cities, including Boston, New York, and Los Angeles. Starry had about 91,000 customers across seven markets at the end of September, a 66 percent increase from a year earlier.'This is an extremely difficult economic climate and capital environment, and at present we don't have the capital to fund our rapid growth,' chief executive Chet Kanojia said in a statement.
