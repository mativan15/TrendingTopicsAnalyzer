The Handmaid's Tale star Elisabeth Moss has defended the show after yet another one of its bewildering scenes.
Keeping audiences on their toes over the past five seasons is nothing new for the dystopian series, but one scene this week left viewers confounded after June decided to help Serena (Yvonne Strahovski) deliver her baby.
Despite being held at gunpoint and essentially held hostage (again) by her former captor, June jumped in to act as a midwife when Serena started going into labour.
