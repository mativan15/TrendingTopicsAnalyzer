Nothing about the death of a loved one is easy. But Hunter Ruff wants Upstate families to allow his family to make one part of the process a little easier.

Upstate Memorials creates, sets, inscribes and renovates the gravestones and monuments that memorialize the people its clients want to honor.

'I like to help families get through their time of uncertainty. I talk them through the whole process and guide them and answer their questions,' says Hunter Ruff, who owns the company with his wife of 10 years, Kindra.
