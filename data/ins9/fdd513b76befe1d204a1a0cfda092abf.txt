PARIS — It is not easy to find Horlogerie du Passage, a watch repair workshop nestled in Passage du Chantier, one of the narrow stone-covered alleys found throughout the city's Right Bank.

Blink while you're walking along Rue du Faubourg St.-Antoine, a busy road in the 12th Arrondissement, and you might miss the entrance to the passage, which dates to 1842. But once you make the turn, the atelier is right there.

It is a single room — 15 square meters, or slightly more than 160 square feet — filled with three workstations, machinery ranging from a polishing machine to a unit that tests a watch's water resistance, and a wall lined with sets of tiny drawers to store watch parts.
