To those who say office work is valuable, consider: Forgoing a commute has put 60 million hours back onto the clocks of those working from home each day. That's according to new research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, released Tuesday. The Fed's data comes from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which tracked how employees spent their new influx of spare time. Sorry, bosses: It revealed that most of that time went toward sleep and personal activities, not to work. Younger workers tended to spend more hours per week on leisure activities, which encompass everything from socializing at bars or restaurants to exercising via a long run or going to a workout class.
