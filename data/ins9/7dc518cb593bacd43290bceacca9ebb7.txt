Timberwolves update: Back at practice Tuesday after missing the final preseason game because of a shoulder injury, backup point guard Jordan McLaughlin should be good to go. The Wolves open the season with two of their first three games against OKC, a team that finished last season with a 24-58 record, fourth worst in the NBA. The Wolves went 4-0 vs. the Thunder last season, winning those four games by an average of 26.3 points. Minnesota is 24-9 as a franchise in home openers.
