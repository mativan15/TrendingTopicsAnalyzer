On average, household energy bills in the UK will not exceed £2,500 this winter. However, individual expenditure will vary widely depending on consumption habits and, most importantly, how the home is heated. While the quality of a house's insulation plays a major role, making the most of a broad range of heat sources this winter could save hundreds of pounds. Within days of taking office, Prime Minister Liz Truss addressed the worsening energy crisis by announcing the Energy Price Guarantee. Coming into effect on October 1, the scheme capped the unit cost of electricity and gas in the UK so that the typical household energy bill would not exceed £2,500 a year.
