During ANTIQUES ROADSHOW's visit to Madison, Wisconsin, in 2009, a guest named Vie brought in a letter written and signed by Frank Sinatra on May 4, 1976, to newspaper columnist Mike Royko. Sinatra wrote a scathing letter in response to Royko's article in the Chicago Daily News accusing him of hiring a private Chicago Police Force detail while there were dangerous crimes happening in the city. When Royko realized there was public interest in the letter, he published it in the Daily News and put it up for auction with the intent of donating the proceeds to the Salvation Army.
