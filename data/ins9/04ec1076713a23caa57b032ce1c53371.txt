 Alec Baldwin is remembering Halyna Hutchins one year after her death. On Friday, the 64-year-old actor posted a tribute to cinematographer Hutchins, who died on the set of their Western film Rust in New Mexico on Oct. 21, 2021. Hutchins was 42 when she died after a prop gun held by Baldwin that turned out to contain live rounds discharged. Director Joel Souza was also wounded in the incident, and Baldwin maintains that he did not pull the trigger.
