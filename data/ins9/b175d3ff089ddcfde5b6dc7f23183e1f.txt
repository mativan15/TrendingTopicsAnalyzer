TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares gained Friday as investors cheered a strong set of earnings from retailers that has sent U.S. shares higher.Benchmarks were rising in early trading across the region, including Japan, China, Australia and South Korea.'Improved risk sentiments in Wall Street, along with earnings outperformance from Alibaba and Baidu, may aid to fuel some upside for the Asia region into today's session,' said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG in Singapore.Shares of Alibaba and Baidu have surged after they reported better than expected results, easing some concerns about the negative impact from restrictions to curb COVID-19 infections.
