By Joe Hoppe Network International Holdings PLC said Wednesday that revenue increased in the third quarter, and reiterated its full-year expectations. The FTSE 250 payment company said quarterly revenue increased 28% from the same period a year earlier, though it didn't provide a figure. Revenue growth reflected the large number of customers signed the year before and the continued strength in the number of transactions, which grew in the year to date, the company said. The company won record levels of new business in the United Arab Emirates and continued its market entry in Saudi Arabia during the third quarter, it said.
