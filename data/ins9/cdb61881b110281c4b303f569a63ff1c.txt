Published: 00:21 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 00:21 EDT, 21 October 2022 Australia have received a major boost on the eve of their Twenty20 World Cup defence with Mitch Marsh firming to be able to bowl in their tournament opener against New Zealand. Marsh has not bowled since injuring his ankle against Zimbabwe in August, having played as a batter only in the lead up to the World Cup. Australia had initially thought Marsh may not be able to bowl until against Sri Lanka in Perth on Tuesday at the earliest.
