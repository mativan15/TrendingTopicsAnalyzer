 Equity benchmarks failed to hold on to early gains and came under selling pressure in a choppy session on Wednesday, with the Sensex tanking 185 points amid mixed trends from global markets. High crude oil prices and foreign fund outflows also played spoilsport. The 30-share BSE Sensex declined 185.24 points or 0.33 % to settle at 55,381.17. During the day, it dived 474.98 points or 0.85 % to 55,091.43 after an initial rally.
