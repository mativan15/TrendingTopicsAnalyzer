India's finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has indicated the nation will uses its looming presidency of the G20 group of nations to push for multilateral regulation of cryptocurrency.
Speaking during a visit to the US this week, Sitharaman said India hopes to lead an assessment of work on digital money already undertaken by other G20 members, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and then develop a regulatory framework to control use of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.
Sitharaman said multilateral regulation is desirable because she and other G20 members are aware of cryptocurrency being used to launder money and facilitate the global trade in illicit drugs.
