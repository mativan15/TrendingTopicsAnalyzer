Pop star Guy Sebastian sent an 'urgent' text message to another witness during a break from giving evidence in the embezzlement trial of his former manager, a court has heard.

Titus Day, 49, is on trial in the NSW District Court accused of defrauding his long-time client of almost $900,000, including royalties and payments for destination weddings. He has pleaded not guilty to 50 counts of embezzlement and 50 alternative charges of larceny.

Guy Sebastian leaves court on May 23, shortly before the messages were sent.
