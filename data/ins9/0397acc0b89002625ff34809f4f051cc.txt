CBC Ottawa gave several mayoral candidates an opportunity to make a pitch directly to Ottawa voters.

Param Singh, who was an Ottawa police officer for 19 years, said he is a candidate that believes in accountability and transparency.

He said there is a divisiveness at council that has made them "prone to make quick decisions, which has been disastrous for Ottawa," using the LRT as an example.
