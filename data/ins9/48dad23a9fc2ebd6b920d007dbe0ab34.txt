CEVA, Inc. (NASDAQ:CEVA) has come roaring back in the past week or so. In doing so, CEVA has managed to cut its YTD losses in half. In addition, CEVA has raised its FY2022 guidance, further emboldening the bulls. However, CEVA may not yet be in the clear despite the recent momentum. CEVA could still go either way. Why will be covered next.

Resistance is looming

The stock has been on fire lately with a gain of 13% in the last four days, sharply reducing YTD losses to a more modest 14% compared to losses of as much as 26% when the stock hit the low of the year on May 11.
