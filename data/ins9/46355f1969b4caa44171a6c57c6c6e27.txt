The $114 million in funds siphoned out of decentralized crypto exchange (DEX) Mango Markets wasn't the result of a hack, according to former FBI Special Agent Chris Tarbell.

Tarbell, who previously worked at the FBI's cybercrime squad in New York, told CoinDesk TV's 'First Mover' the exploit of Mango Market was 'more of a market manipulation.'

'This wasn't [about] getting into a system and getting unauthorized access,' Tarbell said, referring to the strategy used by the illicit actors.
