GLACE BAY, N.S. - The rugged beauty of Cape Breton's coastline has been attracting people to the water's edge for years, but getting too close has dangerous consequences. 'From where I live, I've seen too many times over the years, I can look right over the water and see the choppers, the search boats out there looking for people that got too close to these cliffs. Please people, stay away from the edge of these cliffs. you don't know how dangerous they are,' urged Billy Cameron, who lives near cliffs in Glace Bay, N.
