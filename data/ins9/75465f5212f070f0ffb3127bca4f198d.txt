The Oklahoma City Thunder will not be on national TV for a third consecutive season.
The NBA announced on Wednesday that the Orlando Magic vs. Thunder game on Nov. 1 will no longer air on TNT, being replaced by the Chicago Bulls vs. Brooklyn Nets game on the same day.
This is unfortunate news as the Thunder — sans NBATV games — have no appeared on national television since the 2020 NBA playoffs.
The league likely decided to pull the plug on airing the Thunder game after Chet Holmgren was ruled out for the entire 2022-23 season as he rehabs a Lisfranc injury.
