The Vatican's Institute for the Works of Religion, commonly known as the Vatican Bank, had been accused of sending money to Solidarity.
The woman, whose face is obscured in the documentary, said that Emanuela told her she had 'a secret to confess' in a conversation they had about a week before her disappearance.
Emanuela said that as she was strolling through the grounds of the Vatican, where she lived with her family in a grace and favour apartment, she had been 'bothered' by a 'person very close to the Pope'.
