Rihanna looks absolutely incredible in a new video for Fenty months after giving birth.
The pop star and businesswoman, 34, welcomed her first child with rapper A$AP Rocky in May, after the couple announced the news in January of this year.
New mum Rihanna has kept her child firmly out of the spotlight, not revealing their name or sex, and her social media posts remain strictly professional rather than giving a glimpse at her family life.
