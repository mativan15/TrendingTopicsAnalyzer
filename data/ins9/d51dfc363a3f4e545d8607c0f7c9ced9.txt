By Reuters Published: 17:05 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 17:05 EDT, 17 October 2022 Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Cameron Brate underwent testing and X-rays on his neck showed no fractures, coach Todd Bowles confirmed Monday. "He has a sprained neck," Bowles said. "He has all his extremities moving well and he's resting. That's been the extent of it. Everything else came out negative." Brate, 31, was released from a Pittsburgh hospital late Sunday night following a scary helmet-to-helmet collision.
