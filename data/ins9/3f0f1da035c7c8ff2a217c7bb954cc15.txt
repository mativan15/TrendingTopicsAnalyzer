Apple has officially announced the next generation of the iPad Pro, which includes Wi-Fi 6E support and is powered by the new M2 chip. M2 was announced earlier this year and debuted first on the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro 2022 refreshes.

Both the 12.9-inch and 11-inch iPad Pro models include a new "hover" feature, which Apple claims will allow an Apple Pencil to be detected up to 12mm above the display, allowing "users to see a preview of their mark before they make it."
