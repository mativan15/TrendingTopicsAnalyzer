What do Snooki, Dave Matthews, and Representative Bill Pascrell have in common? Not much—save for John Fetterman. The Pennsylvania lieutenant governor, who is running to represent his state as the Democratic nominee for US Senate, has turned to a motley crew of personalities in television, music, politics, and beyond to supercharge his campaign against Republican Mehmet Oz. But not everyone knows about the Hollywood celebrity who boosted Fetterman long before it was mainstream: Paul Rudd.The Ant-Man and Clueless actor, who will appear alongside Fetterman at a Wednesday night fundraiser, initially reached out to the candidate last summer, according to his campaign, just after Fetterman inserted Rudd into a tweet mocking Republican state lawmaker Doug Mastriano for issuing an official letter requesting an audit of the 2020 presidential election.
