Jamie Carragher expects defending champions Manchester City to be held by struggling Liverpool this weekend, while Gary Neville says it will be ‘fascinating' to see how Virgil van Dijk copes with Erling Haaland.
Man City travel to Anfield on Sunday for a mouth-watering clash between the two stand-out teams in the Premier League in recent years.
Liverpool finished just one point behind Pep Guardiola's side last season but already find themselves 13 points adrift of Man City this term.
The Reds have won just two of their opening eight league games to slip to 11th, four points above the relegation zone.
