On Sunday, a collection of 2,300 delegates from the Communist Party of China will convene for a weeklong conference to choose China's next leader. The victor is almost certain to be current President and General Secretary Xi Jinping, who would be the first to serve more than two terms as the Party's leader since Mao Zedong. But any celebration of Xi's third term will be dulled by the reality that exists outside the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square: a flagging economy beset by multiple crises, 'including the fallout of its zero-COVID strategy, a faltering property sector, and financial stresses boiling over,' says Eswar Prasad, a senior professor of trade policy at Cornell University.
