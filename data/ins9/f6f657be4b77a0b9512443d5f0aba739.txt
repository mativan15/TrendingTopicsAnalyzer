DNY59 Bearish again I've been publicly bearish S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) since March 25th 2022. However, I've been trying to find the "hole" in the bearish scenario, and to see the "glass half-full". In fact, I turned bullish on May 30th, just before the summer rally, before resuming again with the bearish view on August 15th. Just recently on September 29th, I tried to time another "bounce" higher, but this time, it's very hard to justify the fundamental logic for even a short-term bullishness. Thus, as I will explain in this article, I am resuming my bearish on SPY.
