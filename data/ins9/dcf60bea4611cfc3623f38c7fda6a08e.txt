When Abby Allen started working at Pipers Farm in Devon in 2012, at the age of 24, its social-media offering was pretty well nonexistent. She immediately recognised the potential of the 50-acre family farm on the edge of Exmoor. 'From the office you'd see the Devon red rubies [cattle] grazing on wildflowers, butterflies, hedgerows and, as the seasons changed, I used to think, ‘All we need to do is show people this!'' she exclaims.'Then there's the community and characters on the farm, and the trials and tribulations,' Allen continues.
