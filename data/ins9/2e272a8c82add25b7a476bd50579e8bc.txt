Buyers beware: Don't fall for the Facebook scammers.
A TikToker has fallen prey to greedy online scammers, losing $2,250 after falling for a faux rental ad — and it nearly wiped her entire savings.
Stephanie Thacker, who is homeless and has been living with her dog in her car for over year, took to TikTok so share her horrifying story while crying on camera in a clip with 149,000 views.
'I showed up to this place, it was a listing on Facebook for an apartment and it said privately rented,' she explained in between sobs.
