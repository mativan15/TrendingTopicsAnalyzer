The U.S. based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase indefinitely suspended hiring for a wide range of roles, according to a statement published today, becoming the latest exchange to do so. A few unlucky applicants had their offers rescinded. 
The decision solidifies, and expands on a hiring pause implemented two weeks ago following a worse than expected first-quarter report, and is the latest development in a crash starting in the beginning of 2022 that resulted in more than $1 trillion being wiped out from the cryptocurrency industry so far.
