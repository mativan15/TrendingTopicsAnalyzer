We've spoken about Dart at quarterback and what Ole Miss brings to the table on the ground with Judkins and Evans, but here are some other guys to keep an eye on.
WR Jonathan Mingo
According to PFF, Mingo is the top-graded wide receiver in the SEC. His 507 yards are second only to Tennessee's Jalin Hyatt. He's averaging 23.0 yards per catch, which is the best among qualified receivers.

DB A.J. Finley
