A cruise ship buffet is often the scene of holiday drama. One guest said they saw a woman kicked off the ship after she pushed someone at the buffet.Despite controversy, some guests try to take food from the buffet out on day excursions to save money.One passenger said on Reddit: 'Can I box some food from the ship in my own box and take it with me for lunch? I don't like to eat at some random expensive restaurant on the island.'Some restaurants near cruise ports are very expensive as they are purely targeting tourists for business.
