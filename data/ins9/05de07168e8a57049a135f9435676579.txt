The Knicks open the season on Wednesday night against the Grizzlies. The Post's Zach Braziller provides three bold predictions and some schedule highlights ahead of the season.
Three bold predictions
1. Jalen Brunson is an All-Star: His strong preseason is a good omen for a big first season as a Knick. He performed that well.
2. Tom Thibodeau receives a contract extension: It comes after the Knicks advance through the play-in tournament as the eighth seed and take two games off the No. 1 Bucks in the first round.
