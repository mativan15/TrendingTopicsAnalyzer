Capcom recently showed off a hefty chunk of gameplay from the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake, and fans noticed one key, heartbreaking difference.In the original Resident Evil 4, there's an adorable pup stuck in a bear trap that Leon stumbles upon. The player can help free the dog from the trap, and the dog will return to help you out in a boss battle a bit later on. In Resident Evil 4's upcoming remake, it seems that's no longer the case. As you can see in the video below, by the time Leon reaches the trap in RE4's remake, the dog is already dead, leaving you to face the upcoming fight all on your own.
