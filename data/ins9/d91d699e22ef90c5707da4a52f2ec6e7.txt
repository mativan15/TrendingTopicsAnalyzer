It's an exciting year to be a fan of New York metropolitan area pro football teams. The Jets and the Giants, long afterthoughts or even laughingstocks in the N.F.L., are riding high. The Giants are 5-1 after rallying to beat the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday; the Jets are 4-2 after thumping the Packers in Green Bay.

Both teams won four games last year, so the Jets have already matched last season's win total, while the Giants have actually surpassed theirs. It could be the first season both teams finish the season with winning records since 2010.
