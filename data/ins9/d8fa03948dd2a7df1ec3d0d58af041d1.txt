SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia on Tuesday reversed the previous government's recognition of west Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and said the issue should be resolved as part of peace talks between Israel and Palestine.

"Australia is committed to a two-state solution in which Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist, in peace and security, within internationally recognised borders," Foreign Minister Penny Wong said during a media briefing.

"We will not support an approach that undermines this prospect.
