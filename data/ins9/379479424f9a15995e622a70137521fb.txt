Tunisia's powerful UGTT trade union has called for a national strike on June 16 to demand an increase in wages and oppose President Kais Saied's proposed spending cuts and privatisation as the country faces an economic crisis.
'All staff' at 159 state institutions and public companies will stop work to demand 'immediate negotiations to restore Tunisians' purchasing power' and guarantees that state firms will remain public, the UGTT's central committee said in a statement on Tuesday.
The UGTT has rejected proposed spending cuts and instead wants wage increases for state workers as inflation reached a record level of 7.
