India's benchmark indices ended up to 0.8% higher on Thursday, after a two-day decline, led by gains in shares of and top IT companies. Softness in crude oil prices also aided sentiment. The Sensex ended up 436.94 points, or 0.79%, at 55,818.11 and the Nifty ended up 105.25 points, or 0.6%, at 16,628. Analysts see hurdles for the market in the days ahead.

"This is a counter trend bounce, it may not be complete. We may see the Nifty stretch to 16,750 but eventually we should see it drift lower. It is only a retracement of the fall we saw from the April top," said Rohit Srivastava, founder, Indiacharts.
