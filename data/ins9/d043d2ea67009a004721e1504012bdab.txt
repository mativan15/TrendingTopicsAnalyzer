Pay for FTSE 100 bosses has recovered to pre-pandemic levels, with the average CEO taking home £3.6m ($4.5m) despite the ongoing cost of living crisis.

The median average of £3.6m is similar to 2018 levels and sees pay for bosses near the record highs of £4m, recorded in 2017, according to Deloitte's 2022 AGM-season report.

CEO wages fell over the pandemic, when company boards applied pay restraint.
