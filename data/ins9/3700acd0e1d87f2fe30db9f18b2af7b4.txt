Stephanie Keith/Getty Images News Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is about to release its third quarter earnings. On Thursday, it will give investors insights on user levels, revenue, earnings and more. Earlier this week, Netflix (NFLX) released its own earnings report, and beat expectations. NFLX rallied 13.8% after hours when the release came out. For a little context, Snap, Netflix and Meta Platforms (META) have traded like a "basket" of stocks this year. They've been missing earnings by wider margins than their larger tech peers, as a result investors have been trading them based on one another's releases.
