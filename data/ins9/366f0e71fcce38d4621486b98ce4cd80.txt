Apex Legends next season Eclipse revealed their new legend Catalyst. We got the lore trailer revealing Catalyst's backstory and motivations for joining the Apex games. Just in case you missed it, here's everything you need to know about Catalyst's background.Catalyst comes from the planet Boreas. If this sounds familiar, it's because it's the same planet Seer is from. As a brief recap, in Seer's lore trailer 'Metamorphosis', we saw Boreas's long history of environmental troubles. Boreas's moon Cleo was hit by a meteor and shattered it causing it to weaken and in turn, cause Boreas to be subjected to meteor showers, tide disturbances, and temperature fluctuations.
