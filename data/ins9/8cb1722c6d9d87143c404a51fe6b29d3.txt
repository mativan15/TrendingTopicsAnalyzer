A meteor shower is expected to take place tonight (May 30), and it may be visible in parts of the U.S.It is not certain that the shower, dubbed the Tau Herculid shower, will happen. But if it does, the sky could be filled with a thousand shooting stars.Meteor showers occur when the Earth passes through the fragmented remains of a comet or asteroid. Usually, meteor showers are caused when the Earth moves through the cloud of gas that is released from the comet as it passes near to the sun.
