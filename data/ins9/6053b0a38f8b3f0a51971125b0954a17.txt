The owner of photo-messaging app Snapchat, Snap Inc, has posted its slowest revenue growth since going public five years ago as advertisers cut spending amid rising inflation and the war in Ukraine.
Shares of Snap dropped 25 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday.
Snap is the first of the big tech firms to report quarterly earnings and the results cast a shadow for other platforms that rely on advertising revenue such as Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc, Alphabet's Google and Pinterest, which report their results next week.
