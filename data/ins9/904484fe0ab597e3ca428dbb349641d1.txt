The Calgary Film Centre has back-to-back productions booked at its facility well into next year. (Courtesy of Calgary Film Centre)Calgary's film and television industry is experiencing a massive boom — and those at the forefront say that means big money and opportunity for the city as it transforms into a go-to destination for productions.After opening the doors of the Calgary Film Centre in 2016, business development manager Erin O'Connor says the centre was busy — but things plateaued. "We now had an industry standard purpose-built film studio, which became the necessary infrastructure to grow and develop our production capacity, and in the years following opening we operated at about 60 to 70 per cent capacity with mid-budget series and features," she said.
