Marco Rajkovich, who chaired the agency during the Trump administration and is now one of its three commissioners, disclosed the existence of the group of advisers, whom he dubbed the 'Network,' in an April 2020 personnel memo that has not previously been reported. A person familiar with the agency's work later shared the memo with POLITICO.
The 'Network' consisted of 'at least 70 independent individuals, including a large contingent outside of FMSHRC,' Rajkovich wrote in the memo. He wrote that as chair he had reached out to 17 contacts, who in turn enlisted several other people 'to assist them in information gathering,' and that he consulted with the group on hiring issues and a personnel investigation on a former senior staffer.
