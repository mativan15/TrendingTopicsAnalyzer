A weaker baht is supporting Thailand's post-pandemic tourism recovery, which is key to shoring up the nation's economic performance, according to Finance Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith.

'Thailand is value for money,' Arkhom said in an interview on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation finance ministers meeting in Bangkok, highlighting the nation's appeal to travelers looking for bargains. The baht's prolonged weakness will 'surely' help get more foreigners back, he said.
