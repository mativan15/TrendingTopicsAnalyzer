The United Nations Security Council is meeting Monday in New York to discuss the ongoing crisis in Haiti.
The event is scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. ET. Watch in the player above.
Earlier Monday, the United Nations Secretary-General is called for an international 'armed action' to reopen a port in Haiti that has been shut down by conflict.
'We need an armed action to release the port and to allow for humanitarian corridor to be established. I'm talking of something to be done in support of the Haitian police, and I'm talking of something to be done based on strict humanitarian criteria, independent of the political dimensions of the problem that need to be solved by the Haitians themselves,' said UN Chief Antonio Guterres.
