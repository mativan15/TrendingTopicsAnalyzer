Published: 17:40 EDT, 1 June 2022 | Updated: 17:41 EDT, 1 June 2022 As one of our most talented living actors on screen or stage, Mark Rylance certainly knows how to speak beautifully. But sometimes it seems the essence of his acting emerges in those blank seconds between words. He hems, he haws, he pauses, he hesitates. He´s never afraid of leaving a few beats of dead space, and it keeps us off guard - often making us forget we´re hearing lines from a script. Rylance is also one of those few actors who can power an entire film, and "The Phantom of the Open" definitely rides on the strength of his signature quirky energy as it tells the true-life story of Maurice Flitcroft, a shipyard crane operator from northern England who stunned the golfing world in 1976 by entering the British Open under false pretenses - he´d never played a round of golf - and shooting the worst qualifying round in Open history.
