The honour of football's most prestigious individual award will be bestowed upon two superstars from both the men's and women's games in a glitzy ceremony in Paris tonight. Karim Benzema is an overwhelming favourite to claim the male version after a stunning last season for Real Madrid in which he fired Carlo Ancelotti's side to a memorable LaLiga and Champions League double, scoring a whopping 44 goals across all competitions.The evergreen Frenchman is expected to land his first Ballon d'Or ahead of the likes of Erling Haaland, Kylian Mbappe and Mo Salah this evening, with somebody not named Lionel Messi - who did not make the final shortlist this year - or Cristiano Ronaldo set to scoop the prize for only the second time since 2007.
