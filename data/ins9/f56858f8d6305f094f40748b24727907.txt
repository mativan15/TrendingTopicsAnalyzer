Mr Hunt confirmed a U-turn on the Government's economic agenda going forward which included ending the energy price guarantee in April 2023. Originally to last two years, the price guarantee capped household bills with typical usage at £2,500 but it will now go under a review for beyond April next year in a bid to balance the books. Energy bills are forecast to exceed £4,300 next year, according to predictions carried out by Cornwall Insights, with households looking for any further support to meet that cost.
