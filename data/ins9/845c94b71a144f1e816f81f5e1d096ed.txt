There are few events that players get hyped for more than the launch of a new Pokémon generation. And Nintendo is kicking off Pokémon's ninth generation with Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, both releasing on November 18, 2022.Earlier this month, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company invited me to test out Pokémon Scarlet and Violet before nearly anyone else. Over the course of two hours, I got to explore the new Paldea region, fight a gym leader, catch Pokémon, and even join a multiplayer Tera Raid Battle.
