'Knowing about child abuse and doing nothing' should be a criminal offence under a new law, the chairwoman of a government inquiry has concluded.
The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) has today published its final report following seven years of 15 separate investigations, hearings, evidence gathering and interim publications.
The report sets out the devastating scale of child sexual abuse, both past and present, describing the extent of the potential crimes facing the 13 million children in England and Wales today and calls for urgent action by both state and non-state institutions.
