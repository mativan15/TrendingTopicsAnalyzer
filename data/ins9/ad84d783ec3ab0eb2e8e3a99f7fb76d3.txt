Benjamin Martin in full Dracula get-up, before he was sent home to change.We certainly weren't a family that supported the royals, but there was a big fancy-dress street party round the corner and lots of my friends would be there. My stepfather did a bit of am dram and had some makeup in the house. He thought it would be funny if I went as Count Dracula. I had full makeup, including fake blood around my mouth, as well as a huge black cloak and a small coffin which I carried under my arm.I was prompted by my stepfather to seek out babies in prams and open up my cloak to cover the pram opening and pretend to bite the baby.
