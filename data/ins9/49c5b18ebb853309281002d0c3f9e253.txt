SIOUX FALLS, S.D. --News Direct-- Bluepeak

Jeremy Hofer of Sioux Falls, S.D., has seen his share of economic volatility.

The 37-year-old father of two lived through the financial collapse of 2009 as well the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Now he sees the warning signs of uncertainty ahead in 2023.

'All the inflation going on,' Hofer lamented. 'Everything is going up in prices.'

Everything except his internet bill, that is.
