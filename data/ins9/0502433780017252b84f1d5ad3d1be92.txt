bombermoon/iStock via Getty Images SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) and Wolfspeed (NYSE:WOLF) shoot higher at Thursday's open, +5.8% and +3.8% respectively, after Oppenheimer upgraded the stocks to Outperform from Perform with respective 12-18 month price targets of $334 and $105. "As investors look to balance growth with defensive postures, establishing core positions in differentiated technology platforms positioned to grow in excess of climate mitigation peers should offer hedges on inflation and recessionary concerns," Oppenheimer's Colin Rusch writes.
