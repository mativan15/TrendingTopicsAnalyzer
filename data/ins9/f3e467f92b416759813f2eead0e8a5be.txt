The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), part of the ruling alliance in Maharashtra, on Friday came out in support of its jailed leader Nawab Malik after the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) gave a clean chit to Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, in the Mumbai drugs-on-cruise case.NCP chief spokesperson Mahesh Tapase said the central agency clearing Aryan's name from the case proves that Malik "was right when he had said that the case was fake".Last year, a political storm erupted after an NCB team, led by its then Mumbai chief Sameer Sankhade, conducted a raid on the Goa-bound Cordelia cruise ship and arrested 20 people, including Aryan.
