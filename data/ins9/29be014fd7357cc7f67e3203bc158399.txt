Twitter is working on damage control after documents appeared suggesting Elon Musk wants to lay off most of the company's staff.
Sources speaking to the Washington Post revealed the billionaire plans to cut nearly 75 per cent of Twitter's employee base of 7,500 workers.
While job cuts had been expected regardless of the sale, the magnitude of Musk's planned cuts are far more extreme than anything Twitter had planned.
In response to the report in the Post, Twitter's main lawyer sent an email to all staff saying there were no plans for mass redundancies.
