As good as Yu Darvish was, Zack Wheeler was better in the Philadelphia Phillies' Game 1 victory over the San Diego Padres.

When The Athletic published their predictions for the NLCS on Tuesday afternoon, nearly two-thirds of their MLB staff picked the San Diego Padres to come out on top of the Philadelphia Phillies. Several writers pointed out that the Padres have three strong starting pitchers atop their rotation, while the Phillies only have two.

Yu Darvish, Blake Snell, and Joe Musgrove were set to start the first three games of the series for San Diego.
