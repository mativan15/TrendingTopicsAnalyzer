WINNIPEG, TRADITIONAL TREATY 1 TERRITORY, MB, Oct. 17, 2022 /CNW/ - Shelters provide protection, services and resources that enable women and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people who have experienced gender-based violence, including intimate partner violence and exploitation, to have a safe space to turn and take steps to regain an independent and self-determined life.

Supporting Indigenous-led 24/7 safe spaces, emergency shelters, and transition homes is an important part of the Government of Canada's Federal Pathway to Address Violence Against Indigenous Women, Girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People.
