By Reuters Published: 15:24 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 15:24 EDT, 19 October 2022 Indianapolis Colts All-Pro linebacker Shaquille Leonard returned to practice Wednesday, albeit wearing a red non-contact jersey. Leonard has been sidelined since suffering a concussion and injuring his nose in his Week 4 season debut against Tennessee. Leonard has yet to play a full game in 2022. He had offseason back surgery that kept him out of the first three games. Leonard, 27, made two tackles and played 16 snaps in the loss to the Titans before colliding with teammate Zaire Franklin in the second quarter.
