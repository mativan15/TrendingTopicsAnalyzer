After over six years on and off the market, a sprawling modern Gothic Revival estate in Gladwyne has sold for 66% less than its original asking price.

The 32-acre estate at 100 Maplehill Road sold for $9.26 million, according to Montgomery County property records, to a limited liability company under the name Galdwyne RHT. That is nearly $19 million less than the original $28 million asking price it first listed with in 2016.

Gladwyne RHT is affiliated with the family of Thaddeus Bartkowski, the Wall Street Journal reported.
