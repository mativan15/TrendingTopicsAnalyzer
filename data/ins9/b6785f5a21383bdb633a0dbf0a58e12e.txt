Sixteen Android apps downloaded by a combined total of over 20 million users have been removed from the Google Play store after it was discovered they contained malware which uses up data and drains batteries.

The malware has been discovered by cybersecurity researchers at McAfee who reported them to Google. The apps are no longer available on Google Play – but users who've already downloaded the apps will still be infected unless they uninstall them.
