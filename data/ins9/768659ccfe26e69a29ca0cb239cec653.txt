Slash Film Drum & Lace (Sofia Hultquist) and Ian Hultquist go back to the past for "Rosaline." The composers, known for their work on "Dickinson" and "Good Girls," score the twist on Romeo & Juliet with a similar spin of their own. There's the throwback to needle drops from early-2000s romantic comedies, as well as the renaissance instruments expected from a (loose) William Shakespeare adaptation.The duo's score features a cover of Robyn's bittersweet feel-good classic "Dancing on My Own," as well as an Enrique Iglesias cover.
