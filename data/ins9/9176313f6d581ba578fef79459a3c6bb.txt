(Bloomberg) -- Steve Bannon, a longtime adviser to former President Donald Trump, probably will serve his four-month sentence for contempt of Congress at a low-or-minimum-security lockup near Washington, DC, unless his conviction is overturned on appeal.Because the strategist has no criminal history, the Federal Bureau of Prisons 'will likely put him in a minimum security camp within about three hours of DC,' said Justin Dillon, a white collar criminal defense lawyer at KaiserDillon. On Friday, a federal judge in Washington sentenced Bannon to a jail term and ordered him to pay a $6,500 fine for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House committee investigating last year's attack on the US Capitol.
