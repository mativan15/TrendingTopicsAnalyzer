May 30 (Reuters) - The rouble firmed sharply in volatile trade on the Moscow Exchange on Monday, reversing some of last week's heavy losses as it retained support from capital controls and Russia's strong trade account.

The rouble plunged last week as the central bank slashed interest rates, signalling more cuts. The prospect of an easing of capital controls and a possible sovereign default added to downside pressure.

At 1120 GMT, the rouble gained around 7% to 61.
