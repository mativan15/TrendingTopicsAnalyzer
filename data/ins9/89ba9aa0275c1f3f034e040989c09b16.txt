A federal investigation found that a Kauai restaurant allowed several underage employees to work beyond the hours permitted by law, and denied 18 workers overtime pay.

The U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division said in a statement on Wednesday that Tahiti Nui Enterprises Inc. – operating as Tahiti Nui – allowed underage workers to work longer than federal law allows. According to the Fair Labor Standards Act, employees who are 14- to 15-years old cannot work later than 9 p.m. from June 1 through Labor Day, or past 7 p.
