Piers Morgan has urged Liz Truss to resign after Jeremy Hunt reversed nearly all of her and Kwasi Kwarteng's tax changes.
The TalkTV broadcaster was among those to call on the Prime Minister to step down after Mr Hunt's mini budget announcement.
He wrote on Twitter: ‘Resign @trussliz – it will be the only good decision you've taken as Prime Minister.'
Responding to a tweet from her account, he added: ‘Please, for the love of God, shut up. Nobody believes a word you say any more. Just go.'
Piers went on to say: ‘Britain deserves and urgently needs better than this ongoing clown show.
