Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Wednesday announced an extra compensation of ₹5 lakh to kin of 13 victims of the Thoothukudi police firing in May 2018, and underlined that 'those responsible for the incident would be brought to book'.
On Tuesday, while tabling the Justice Aruna Jagadeesan Commission's report on the firing incident, the government had said it would 'restrict' the compensation to what had already been given. Speaking at the end of a debate on the report, Mr. Stalin said the police firing at the anti-Sterlite protestors was a 'big black mark in Tamil Nadu's history'.
