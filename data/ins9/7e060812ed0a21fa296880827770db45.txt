The move comes amid a liquidity squeeze following the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) decision to hike interest rates, even as startups are seeing better customer stickiness.

'We are building a solution that will address the supply chain finance issues for startups,' said Ishpreet Singh Gandhi, founder and managing partner of venture debt firm Stride Ventures.
