Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel is growing increasingly concerned about the Federal Reserve's handling of the economy as it continues to move ahead with its hawkish rate hike and balance sheet reduction policies."This is, to me, playing with fire in terms of what could happen to the economy," he told CNBC in a Thursday interview.Siegel's concern stems from fast-declining money supply and its impact on liquidity in markets around the world, combined with overly aggressive interest rate hikes that are based on the Fed's outsized focus on lagging inflation indicators.
