On Monday morning I woke up to a pair of odd DMs on Twitter. 'Sir, Greetings, Do you have any information about Dejitaru Tsuka token,' asked one 'Dr. Joker'; another had a similar question: 'Yo dude what do you know about Tsuka.'I'd not heard about the cryptocurrency, and a quick scan suggested it wasn't worth my time: it was a classic 'shitcoin', a newly created token with no reason for existence beyond buying low and selling high.Gambling on shitcoins takes the subtext of much of the crypto space and turns it into the entire purpose.
