Exports from Shell Plc 's Forcados oil terminal in Nigeria resumed after a 10-week interruption, offering a boost to the government amid tumbling crude production this year.

Shipments restarted following the completion of repair work at the coastal facility in the oil-rich Delta state, a spokesman for Shell's Nigerian unit said in a statement on Thursday night. The company introduced the suspension on Aug. 5 due to problems with a sub-sea hose.
