The aunt of Texas school shooter Salvador Ramos has started a GoFundMe page asking for money for his grandmother — who he shot in the face before slaughtering 19 little kids and two teachers.
Natalie Salazar, who said she is ailing grandma Celia Gonzalez's daughter and Ramos's aunt, is seeking $30,000 to help pay her mom's medical bills. 
The page has raised a little over $9,000 so far.
'My mom was shot in the face and left to die alone in her home by her very own grandson,' wrote Salazar, who relatives told The Post is the sister of Ramos's mother.
