The Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes and higher mortgage rates have precipitated a housing market rebalancing, a recent report said. HomeLight's Top Agent Insights report for the fall, which polled 1,005 real estate agents between July 25 and Aug. 14, said that higher mortgage costs have driven some buyers out of the market. This means that people who can afford houses at the current borrowing rates are benefiting from a more balanced housing market that's defined by increased housing supply and less buyer demand, which has also helped to cool down home prices, the report said.
