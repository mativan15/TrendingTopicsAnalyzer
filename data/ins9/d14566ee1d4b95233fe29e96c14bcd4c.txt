Utah Senator Mike Lee is set to face his independent challenger Evan McMullin in their only debate on Monday as polls show their race for the U.S. Senate tightening with only three weeks left until the November 8 midterm election.Lee, a Republican ally of former President Donald Trump who received his endorsement, appears to be headed for a closer-than-expected election in Utah, long viewed as one of the most Republican-friendly states. Politics in Utah are driven by the state's Mormon population, who embrace a more moderate brand of conservatism that has found itself at odds with the Republican Party increasingly in the image of Trump.
