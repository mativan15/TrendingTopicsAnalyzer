Nursing home chains with some of the highest COVID-19 death rates are set to reap big financial rewards under the Ford government's $6.4-billion expansion of the province's long-term-care system.According to records obtained by the Star, more than half of the approximately 60,000 new and redeveloped beds in the government's plan are set to go to private, for-profit companies — many of which had far higher death rates than non-profit and city-run chains.Non-profit nursing homes are set to receive just over 30 per cent of the total beds.
