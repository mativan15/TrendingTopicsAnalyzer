Oct. 15—Windy Hollow Speedway is having it last regular points racing of this season Sunday at the track in southwest Daviess County.

"All of our classes have been competitive, but the most competitive classes have been the rusty bolts and street stock divisions," said Blake Smith, track announcer at Windy Hollow.

Carson Brooks, from Owensboro, has been strong in street stock all season and is leading the division.

"He hasn't won the most races, but he is consistent, which pays off in points at the end of the season," Smith said.
