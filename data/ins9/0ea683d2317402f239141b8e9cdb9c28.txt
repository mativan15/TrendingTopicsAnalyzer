Knives Out franchise director Rian Johnson has appeared to confirm Detective Benoit Blanc's sexuality at the London Film Festival press conference for its upcoming sequel.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery sees the return of the flamboyant southern gentleman detective played by Daniel Craig, as he travels to Greece to peel back the layers of a mystery involving a new cast of colourful suspects.
Featuring new stars including Kate Hudson, Edward Norton, Dave Bautista, Janelle Monáe and Kathryn Hahn, the glittering ensemble descended on London alongside writer and director Johnson ahead of the gala screening at the Royal Festival Hall at the Southbank Centre on Sunday night, which will close the festival this year.
