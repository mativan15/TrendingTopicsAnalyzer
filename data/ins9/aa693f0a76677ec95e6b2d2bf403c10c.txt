A woman left distraught after her pet cat died has spent £4,000 having the animal stuffed so she can keep him forever.

Harriet Peace, 28, was left heartbroken when her pet cat Tango died after being hit by a car in September 2021.

Rather than having the pet buried or cremated she decided to have him stuffed so it looks like he is curled up in his basket.

Peace said Tango was like a child to her. (SWNS)

The process, which was carried out by a special business in London, took seven months and cost nursing assistant Peace £4,000, but she said it was worth the price tag for the pet she said was "like her child".
