The B.C. Ministry of Children and Family Development (MCFD) kept thousands of dollars in funding from grandparents who needed the money to help care for their grandchild, a new report has found.The B.C. ombudsperson said the ministry failed to pass on $7,000 in federal financial aid to the grandparents, identified in the report Tuesday as the Taylors. The couple was eligible for the funding because their granddaughter lives with disabilities.Through an "unjust" funding model, the money intended to help the Taylors ended up in the province's bank account.
