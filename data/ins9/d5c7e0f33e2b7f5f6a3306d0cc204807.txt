There will be a changing of the guard at the Saskatchewan Legislative building with a new security team taking over. It's a change the province said will make the building safer. The group went through six weeks of training on how to keep MLAs, staff and visitors safe. 'It will be good to get back in the building and become familiar and just do our part to make sure that things are safe and taken care of and just be welcoming to everyone that comes and try to give them the best experience that they can have,' deputy sheriff Dru Black said.
