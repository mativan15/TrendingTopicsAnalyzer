The city of Gastonia has earned a AA+ bond rating, the national bond rating agency Fitch Ratings Inc. recently announced.

The high bond rating comes at a time when the city will ask voters for permission to borrow $75 million in the Nov. 8 election for road projects.

The Fitch review also added, 'The rating outlook is stable.' Ratings from Fitch generally indicate a city's financial stability and overall financial health.

'We are pleased that our city continues to be recognized for its financial stability and creditworthiness,' said City Manager Michael Peoples.
