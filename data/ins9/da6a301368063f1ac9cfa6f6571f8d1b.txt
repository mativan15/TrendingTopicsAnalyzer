Daniel Craig showcased a range of emotions during the star-studded Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery premiere at the London Film Festival on Sunday night.
The former 007 frontman – who stars as detective Benoit Blanc in the crime drama – looked dapper in a navy blue tuxedo, and was joined by his co-stars Gwendoline Christie and Kate Hudson.
Actress Gwendoline stunned in a beige gown, while Bride Wars star Kate looked sophisticated in a black and olive green dress.
Tightrope singer Janelle Monae was a vision in red in a sheer puffer gown.
