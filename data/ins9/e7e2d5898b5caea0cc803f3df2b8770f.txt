A methamphetamine dealer found with an arsenal of firearms, including a homemade shotgun, believed his illicit trade in drugs was a community service. Daron Ian Charles Gilmore's​ service has taken him out of the community, with Judge Bruce Northwood​ sentencing him in the Palmerston North District Court on Friday to 10 years' jail. Gilmore pleaded guilty to a range of firearms and drugs charges, as well as to receiving a stolen trailer, shortly before he was due to stand trial in March. He was arrested after a police crackdown on the Hells Angels' Central chapter, which has a gang pad on Palmerston North's Albert St.
