By Sabela Ojea Frasers Group PLC said Wednesday that it is buying certain intellectual property of fashion retailers Missguided Ltd. and Mennace Ltd. for 20 million pounds ($25.2 million) in cash. The U.K. sports-fashion retailer said it intends to have Missguided operate as a standalone business within the group. Missguided launched Mennace as a label brand for men's fashion in 2017. "Missguided's digital-first approach to the latest trends in women's fashion will bring additional expertise to the wider Frasers Group," Frasers Group Chief Executive Michael Murray said.
