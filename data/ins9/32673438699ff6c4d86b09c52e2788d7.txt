New Orleans Pelicans rookie EJ Liddell on Sunday signed a two-way contract ahead of the start of the regular season, the team announced.
Liddell, the 41st pick this year, suffered a torn right ACL on July 11 playing in the Las Vegas Summer League. He had surgery in late July to repair the tear and was expected to miss the majority of the season recovering from the injury.
He averaged four points, four rebounds and one assist in two games.
The Pelicans were expected to eventually sign Liddell to a contract, despite suffering the injury.
