In front of Toronto City Hall, a crowd of nearly 300 people is chanting. 'Canada! Canada! Attention! Attention!'

Among them stands Habib Athaee, a former educational specialist for UNICEF in Afghanistan, who immigrated to Canada in 2019.

'We are getting the attention of the world and the Canadian policy makers on Hazaras in Afghanistan,' says Athaee, 38.

'Hazaras have been discriminated against and oppressed,' he says.

The protest earlier this month, organized by members of the Hazara community in Canada, was part of a global outcry in the wake of a suicide bomb attack in late September on an educational centre in west Kabul.
