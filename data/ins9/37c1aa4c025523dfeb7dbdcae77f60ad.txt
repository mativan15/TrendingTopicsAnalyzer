He knows the scars the city bears from double standards that enable and empower white antiheroes while demonizing and disposing of flawed men of color.

This knowledge gave him audacity to try a fast-tracked comeback through media appearances last Wednesday, his first time speaking publicly since audio of a racist conversation he participated in leaked earlier this month.
