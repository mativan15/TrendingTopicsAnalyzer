Rebelution recorded "Live in St. Augustine" last September, then returned to the St. Augustine Amphitheatre for two shows this year.

The cameras probably should have been a dead giveaway.

Rebelution, one of the biggest-selling reggae bands in the world, played the St. Augustine Amphitheatre in September 2021 and recorded the show for a live album and DVD, "Live in St. Augustine."

They didn't tell the audience they were recording the show, but most fans probably figured it out anyway, said Marley D.
