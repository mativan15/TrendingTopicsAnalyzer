In his spare time, James L. Lathrop likes to read financial statements.

It's a habit that comes in handy in his job as North Kingstown's municipal finance director.

He hopes it will also serve him well in next month's general election, where he is the Republican candidate for general treasurer, facing former Central Falls Mayor James A. Diossa, a Democrat and winner of that party's primary. Lathrop was unopposed in the GOP primary.

Before beginning his career as a municipal finance director, Lathrop, 58, was in private practice in Connecticut as a certified public accountant.
