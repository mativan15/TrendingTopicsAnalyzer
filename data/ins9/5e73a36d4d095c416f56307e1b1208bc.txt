LOS ANGELES (CNS) - A former U.S. Marine from Whittier accused of leading a six-man scheme to smuggle weapons and ammunition to one of the most feared transnational drug cartels in Mexico pleaded guilty Tuesday to federal charges. Marco Antonio Santillan, 51, entered his plea to conspiracy to violate export regulations and conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Sentencing was set for Aug. 8 in Los Angeles federal court. The defendant and three other suspected members of the operation were arrested in January in Southern California as part of an investigation dubbed Operation Semper Infidelis, a play on the Marines' famous motto, federal prosecutors said.
