ORLANDO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Planemakers will trot out their latest models and efforts to reduce emissions at the world's largest corporate jet show this week, as a boom in private travel faces pressure over climate, supply chain woes and economic uncertainty.

The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) show starts on Tuesday in Orlando in the shadow of a United Nations aviation goal set this month to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
