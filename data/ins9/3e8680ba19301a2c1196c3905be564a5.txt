IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Iowa City High School student Jerry Mwenemkamba enrolled in an industrial technology class because he thought it could teach him life skills that would serve him after graduation.

At first, it looked boring, he admitted.

Over a month in, Mwenemkamba now sees it as an important class that 'everyone should take.'

Though it may not be in the plans to have every student enroll in a class as part of the industrial tech program at the high school, those that do are enjoying a new facility at City High located in what was previously the school's cafeteria.
