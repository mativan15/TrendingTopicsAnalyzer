The ALCS shifts to the Bronx for Game 3, and the Houston Astros can really put the heat on the New York Yankees.

The pregame narrative: The Astros won both games at home to open the series, and they've now won seven of nine games against the Yankees in 2022. Houston can take a commanding 3-0 series lead but will have to do it against former Astro Gerrit Cole, New York's ace.

Here are our Astros vs. Yankees picks for Game 3 of the ALCS on October 22.

Odds as of 8:50 p.m. ET on 10/21/2022.
