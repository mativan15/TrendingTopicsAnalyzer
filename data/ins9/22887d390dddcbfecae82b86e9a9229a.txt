Clemson continues to make noise this week in the recruiting world.
According to On3Recruits, four-star edge Colton Vasek has listed Clemson as a top-five finalist, with Oregon, Oklahoma, Texas and Texas Tech being the other four schools.
The 6-foot-6, 230-pounder is from Austin, Texas, and attends Westlake High School, the same high school Clemson quarterback Cade Klubnik attended before he joined the Tigers in the spring. Ranked as the No. 27 edge in the class of 2023 by 247Sports Composite, Vasek earned 38 offers before cutting his list down on Thursday night.
