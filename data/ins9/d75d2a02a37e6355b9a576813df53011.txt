 A Christian group is spending $100 million on a new campaign to promote Jesus Christ and the values they believe he held. The "He Gets Us" campaign has already started appearing online and will take over billboards and airwaves across the nation with the goal of presenting Jesus in a new light to Millennials and Gen Z, according to Christianity Today. The group's TV commercials — including a Super Bowl ad, per The Washington Post — and content optimized for other high-profile platforms were created with assistance from Michigan-based marketing agency Haven.
