Sony's not-E3 State of Play took place at a time of transition for both the platform-holder and the games industry more generally. Xbox has pulled the rug out from under Sony in the last few years by focusing its efforts more on the software and service (which is to say: Game Pass) rather than the hardware. Sony and the PlayStation brand has meanwhile soldiered on as if the console wars were still a thing, sexy console specs and big exclusives, while the industry at large gravitates towards a more platform-agnostic approach.
