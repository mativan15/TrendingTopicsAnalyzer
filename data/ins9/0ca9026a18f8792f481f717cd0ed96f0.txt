More than 700 branch managers of post offices were sentenced because of faulty accounting software. The software made it look like the money was gone from the sites. And the heart of this IT scandal of the Post Offices is a Japanese firm Fujitsu. The firm developed this accounting software named Horizon, according to reports. On Friday, the legal representatives of Fujitsu will make their opening statements as the public inquiry is underway. Though the company Fujitsu is generally known as the maker of laptops to Brits, they become entangled in one the most extensive miscarriages of justice in the legal history of the UK.
