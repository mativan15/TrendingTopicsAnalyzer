ProShares' bitcoin (BTC) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) went live on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) a year ago, allowing investors to take a bullish exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency without having to own it.

Since its debut, the long BTC futures-based ETF has underperformed bitcoin by 1.79%, according to data tracked by Arcane Research. In other words, the ETF, trading under the ticker BITO on NYSE, has bled slightly more than bitcoin, which has declined nearly 70% since the fund's launch date of Oct 18, 2021, according to CoinDesk data.
