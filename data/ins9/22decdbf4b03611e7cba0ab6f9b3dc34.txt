The journey of Micro-Face isn't over just yet. Micro-Face has his own cheese, his own musical, and now his own auction! The superhero's next stop: eBay. We've set out to transform our Micro-Face comic book into the most collectible item ever created. Will we succeed? Let the market decide! For one week only, you will have a chance to bid on a one-of-one, official collectible comic book featured in the Planet Money Buys A Superhero series episode, "PM Live: The Most Collectible Comic Book Ever?" As documented in that episode, this collectible edition of our Micro-Face comic book incorporates as many "collectible lessons" as we could apply to one book.
