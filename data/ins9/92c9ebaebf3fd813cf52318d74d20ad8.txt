Punjab Congress chief Amrinder Singh Raja Warring Monday hit out at the rivals parties for terming veteran leader Mallikarjun Kharge as a 'proxy' candidate of the Gandhi family, saying the 'transparent' presidential poll in the grand old party has robbed them of the 'dynastic' charge. Even Shashi Tharoor, the other candidate in the presidential race, has not questioned the transparency and impartiality of the poll, Warring added.
'Since they have been robbed of the argument of dynastic politics with the democratic and transparent election process in the Congress, they have started saying so and so is the proxy candidate of the Gandhis.
