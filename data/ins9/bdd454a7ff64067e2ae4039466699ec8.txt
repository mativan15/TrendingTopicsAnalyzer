It's funny how politics works in this country. I mean, if a voter bribes a politician, the guy passing money under the table to get special treatment from the pol could wind up in prison for a long time. But if a politician makes a deal, not with one voter but with millions of them, by offering goodies in exchange for their votes, it's not called 'bribery' and it's not even a crime. It's called 'politics as usual.'
While both parties are guilty of doing this, Democrats have a more accomplished record for this kind of thing.
