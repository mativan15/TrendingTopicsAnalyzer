Pune: The chairman and managing director of the defence utility Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Dinesh Batra, said on Friday that the company is assessing an investment in a semiconductor fabrication facility (fab) with a significant investment, in the picture of the Union government's support for such facilities in recent months, adding that BEL is also looking at diversifying its business in non-defence portfolio, particularly in railways, e-mobility, among others.'We are already working with NHPC to manufacture solar equipment, such as solar cells, wafers, and others.
