Rory McIlroy has sympathised with those who have decided to join the LIV Invitational Golf Series, with former world No. 1 Dustin Johnson headlining those committed to the breakaway circuit. The entry list for the Saudi-backed series' inaugural event in London next week was named on Wednesday.The likes of Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Sergio Garcia have all been named to play at the Centurion Club next Thursday, however the biggest name - and surprise - on the list is Johnson. Earlier in the year the 2020 Masters champion confirmed that he would be declining the invite to compete.
