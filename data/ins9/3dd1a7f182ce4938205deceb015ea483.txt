The Delhi government has begun spraying the PUSA bio-decomposer on harvested paddy fields in Delhi in an effort to help decompose the stubble and clear the fields before the next crop is sown.
The government is targeting 5,000 acres of farmland in Delhi this year. So far, 957 farmers have applied to get the decomposer sprayed, according to Environment Minister Gopal Rai. This is the third consecutive year that the Delhi government is spraying the decomposer in an effort to prevent stubble burning.
