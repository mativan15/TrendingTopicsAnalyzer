A Silent Hill 2 remake is in the works, along with more games and even a new movie. Konami revealed its upcoming Silent Hill lineup Wednesday, with the remake being the lead announcement. Leading development of this remake is Bloober Team, a Polish game studio behind other horror titles including Layers of Fear, Blair Witch and The Medium. 
The remake will be re-created from the ground up using updated visuals with an over-the-shoulder camera view and other modern features, but will keep the spirit of the original.
