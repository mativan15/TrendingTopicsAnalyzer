A coalition of anti-monopoly activists are calling for the Department of Justice to end Ticketmaster's domination of ticket sales to major music and sporting events in the United States. The 'Break Up Ticketmaster' campaign is seeking to unwind the 2010 merger between Live Nation and Ticketmaster, that the activist group says gives the ticketing giant more than 70 per cent market share.'Ticketmaster's market power over live events is ripping off sports and music fans and undermining the vibrancy and independence of the music industry,' Sarah Miller, Executive Director of the American Economic Liberties Project, said in a statement.
