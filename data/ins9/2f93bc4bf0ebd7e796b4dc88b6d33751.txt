Sir, I am ashamed of my party and for my country. I joined the Conservative Party in 1956, fought my first constituency in 1964, and have been in parliament for 52 years. Never have I experienced such chaos as in the last two years. Quite rightly a charlatan was removed from the highest office, only to be replaced, because of our absurd system of electing a successor, by an incompetent ideologue. She has now recognised that her government has lost all credibility. It is the duty of Conservative MPs to see that she can recommend to the King a leader who can command broad support and who will, in turn, create a broadly based and credible administration.
