Jamie Carragher talked about Chelsea's Kepa Arrizabalaga's individual performance against Aston Villa on Sunday. Mason Mount, who capitalised on a poor mistake from opposition defender Tyrone Mings, put Chelsea in front within six minutes with his first goal of the season.

Kepa Arrizabalaga, who played as a goalkeeper for Chelsea gave a stunning performance in the game and kept the audience mesmerized. The score of the game was 2-0. That is, Graham Potter's side has defeated Aston. 
The Chelsea goalkeeper made some fantastic saves for his team.
