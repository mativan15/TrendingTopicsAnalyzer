The U.S. equity market has had a difficult ride in 2022. Rising inflation and subsequent interest rate hikes, geopolitical tensions, and stalling economic growth have been exerting downward pressure on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. The recent sell-off has unduly punished many high-quality tech stocks. Technology giant Alphabet (GOOGL 0.11%) (GOOG 0.09%) is one such stock and not even an upcoming stock split has been able to save the company's shares from the downfall.
A major beneficiary of stay-at-home requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic, Alphabet's Class A shares are currently down about 24% from their all-time high of $3,030.
