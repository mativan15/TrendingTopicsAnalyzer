Tom Werner/DigitalVision via Getty Images Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:UVE) remains stable in a stormy market landscape. The challenges are more evident - inflation and insurance exodus in Florida, to name a few. But, revenue growth and adequate cash balances allow it to withstand the blows. Meanwhile, the stock price is moving sideways. It appears to be in line with the still uncertain environment. But, it makes it cheaper and undervalued, offering more opportunities for gains. Also, dividend payments are consistent and sustainable.
