Ohio lawmakers are expected to dole out nearly $1.1 billion in incentives and tax assistance for Intel's semiconductor project in Licking County.

The huge investment in roads, infrastructure and tax changes, which includes both state and federal taxpayer money, was included in the state's capital budget, which the Ohio Legislature is slated to approve Wednesday.
