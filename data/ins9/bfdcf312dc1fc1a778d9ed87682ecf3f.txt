LOS ANGELES (CNS) - The former marketing director for the Valencia- based California Institute of the Arts has dropped his lawsuit against the private art university in which he alleged he was fired in 2019 because of his age and that it occurred a week before he and others were scheduled to evaluate the performance of the university president. Lawyers for plaintiff James Wolken filed court papers on Wednesday with Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Timothy Patrick Dillon seeking dismissal of their client's case "with prejudice," meaning it cannot be refiled.
