Last week, everyone who has already had the privilege of seeing Rian Johnson's Knives Out sequel Glass Onion politely informed the internet that both Angela Lansbury and Stephen Sondheim make cameos in the film as themselves, with this being the final onscreen appearance from Lansbury after her death (it's also Sondheim's final onscreen appearance, but he wasn't really known for being 'onscreen' anyway).
