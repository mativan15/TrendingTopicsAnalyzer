Global investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG has decided to sell its US Asset Management Arm. Reuters reported that the investment banking giant had started the process of selling its American division. The troubled Swiss bank has made the decision to redesign its business after several scandals involving it came to light. According to reports, interested buyers for the US arm of one of Europe's largest investment banks are expected to place their offers by the end of this week. A source from Credit Suisse informed the media that the banking giant still had a chance to retain the business if the sale did not materialise as planned.
