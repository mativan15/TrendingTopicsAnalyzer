Recent episodes of Emmerdale have shown Amelia Spencer (Daisy Campbell) becoming increasingly concerned about her body image and in coming episodes we'll see this start to become a serious problem for her as she resorts to taking dangerous supplements in an effort to control her weight.
We've seen Amelia get upset after a picture of her that Gabby (Rosie Bentham) posted on social media got lots of likes – but then one horrible, negative comment from a troll. Amelia has been spending money on buying gym clothing and has mentioned that she feels her body is far from the ideal.
