OPEC is a cartel of major oil producers, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia. It met last week (Wednesday) and decided to make its biggest production cut since the start of the pandemic. The decision to slash oil production by 2m barrels per day is a move that will likely send gas prices higher.

Consumers and governments will not be big fans of this move. Rather, the biggest winners will be FTSE 100 oil stocks and their shareholders.

Bullish market reaction

The cut to production, equivalent to about 2% of global oil demand, won't begin until November.
