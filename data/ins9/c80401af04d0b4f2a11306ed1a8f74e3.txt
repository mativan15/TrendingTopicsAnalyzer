HORSHAM, Pa. — Pennsylvania lawmaker Todd Stephens is the kind of Republican who has always counted on support from Democrats to help win his seat in the statehouse.

But as he campaigns house to house in the Philadelphia suburb that he's represented for more than a decade, one of the state's last remaining Republicans who favors abortion rights is finding that his party's record often looms larger than his own.

When doors open, he touts his votes against his colleagues' attempts to restrict abortion and reminds constituents that the Democratic governor invited him to speak at an event on reproductive health this past summer.
