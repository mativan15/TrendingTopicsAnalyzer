Sundry Photography/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Momentive Global (NASDAQ:MNTV), the parent of SurveyMonkey, soared 20% in premarket trading on a report that the company is considering a possible sale after getting takeover interest. The company is working with an adviser and no final decision has been made on a possible sale, according to a Bloomberg report, which cited people familiar. A possible sale comes after Zendesk (ZEN) agreed to buy Momentive (MNTV) last year for $4.2 billion, but axed the deal in February after Zendesk shareholders came out against it.
