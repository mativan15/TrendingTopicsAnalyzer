Coffee fans in Shanghai are heading back to Starbucks Corp. locations in that city as the COVID-19 lockdown eases and life tiptoes back to normal. Chinese authorities began to lift a two-month lockdown in Shanghai earlier this week. The lockdown kept residents largely confined to their homes during that period. By the third day of the reopening, Starbucks SBUX, -0.96% had thrown open the doors at nearly 600 of the coffee purveyor's 940 stores in China's largest city. Shanghai has the most Starbucks locations of any city on the globe.
