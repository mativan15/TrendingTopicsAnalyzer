American Airlines is dropping first class on international flights.

In an earnings call Thursday, Vasu Raja, chief commercial officer at American, said"first class will not exist on the 777, or for that matter at American Airlines, for the simple reason that our customers aren't buying it."

He later told CNN he was just referring to international flights. On those flights, the airline will replace them with more business class seats.

The company hinted at this move when it said in September that it was adding premium Flagship Suites for "long-haul" flights.
