(Bloomberg) -- Crime really does pay, at least in crypto.The community of decentralized-finance application Mango DAO on Saturday received a portion of about $100 million stolen by a hacker earlier this week back. The hacker got to keep about $50 million of the stolen funds, no questions asked.The settlement wraps up several days of tense negotiations between the hacker and Mango, which is governed by its community of token holders who vote on any changes. Soon after the theft, the hacker posted a proposal in the app's governance forum asking for bad debts on the platform to be erased -- a deal that was not approved by the majority of Mango token holders even after the hacker voted for it with some of the stolen tokens.
