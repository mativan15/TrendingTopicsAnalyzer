By Australian Associated Press Published: 23:50 EDT, 29 May 2022 | Updated: 23:50 EDT, 29 May 2022 Brisbane prop Payne Haas has rejected suggestions he is money hungry, claiming his contract stand-off with the Broncos is about the length of his deal rather than its value. Haas, who was on Sunday named in Brad Fittler's NSW Origin squad, requested an immediate release last Wednesday from his existing contract, which runs until the end of the 2024 NRL season. The 22-year-old's future at Red Hill has been clouded since he parted ways with his manager, Chris Orr, who had kicked off talks for a new six-year deal with the Broncos last year.
