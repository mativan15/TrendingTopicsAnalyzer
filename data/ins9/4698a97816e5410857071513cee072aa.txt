KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia deported 150 Myanmar nationals this month, including former navy officers seeking asylum, and plans to send back more despite the risk of arrest they face at home, four sources familiar with the matter said.

The deportations come despite Malaysia's condemnation of violence in Myanmar since the military ousted an elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi last year and cracked down on dissent.

Malaysian authorities arrested six former navy officers last month and deported them by plane on Oct.
