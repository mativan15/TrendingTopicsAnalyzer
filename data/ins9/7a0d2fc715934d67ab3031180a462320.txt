For someone who's been writing about the intersection of (or, as I prefer to say, the collision of) media, entertainment and technology for decades, the annual Infinity Festival in Los Angeles can be a bit of a candy store, a chance to survey in one place the bleeding edges of change in all those fields. This year's gathering, the fifth, runs from Nov. 2 to Nov. 5 at the Goya Studios in Hollywood. It will feature some familiar names even for those hopefully mired in traditional entertainment circles: comedian/game show host Howie Mandel, Napoleon Dynamite himself Jon Heder, Bollywood voice of voices A.
