Two local clinicians have formally launched a company offering virtual mental health treatment programs for children and teens as the need for pediatric behavioral health care continues to grow.

Called InStride Health, the company was co-founded in Massachusetts by two McLean Hospital-affiliated clinicians, Dr. Mona Potter and Kathryn Boger, who wanted to provide a virtual solution for more convenient access to comprehensive, evidence-based care for children and adolescents.

Potter, a psychiatrist, and Boger, a psychologist, based their product on their work at McLean, but InStride is an independent company.
