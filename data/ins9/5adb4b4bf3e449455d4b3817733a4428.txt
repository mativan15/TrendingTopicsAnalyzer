Health Canada has approved AstraZeneca's antibody combination Evusheld as a treatment for COVID-19, a decision experts say is 'good news' that will lead to more treatment options in the future.
AstraZeneca Canada said in a press release Tuesday that its Evusheld, a long-acting antibody combination, has received a Notice of Compliance from Health Canada to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 for those aged 12 or older.
Evusheld was approved in April for the prevention of COVID-19 in immunocompromised people.
