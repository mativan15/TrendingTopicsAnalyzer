BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — President Alberto Fernández of Argentina is objecting to allegations by a contestant in the local version of the reality show 'Big Brother' that linked the head of state with corruption. The contestant did not provide evidence to support the allegations.

'If the slander against the nation's president persists,' Fernández 'has instructed me to initiate civil actions for damages against his honor,' Gregorio Dalbón, the president's lawyer, wrote on Twitter Thursday morning.
