New Delhi: Amazon caused the downfall of Limited (FRL) when it could not buy its assets on the cheap, placing FRL now on the brink of bankruptcy, the independent directors of FRL have said. In a reply to Amazon, the directors said in a letter, "Your feigned concern over the state of affairs in FRL is a falsehood and an attempt to gloss over this inconvenient truth." "Your letters are not motivated by the concern or interest of FRL stakeholders, but only as a self-serving act to destroy FRL at any cost," they added.
