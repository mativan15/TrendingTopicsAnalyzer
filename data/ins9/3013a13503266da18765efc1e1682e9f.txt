'Nick's been doing a great job for us and there's no doubt that all of his experience helps in these moments,' Beverly coach Jon Cahill said. 'These guys have been playing together since they were kids. They're not going to shy away from the moment. They rise to it.'Fox, a senior first baseman, is one of three Beverly players who played in the ALWS in Shelby, N.C., last summer — along with second baseman Logan Petrosino and pitcher Noah Guanci — giving the Panthers (14-7) the luxury of postseason experience despite last year's first-round exit to North Andover.
