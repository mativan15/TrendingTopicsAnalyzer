Republican Congressman Mike Garcia and former Assemblywoman Christy Smith, a Democrat, are vying to represent a northern Los Angeles County district that includes Lancaster, Palmdale, Santa Clarita and a sliver of the city of Los Angeles.

The race is one of 10 key California contests in the Nov. 8 midterm election that could determine the balance of power in the House of Representatives. The formerly Republican district has become bluer, as L.A. residents have moved in seeking affordable housing.
