Netflix has dropped a brand new trailer for The Crown season 5 giving the first glimpse at Princess Diana's damning interview with Martin Bashir.
The hotly anticipated series will return next month and will see Dominic West take on the role of King Charles III, Elizabeth Debicki as Princess Diana, and Imelda Staunton as Queen Elizabeth II.  
The two-minute teaser hints at the ‘beginning of the end' as Princess Diana prepares to give her infamous Panorama interview of 1995.
