By PA Media Published: 14:34 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 14:39 EDT, 21 October 2022 A teenager accused of killing four fellow students and injuring several others at a Michigan high school is expected to plead guilty next week, authorities have said. Ethan Crumbley had created images of violence during a classroom assignment last November, but was not sent home from Oxford High School in south-eastern Michigan. He pulled out a gun a few hours later and committed a mass shooting. 'We can confirm that the shooter is expected to plead guilty to all 24 charges, including terrorism and the prosecutor has notified the victims,' said David Williams, chief assistant prosecutor in Oakland County.
