Making ice cream at home is undeniably fun (and saves money) but churning out batches with one of those old-fashioned hand-crank machines loses its luster pretty quickly. An electric ice cream maker is a far more realistic way to go if you plan on using it regularly. Right now, Cuisinart's popular 1.5-quart machine is down to $55 on Amazon -- a full $21 cheaper than we found it anywhere else.While we haven't had the chance to test this Cuisinart model yet, the compact ice cream machine scores high marks on Best Buy, Amazon and other retailers.
