Interlocking design, programmable laser manufacturing and testing for architectured ceramics Tough and impact-resistant ceramic systems offer a wide range of remarkable opportunities beyond those offered by the conventional brittle ceramics. However, despite their promise, the availability of traditional manufacturing technique for fabricating such advanced ceramic structures in a highly controllable and scalable manner poses a significant manufacturing bottleneck. In this study, a precise and programmable laser manufacturing system was used to manufacture topologically interlocking ceramics.
