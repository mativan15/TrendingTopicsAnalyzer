David Paul Morris/Getty Images News Vonage (NASDAQ:VG) dropped 1.8% on a report that the company's sale to Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) could be potentially delayed due to the bribery investigation. Ericsson (ERIC) doesn't know when the U.S. the government's foreign bribery investigation into the company will finish, which could impact the CFIUS review of the transaction, according to a CTFN report. Last Friday Ericsson (ERIC) and Vonage (VG) extended the deal termination date for their combination by three months until Aug.
