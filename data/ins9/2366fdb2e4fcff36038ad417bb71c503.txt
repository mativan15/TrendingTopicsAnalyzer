Former culture secretary Nadine Dorries is guest-hosting on talkTV while Piers Morgan is on holiday next week. Piers fronts his own show, Uncensored, on the channel where he grills and interviews endless guests from Kanye West to self-proclaimed republicans. However, he is understood to be taking a little break from his presenting duties in the upcoming week. In a statement, the Conservative MP said she 'tries to avoid TV these days' but is 'excited' for the opportunity. On October 24 and 25, Nadine will be joined by journalist Emily Sheffield, former Editor of the Evening Standard, to take the reins of Uncensored.
