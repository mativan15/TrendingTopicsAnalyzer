NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday expressed concern over India's high import bill for edible oil, fertilisers and crude oil, and said there is a need to work in a mission mode to make the country self-reliant and reduce import dependence.With international energy prices soaring after the war in Ukraine, India will spend a record Rs 2.5 lakh crore to subsidise fertilizer for farmers. Another $120 billion is spent on importing crude oil and the two together are the biggest drain on exchequer.
