Giancarlo Stanton arrived in New York as a Yankee out of central casting. He had movie-star looks, a Greek god's build, a National League MVP Award and a penchant for hitting baseballs deep into the night. 
It would have been preferable had he shown up as a left-handed slugger to take advantage of the Stadium's right-field porch, but that was a fairly minor detail that could be overlooked. Stanton was supremely talented, and he was supremely tough. He was once hospitalized by a fastball that effectively broke his face, and he got right back into the box as soon as he could.
