There's a brand-new top four in the USA TODAY Sports NCAA Re-Rank 1-131 after a wild weekend highlighted by Tennessee's memorable win against Alabama.

Previously No. 1 in the re-rank, the Crimson Tide fall eight spots to No. 9 after falling 52-49 to Hendon Hooker and the Volunteers. Tennessee continues to soar up the 1-131 and comes in at No. 4, up two spots from last week.

Each of the top three teams gets a one-spot boost. Georgia takes over at No. 1 after annihilating Vanderbilt. Ohio State comes in at No.
