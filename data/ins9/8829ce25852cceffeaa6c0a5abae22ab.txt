Twitter Inc. shares tumbled in premarket trading, falling further below Elon Musk's offer price, on concern the deal may come under government scrutiny. The stock fell as much as 16 per cent to US$43.91, before paring declines, after Bloomberg News reported that the Biden administration is mulling whether the U.S. should subject some of the billionaire's ventures, including the deal for the social media company, to national security reviews. Some U.S. officials may be concerned about foreign investors backing Musk's bid, including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, Binance Holdings Ltd.
