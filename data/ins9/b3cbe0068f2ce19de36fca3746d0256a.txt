Oct 20, 2022 6:37 PM

David Adelman has agreed to purchase a significant portion of the 10 percent stake of the Philadelphia 76ers owned by Michael Rubin. Adelman is a Philadelphia-area native and is also leading development of the Sixers' new arena. Rubin divested his stake in the Sixers and New Jersey Devils due to conflicts of interest with his Fanatics business.
