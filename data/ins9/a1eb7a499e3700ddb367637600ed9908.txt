Rome - Aimed at galvanizing change to how our food is produced, delivered and consumed and mitigating a growing global food crisis, a youth-driven World Food Forum opened here today, seeking to boost engagement by young people, science and innovation, and investment.The multi-faceted event, hosted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), is the second of its kind. It follows last year's path breaking forum which drew 20,000 participants and 75 partners in the search for the best solutions in overhauling global agrifood systems.
