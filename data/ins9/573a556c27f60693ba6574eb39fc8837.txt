The near-term outlook for Pac-12 basketball changed markedly in the final days before the NBA Draft deadline, but not in a one-size-fits-all fashion.
Stanford, USC and Oregon received good news from draft prospects, while Arizona and UCLA were not nearly as fortunate.
Combine draft decisions prior to the June 1 deadline with transfer portal movement over the past few months and the Pac-12 race in 2022-23 has become vastly more interesting.
We expect parity, not dominance, at the top of the conference.
