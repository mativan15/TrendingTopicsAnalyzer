Gopuff is eliminating or re-assessing 22 warehouses across the US, part of a push to operate more efficiently, according to two people familiar with the matter.About half of these warehouses will be shut down while the rest are being re-assessed and could be shut down as well, one of these people said. While the fast-delivery service isn't planning to pull out of any regions, many of the sites set to be shuttered were considered low volume and the company is looking to cut down on extraneous costs.
