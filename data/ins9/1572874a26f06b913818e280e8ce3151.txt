HARD-UP households have just hours left to grab up to £60 of supermarket vouchers amidst the cost-of-living crisis.
The extra support comes as part of the government's Household Support Fund (HSF) initiative, which offers targeted help to struggling homes.

The HSF was first rolled out by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in October last year with a £500million pot to help vulnerable families get through the tough winter period.
