Stormzy has admitted he was ‘scared' to take his Banksy vest home after his performance headlining Glastonbury in 2019.
Performing to a packed crowd at Worthy Farm, he wore the vest which featured the Union Jack.
Initially the grim pioneer had no idea who designed the piece and was naturally stunned when the street artist later revealed that he was the person behind it.
Now, Stormzy has appeared on The Graham Norton Show which airs tonight and has spoken about that mind-blowing moment when it all unfolded.
