The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a plea alleging illegal excavation and construction work by the Odisha government at the famed Shree Jagannath temple in Puri. A vacation bench of Justices B R Gavai and Hima Kohli rejected the PIL with costs, and said the construction activity being undertaken is necessary in larger public interest. The top court said Public Interest Litigation (PIL) other than being in public interest is detrimental to public interest. The apex court said there has been a mushrooming growth in PILs in the recent past.
