Hundreds of people remembered cancer fighter Mike Gilbert in the way he would have wanted, on two wheels. A group motorbike ride set off at 12pm on Sunday from Blenheim to Whites Bay and later gathered at the 5Tapped bar where Gilbert's documentary The Last Ride was shown. Motorcycle enthusiast Gilbert was diagnosed with stage 4 colorectal cancer in December 2019 and died on May 13, aged 45. Gilbert shared his experience with terminal cancer on social media to drive awareness and encourage men to take charge of their own health.
