The Supreme Court's overturning of the landmark Roe vs. Wade abortion decision could motivate more students than usual to cast ballots in the Nov. 8 midterm elections.
But there are challenges younger voters face this year, says Sunshine Hillygus, a Duke professor of political science who studies youth voting patterns. The Karsh Alumni and Visitor Center, one of Durham's early voting sites, is available by bus on the C1 East-West bus. It is the first stop on the C1 going from West.
For same-day registration and voting at Karsh, on-campus students can bring their physical duke card.
