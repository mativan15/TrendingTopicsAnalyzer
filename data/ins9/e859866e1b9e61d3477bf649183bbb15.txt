Oracle Cerner is making headway on its Learning Health Network (LHN), which not only has new cancer treatment implications but opens the door to accessing a more diverse patient population for clinical trials. A goal is to address health inequity and accelerate innovation.

'By design, diversity has become the Learning Health Network's superpower. Clinical trials run through the Learning Health Network have three times the national average of Black and Hispanic participants,' Christy Dueck, Oracle Cerner's vice president of Learning Health Network and Health System Activation, said during the company's health conference on Monday.
