Group firm Hindustan Zinc on Friday reported 32.8 per cent rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 2,680 crore for the September quarter of the current financial year. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 2,017 crore for the year-ago period, said in a filing to the BSE. "Net profit for the quarter was at Rs 2,680 crore...on account of higher zinc volumes and prices, gain from strategic hedging, and favourable exchange rates while being partially offset by the rising input commodity prices and lower lead and silver prices," the company said in a statement.
