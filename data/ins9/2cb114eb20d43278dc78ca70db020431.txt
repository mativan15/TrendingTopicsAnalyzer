With running back Christian McCaffrey on his way to the 49ers for four draft picks, most thoughts about the Panthers are focused on their long-term future.

They still have games to play this season, however, and the next one comes against the Buccaneers this Sunday. The Panthers handed in their final injury report for that game on Friday.

It shows that quarterback Baker Mayfield has been listed as doubtful to play because of an ankle injury.
