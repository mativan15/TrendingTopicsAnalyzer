Eight charities and schools in Wellington and the Chatham Islands are the recipients of a just-under $24,000 donation from Labour's Rongotai MP and failed Wellington mayoral candidate Paul Eagle as part of a pre-election pledge. Eagle, who finished third behind outgoing mayor Andy Foster and winner Tory Whanau in the election, took three months leave from Parliament in July to campaign for mayor and promised to donate his Parliamentary salary for the period to charity. Last week he confirmed that the after-tax amount of $23,994 would be donated to eight organisations.
