Microsoft is building an Xbox mobile store to directly offer games on mobile devices, challenging Apple and Google. The software giant first hinted at a 'next-generation' store it would 'build for games' earlier this year but has now quietly revealed details of the plans in filings with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The CMA is currently investigating the $68.7 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition and has asked Microsoft for context. In its filings, Microsoft says a big motivation for the purchase is to help build out its mobile gaming presence.
