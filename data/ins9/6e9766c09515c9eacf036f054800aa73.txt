It's time for the mane event!
America bands together once again, as a new winner will be crowned as the mullet champion Saturday morning on the Today Show.
Earlier this month, votes were cast to select the top three out of 25 participants in the Men's Open Division for the USA Mullet Champ competition.
With over 20,000 votes cast, three of the hardest hairdos will find out if their luscious locks will be accompanied by a crown and some serious bragging rights. 
Dalton Cleghorn, who describes his wicked mullet as all business in the front and 'straight waterfall, ramen noodle in the back,' is hoping to take home first place.
