After years of declining numbers, the Alaskan snow crab season is canceled.
 
Earlier this month, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) announced that due to low stock, crab fisheries aren't allowed to open for the 2022/2023 season.
 
Miranda Westphal, a biologist with the state's fish and game department, told The New York Times that the state is looking into why the crab population was declining.
 
"From 2018 to 2021, we lost about 90 percent of these animals," Westphal told the outlet.
