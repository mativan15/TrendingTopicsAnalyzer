Netflix announced a new feature on Monday called Profile Transfer after months of testing in a few countries around the world. The feature allows users to move their 'personalized recommendations, viewing history, My List, saved games, and other settings' to a new account, according to the company's press release. There are two reasons this feature exists, only one of which Netflix would probably like you to think about. The first is users who share an account with a roommate, a partner, or their parents, and then eventually, you part ways, but you're still stuck awkwardly staring at their name every time you log in.
