Eric Gilcris got the worst possible news: An aggressive form of brain cancer was likely to kill him, probably within six to 12 months.

One four-word phrase from his neurosurgeon gave Gilcris the hope he needed: 'You fight like hell.'

More than a decade later, Gilcris is still fighting.

The South Burlington man and his wife, Anna Gilcris, founded an organization called Cancer Canknot that raises money to fund cancer research and support cancer patients. The couple presents its sixth Cancer Canknot Golf Classic fundraiser Saturday, June 4, at the Williston Country Club.
