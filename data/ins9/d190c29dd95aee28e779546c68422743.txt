'At the present time, I am keeping a close eye on baser metals. Let us see what happens over the summer driving season and the demand picture going into June and July. I want to see if there are any other major concerns that trigger market sentiment,' says Peter McGuire, CEO, XM Australia.
 
What do you make of this 15% up move that we have seen in crude prices over the last 10-15 days? More importantly do you expect it to be sticky around that $120 mark or do you expect it to taper a bit?I think everyone is gathering their breath because of that huge move to the upside that we have seen, it has been very dramatic.
