Yoon urges swift execution of extra budgetBy Lee Haye-ah SEOUL, May 30 (Yonhap) -- President Yoon Suk-yeol instructed officials Monday to swiftly execute a new 62 trillion-won (US$49.4 billion) extra budget for small businesses hit by the pandemic. Yoon made the remark during a weekly meeting with his senior secretaries, shortly after the budget was approved at a Cabinet meeting following its passage through the National Assembly late Sunday. "It's a great relief that the extra budget proposal passed through the National Assembly," Yoon said during the meeting, reiterating it is the state's responsibility to compensate business owners who suffered under government-imposed coronavirus restrictions.
