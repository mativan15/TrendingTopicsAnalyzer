Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. (NYSE: SKT), announced Monday that its operating partnership, Tanger Properties Limited Partnership, has amended its $300 million unsecured term loan, increasing total capacity to $325 million.

The amended terms extends maturity through January 2027 (plus a one-year extension option), and reduces the applicable pricing margin from LIBOR plus 125 basis points to adjusted SOFR plus 120 basis points based on Tanger's current credit rating.

The amendment also incorporates a sustainability metric, reducing the applicable grid-based interest rate spread by one basis point annually, subject to meeting certain thresholds.
