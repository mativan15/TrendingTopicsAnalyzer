Food banks are facing their hardest winter yet as soaring demand fuelled by the rising cost of living outstrips donations. Leading charity The Trussell Trust, which supports a network of 1,300 food bank centres, today launches an emergency appeal, warning that 'the soaring cost of living is driving a tsunami of need to food banks'.The demand has been particularly acute over the past few months, with the charity distributing 46 per cent more emergency food parcels to banks in August and September compared to the same months in 2021.
