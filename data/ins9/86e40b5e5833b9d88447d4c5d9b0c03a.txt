Passive investing in an index fund is a good way to ensure your own returns roughly match the overall market. Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. For example, the Stride Property Group (NZSE:SPG) share price is down 36% in the last year. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 16%. Notably, shareholders had a tough run over the longer term, too, with a drop of 35% in the last three years. More recently, the share price has dropped a further 14% in a month.
