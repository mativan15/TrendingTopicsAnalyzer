I'm a Google Drive and Google Docs power user. I depend on the service daily to be productive, and given that my modus operandi has been to work as efficiently as possible over the years, not having the standard keyboard shortcuts available in Drive has been a frustration.
Fortunately, Google has finally brought to us those standard keyboard shortcuts we love to use so much. Yes, I'm talking about CTRL+C and CTRL+V for copy and paste. My fingers are so accustomed to hitting those two combinations that I've often found myself cursing at Google for not allowing them to work in Drive.
