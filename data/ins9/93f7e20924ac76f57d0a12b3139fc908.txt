A GoFundMe campaign is aiming to raise funds to recover the remains of actress Megan Hilty's family members who died in a plane crash in Washington last month.

On Sept. 4, a float plane carrying 10 people crashed in Puget Sound, killing everyone on board. Days later, Megan confirmed that her sister Lauren Hilty, brother-in-law Ross Mickel, and their son Remy, were among those dead. Lauren was eight months pregnant with her son, Luca, at the time of the crash.
