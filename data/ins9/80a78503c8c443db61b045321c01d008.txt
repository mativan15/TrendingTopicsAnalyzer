Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari has said it is difficult to make cycle tracks in Mumbai due to space constraints making it impossible to widen roads. He stressed on the practical aspect of the issue saying, "Actually, I am supporting your idea (of cycle tracks). But my practical problem is that in the city area, it is very difficult to increase the width of the road. In Mumbai, we cannot make cycle tracks," Gadkari said during an interactive meeting with institutional investors organised by Philip Capital here on Monday evening.
