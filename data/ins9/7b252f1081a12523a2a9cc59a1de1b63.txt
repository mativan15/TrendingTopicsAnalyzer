The Post experts make their prediction on the Yankees-Astros ALCS series: 
Jon Heyman
Justice denied. The Yankees are strong in most spots, but the Astros seem just a touch stronger. Astros in 7
Greg Joyce
The Astros' well-rested and powerful starting rotation — plus the Yankees' nightly high-wire bullpen act — could be the difference. Astros in 7
Dan Martin
The team that ended the Yankees' chances in the ALCS in 2017 and 2019 will do so again, as the Yankees spent a lot of energy getting by Cleveland and haven't fared well against Astros pitching — which will be well set up, since they haven't played since clinching their ALDS win over the Mariners on Saturday.
