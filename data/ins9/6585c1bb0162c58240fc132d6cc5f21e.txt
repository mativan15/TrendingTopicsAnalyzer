Now the Suns shoot to make it two straight wins on Friday night when they visit the Portland Trail Blazers, who also won their opener. Phoenix trailed the Dallas Mavericks by 22 points in the third quarter on Wednesday before frantically charging back for a 107-105 home triumph. The game had makings of a continuation of last season's Western Conference semifinals when the Mavericks won the final two games by an average of 30 points to send the Suns home early.
