Sen. Tim Kaine said Tuesday that combating sea level rise and improving coastal resilience is not only a climate concern, but a matter of national security.

Kaine, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, called for smart spending with Inflation Reduction Act investments during a talk at the Ocean 2022 conference at the Virginia Beach Convention Center. The conference ends today.

Oceans 2022 is a United Nations-endorsed conference that continues through Thursday for ocean science and maritime professionals to share information and knowledge about research and innovations and to collaborate on projects.
