The New England Patriots came into Sunday's game against the Cleveland Browns as 2.5-point underdogs. And yet, even when faced with the league's best rushing offense and a ferocious defense led by arguably the best pass-rusher in the league, the Patriots still came out on top in Week 6.

And it wasn't even close in the end.

Turnovers told the story of the game with the Browns coughing up four in total. The Patriots in turn made them pay with touchdowns instead of field goals en route to a 38-15 victory.
