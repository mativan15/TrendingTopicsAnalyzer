Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer declined to answer WIRED's questions on how the company's business is changing, the role of advertising in that, or whether ATT was related to its ad plans. 'A user's data belongs to them, and they should get to decide whether to share their data and with whom,' Bauer says. ATT's rules apply equally to all developers, including Apple, he says, and the company 'never tracks users.'That doesn't mean Apple's existing ad revenue won't keep growing. 'It definitely could become a significant part of their business,' says Peter Newman, director of forecasting at Insider Intelligence, who specializes in tracking Apple.
