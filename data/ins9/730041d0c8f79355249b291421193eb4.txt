'The more rooted a story, the more universal it can become,' says actor, writer, and director Rishab Shetty, on how films like his recent hit mystical-mystery Kantarastill work for audiences who may not be aware of its cultural and regional roots. In Kantara, Rishab goes back to his roots in coastal Karnataka to tell a story that unifies nature, humanity, and the divine. Folklore, traditional practices, and regional beliefs take centre-stage, and Rishab's performance as a man possessed by demi-gods Panjurli and Guliga has become a talking point.
