In a bid to expedite slum rehabilitation projects in Mumbai, the country's largest and most expensive property market, the government has decided that all censused and declared slums be termed as slum areas. The government of Maharashtra's Slum Rehabilitation Authority for the city has issued a notification to this effect. There are several slums in Mumbai city and suburban area existing on private lands as well as lands owned by public authorities and this policy decision will be applicable to all of these slums.
