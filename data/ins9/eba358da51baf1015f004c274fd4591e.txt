Mario Tama Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) has always been one of the largest holdings in our portfolio. Whether it is at #1 or #3 depends on the performance of the individual stocks, but it is a fair statement to say it has been a top-3 holding for a very long time. Given that, it is obvious that we notice the performance of Altria when looking at the overall portfolio, even if we don't feel the urge to actually monitor this position too often given the reason (dividends) we hold this stock. Before performing this exercise, we had a hunch that Altria should have outperformed the market in the recent months, and it sure has.
