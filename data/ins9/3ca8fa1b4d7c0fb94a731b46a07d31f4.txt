Terry McLaurin entered the NFL as a third-round pick in the 2019 NFL draft. McLaurin has started 46 out of a possible 49 games in three NFL seasons, recorded 222 receptions for 3,090 yards and 16 touchdowns — with eight different starting quarterbacks.
Now, McLaurin is finally eligible for a new contract that should make him among the highest-paid wide receivers in the NFL. One wide receiver from the outstanding 2019 class, A.J. Brown, already got paid, but not by the team that drafted him.
McLaurin isn't on the trade block.
