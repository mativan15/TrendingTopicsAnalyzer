Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images News Jefferies is a bit more constructive on GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME +6.5%) after digesting the retailer's Q1 earnings report. Analyst Stephanie Wissink and team pointed to progress with increased customer focus, offering depth, competitive pricing and improved fulfillment speed. The cash position was also observed to be healthy enough to withstand the near-term margin degradation. The firm kept a Hold rating in place, but lifted its price target to $110 from $90.
