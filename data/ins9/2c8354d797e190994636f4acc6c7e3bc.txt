Liz Truss's chief of staff still owns a stake in Sir Lynton Crosby's lobbying company despite his Downing Street role, meaning he could benefit financially from the firm's work for corporate clients.Mark Fullbrook, who is in charge of the prime minister's political operation, co-founded the British arm of the lobbying business CT Group with Crosby. Its clients have included the tobacco company Philip Morris, the Saudi Arabian government, and the mining firm Glencore.Fullbrook left CT Group earlier this year but continues to own 10% of its shares, a potential conflict of interest which has not been publicly disclosed since he joined Downing Street.
