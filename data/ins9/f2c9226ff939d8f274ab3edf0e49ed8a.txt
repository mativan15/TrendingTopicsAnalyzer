The five Vancouver neighbourhoods that have seen the largest increases in home values since the onset of the pandemic are all on the east side of the city, according to a new report. City-wide, the average estimated value of homes went from about $920,000 to about $1.4 million, recently released data from Properly shows. That works out to an increase of 18 per cent. But in five east Vancouver neighbourhoods, the rate was far higher. The report doesn't always divide the city into neighbourhoods along the same boundaries as the City of Vancouver, but a map shows how the biggest increases were concentrated east of Main Street.
