Fintech and accounting startup Khatabook is looking to scale up its financial services business. To this end, the startup is doubling down on digital lending, while seeking to widen the subscriber base for its paid software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering. The company is looking to turn profitable in the next 18-20 months. Currently, Khatabook clocks gross revenues of Rs 70 crore on an annualised basis. 'Our journey has been focussed on growth and we wanted to reach as many users as possible,' Ravish Naresh, cofounder and CEO of Khatabook, told ET.
