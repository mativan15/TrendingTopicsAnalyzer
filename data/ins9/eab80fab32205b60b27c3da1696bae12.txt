Asked about LB Willie Gay Jr.'s status back on Monday, Kansas City Chiefs HC Andy Reid gave it a solid, 'We'll see.'
While there were no injuries or anything like that preventing him from seeing the field after four weeks of suspension, Reid wanted to see him work in practice before committing to playing him. He wanted to make sure there wasn't any rust, no conditioning issues and that Gay was playing fast.
