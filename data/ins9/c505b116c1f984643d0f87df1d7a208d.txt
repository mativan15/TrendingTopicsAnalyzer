"Change is constant across every sector and region in our worldwide economy – but getting sellers to change their behavior is notoriously difficult," said Oliver Sharp, Chief Solution Architect and Co-Founder, Highspot. "With the Strategic Enablement Framework, and our technology that supports it, enablement leaders have a powerful combination to unlock rep success in any selling environment." 
Business-to-business sales is undergoing a tidal shift. McKinsey & Company predicts that hybrid selling – while initially an adaptation to the pandemic – will be the dominant sales strategy by 2024, driven by shifts in consumer preferences and remote-first engagement.
