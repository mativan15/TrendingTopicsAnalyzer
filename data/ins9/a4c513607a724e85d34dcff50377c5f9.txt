WASHINGTON, Oct. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The holidays and gift-giving are still more than two months away. October is quickly becoming "Shop-tober," with major retailers wanting to unload summer-season styles and leftover inventory. Several big box retailers and online sellers are enticing consumers to start holiday shopping early, by offering deep discounts, price matching guarantees and relaxed return policies.
As shoppers head to the malls, or before they buy online, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is reminding consumers to put safety at the top of their toy shopping list and is urging manufacturers and consumers to be vigilant, especially when it comes to buying children's toys.
