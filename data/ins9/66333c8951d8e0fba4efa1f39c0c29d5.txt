Ujjain MP Anil Firojiya has claimed he has shed 32 kg of weight in response to a challenge by Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari. Firojiya's weight loss programme kicked in after Gadkari in February taunted him over his girth and publicly promised he would give him Rs 1000 crore for development work in his constituency for each kilo lost. 
"I made a condition for allocating funds to Firojiya ji. Once my weight was 135 kg more than that of Firojiya ji. But now my weight is 93 kg.
