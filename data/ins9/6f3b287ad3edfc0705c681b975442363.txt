Mama June Shannon has officially lost custody of her daughter Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson. US reality TV star Honey Boo Boo, 16, has been at the centre of a heated legal battle between her mother, Mama June Shannon, 42 and her older sister, Lauryn Efird, 22 in recent months. And a judge in Georgia has now granted Lauryn, who also goes by the name of 'Pumpkin', sole custody over Honey Boo Boo, with visitation rights being decided by her too. According to court documents obtained by Page Six, Mama June will be allowed to contact her daughter by phone every day - and she will also have to pay Pumpkin $1100 per month in child support until Honey Boo Boo turns 18.
