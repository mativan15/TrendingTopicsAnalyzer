The author of My Policeman ended up running down the street swearing when she realised what a huge star they'd bagged as their lead man in Harry Styles. 
Bethan Roberts, who wrote the 2012 novel which has been given a film adaptation, admitted she didn't really know much about Harry when he signed up for the movie.
She told Metro.co.uk on the red carpet at the London premiere for My Policeman: ‘I'd be lying if I said I had a total identikit picture of how [the characters] looked. 
‘But I don't know, I'll see how it goes but I wonder if it will be like other films I've seen where I can't now get the actors' faces out of my head [when I'm reading the book.
