By Australian Associated Press Published: 00:21 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 01:11 EDT, 20 October 2022 Work can begin on the expansion of a controversial Queensland thermal coal mine after the state government granted a water licence for the project. Stage three of New Hope Group's New Acland open-cut mine was on Thursday granted a water licence, clearing the final hurdle for work to start. New Hope exhausted its last coal reserves at the site, northwest of Toowoomba, in November and the company has made almost 300 workers redundant since 2019.
