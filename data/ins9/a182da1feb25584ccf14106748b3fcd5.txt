The details leaked yesterday, but today Microsoft made it official—pre-orders are now open for the $599 Surface Laptop Go 2.If you liked the 2020 Surface Laptop Go, then you'll be pleased to hear the second-generation model is more of the same with a performance, battery, and base storage upgrade.The Go 2 uses an 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 with Iris Xe Graphics, 4/8GB of LPDDR4x RAM, and a 128/256GB SSD depending on the model chosen. You may remember the first-gen base model shipped with a 64GB eMMC drive, which Microsoft has thankfully dropped as part of this update.
