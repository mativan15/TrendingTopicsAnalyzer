AgenciesBollywood actress Twinkle Khanna posted a birthday wish for niece Naomika on Instagram, who celebrated her 18th birthday on Thursday, October 19. However, the actor-turned-writer's fans pointed out that Naomika bore a resemblance to her grandmother, Dimple Kapadia, and mother Rinke Khanna. Twinkle's younger sister, Rinke, made her Bollywood debut with the 1999 film Pyaar Mein Kabhi Kabhi. She went on to feature in popular movies like Jis Desh Mein Ganga Rehta Hain (2000), Jhankar Beats (2003), and Chameli (2004).
