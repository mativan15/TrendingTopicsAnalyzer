Gangs of London actor Lucian Msamati, who plays gangster Ed Dumani in the Sky Atlantic drama, has defended the show's epic action sequences.
The first series of the programme, created by The Raid's Gareth Evans, was so violent it broke records for having the most killings on screen.
And, according to the Gangs of London cast and director, season 2, which picks up in the aftermath of the collapse of the Wallace empire, isn't going to hold back.
Filmmaker Corin Hardy promised an even higher body count in the latest instalment in what he hopes will be ‘the most dangerous show on TV', while Marian Wallace actor Michelle Fairley warned it would be ‘violence on steroids'.
