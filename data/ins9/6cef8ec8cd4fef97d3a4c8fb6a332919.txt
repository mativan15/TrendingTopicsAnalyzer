Just because you're looking for a pair of affordable earbuds, it doesn't mean that you have to give up on decent sound. If you're looking for a good pair of wireless headphones but don't want to break the bank, a number of brands are making great options right now that you can get for $100 or less.
Of course, a small pair of buds won't produce the excellent sound quality that our favorite audiophile headphones can, but with built-in Bluetooth, better battery life, as well as more secure ear pieces and no awkward cords in sight, the best wireless earbuds make it easier to listen to your music or podcasts when you're on the go, from your home office to your kitchen and anywhere you're streaming.
