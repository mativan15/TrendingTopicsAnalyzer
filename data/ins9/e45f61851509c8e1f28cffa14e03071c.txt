Brands like Chevrolet from General Motors (GM -2.42%) are about as American as drinking a Coca-Cola at a baseball game, and familiar to all U.S. investors. The name Stellantis (STLA -3.45%) is decidedly less familiar, but it is home to quintessential American brands like Jeep, Dodge, and Ram. Both companies sell some of the most popular vehicles in the U.S., but the stocks of automakers, in general, have had a tough first half of 2022.
The semiconductor shortage has hit production, and rising commodity and shipping costs have been additional curveballs automakers have had to deal with.
