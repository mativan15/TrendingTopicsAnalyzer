Buyers in the market for a new car are now facing several barriers as a result of the continued supply deficit of new and used vehicles for sale, including fewer selections, longer wait times, and higher pricing. Toronto-based Veronica Negro's said her recent experience purchasing a new vehicle to replace her used Honda Civic after a crash was a challenge. She told CTV News that her insurance wasn't able to match the price of her old car, not to mention the limited supply of cars actually available, which led to her having to water down her choices.
