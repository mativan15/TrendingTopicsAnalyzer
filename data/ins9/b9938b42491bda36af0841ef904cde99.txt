The junior becomes the fourth of the original five starters to miss game time.

And then there was one.

The University of Washington secondary, a position area brutalized by injuries this season, lost the fourth of its original five starters when hybrid Husky Dominique Hampton came out in street clothes for warm-ups before the Arizona game.

The 6-foot-3, 221-pound junior from Glendale, Arizona, was one of just two Husky defensive backs to start the first six games.

With Hampton unavailable, only sixth-year senior safety Alex Cook will open each of the first seven games.
