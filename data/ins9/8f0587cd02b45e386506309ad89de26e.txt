Scottish rail travellers face a summer of disruption after train drivers rebuffed a revised pay offer and warned that industrial action was being considered.The Aslef union said its members would have to think about a strike ballot unless talks with ScotRail resume.ScotRail moved under Scottish government control at the start of April but has run into trouble. It had to cut about 700 services from its timetable last month because of the dispute, including running a skeleton service on Sundays and in the evenings.
