Sri Lanka on Saturday received Russian oil in a bid to restart operations in the island nation's only refinery, AFP quoted the country's energy minister Kanchana Wijesekera. The country is facing its worst economic crisis since independence with the people on streets over acute shortage of essentials and fuel since the past 50 days. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, the state-run refinery was shut in March due to the foreign exchange crunch, which left the government being unable to finance crude imports.
