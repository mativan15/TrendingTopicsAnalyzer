The secrets of three 'astounding' Islamic glass fragments discovered at a Scottish castle have been revealed by a 3D digital reconstruction.Since their discovery in the 1990s the origins of the 3cm by 3cm white and blue shards have remained a mystery. They are thought to have travelled from an Arabic-speaking country to the medieval Caerlaverock Castle near Dumfries.Archaeologists believe the fragments formed an Islamic drinking beaker which could have arrived in Scotland through trade or been brought back by returning crusaders.
