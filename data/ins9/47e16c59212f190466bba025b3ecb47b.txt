Investing.com -- The rally in U.K. government bonds ran out of steam on Tuesday after the Financial Times reported that the Bank of England will again delay its plans to sell some of its portfolio of bonds back into the market.

The FT reported that the Bank considers the Gilt market to be "very distressed" after the volatility of the last three weeks, despite an explosive rally in the last two trading days since the new government abandoned its plans for massive and unfunded tax cuts.
