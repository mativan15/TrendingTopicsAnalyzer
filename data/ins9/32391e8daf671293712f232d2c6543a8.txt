It was a day of consolidation for the Indian equity market on Friday as headline index Nifty opened higher but ended up closing with a modest cut. After a positive start, the index ended up marking its high point of the day in early minutes of the trade. As the market maintained the bulk of their gains in the first half, it ended up slowly paring all of those gains. Nifty drifted slowly and by late afternoon trade, it slipped into the negative zone. The modest losses continued to exist until the end; the headline index closed with a modest loss of 43.
