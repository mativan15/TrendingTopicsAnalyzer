Bettors are counting on Jon Rahm to be really good at the Memorial Tournament again.

Rahm enters this weekend's PGA Tour event hosted by Jack Nicklaus as the favorite at +1000. Rahm won the 2020 tournament and was leading by six strokes in 2021 when he had to withdraw because of a positive COVID-19 test.

Rahm is getting the most bets of any golfer at BetMGM, as 8% of the wagers are on him to win the tournament. Those wagers make up just over 14% of the total handle bet on the winner of the tournament; no other golfer is getting more than 9% of the money.
