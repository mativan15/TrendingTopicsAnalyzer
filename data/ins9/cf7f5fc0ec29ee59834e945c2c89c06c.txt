Eilish McColgan's European and British 10k road record will be wiped from the history books after the Great Scottish Run course was found to be 150m short.
McColgan, the Commonwealth Games champion, finished the Glasgow course in first place in 30 minutes 18 seconds on October 2, setting two new landmark records. But more than two weeks on, organisers have been forced to invalidate her results after it emerged the course was not laid out in line with agreed plans, due to a "human error", and fell just short of the distance.
