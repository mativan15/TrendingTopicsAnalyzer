While market movements this year have been excruciatingly painful, especially in the tech sector, these deep divots often represent the best buying opportunities. Zuora (NYSE:ZUO), in particular, continues to stand out to me as a stock with unparalleled rebound potential. Not only are the company's fundamentals getting back on track (Zuora just released Q1 results that showed acceleration in revenue growth, not to mention positive free cash flow), but Zuora continues to trade at deeply discounted multiples after a nearly 50% correction in its stock year to date.
