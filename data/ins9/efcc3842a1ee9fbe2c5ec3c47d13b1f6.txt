Tom Stoppard is one of those playwrights who flatters you with his erudition. His 1993 play 'Arcadia' dives deeply into the mathematics of algorithms and fractals.

His breakthrough 1966 play, 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,' is a graduate school-level midrash — an alternate telling — of 'Hamlet.' You leave the theater feeling smarter, and maybe just a touch self-satisfied, for just having kept up with the dialogue.

It helps that Stoppard has always seemed to thoroughly absorb his interests in science, politics and literature before transposing them into drama and comedy.
