TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Leonard Hamilton has always tried to build and win with veteran teams. This season the Florida State coach will win with a new type of veteran.'We're fortunate now that every one of our returning veterans, our two-year veterans, they have improved with hard work over the summer,' Hamilton said. 'And to my pleasure, the incoming players that we have are farther along than I thought they would be at this stage.'Hamilton and the Seminoles have built rosters through the years that lean on length, athleticism and depth.
