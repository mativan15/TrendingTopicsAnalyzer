Sunday night's penultimate episode of HBO's House of the Dragon was filled with moments that had fans talking online — but few were as surprising as the awkward and intimate one between Ser Larys Strong (Matthew Needham) and Queen Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke).

On Entertainment Weekly's West of Westeros podcast, Clare Kilner, who directed the episode (titled "The Green Council"), shared some insight into how the scene came to be and her feelings on the moment.

In the scene, Larys — who has the literal nickname Clubfoot because he walks with a limp due to a foot that was twisted at birth — makes one of his shady visits to the Queen to share some secrets in exchange for favors.
