Spruce Point Capital Management's attack on Generac couldn't have painted a worse picture of the Waukesha maker of energy technology and other power products.

The New York short selling firm's June news release said Generac is cutting prices, making questionable acquisitions, investing in companies with deceptive business practices, and partnering with distributors who are misleading customers. Oh, and one more thing. Generac's Aaron Jagdfeld -- the CEO who led the company to stock returns of 100% plus in 2019 and 2020 and more than 50% in 2021 -- is unfit to lead and should resign.
