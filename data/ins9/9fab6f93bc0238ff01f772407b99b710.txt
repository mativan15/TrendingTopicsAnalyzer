Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan isn't joining the chorus of those warning about the economy heading into 2023, and that's because the consumer continues to shop, shop, shop despite ongoing inflationary pressures.

"The American consumer is resilient," Moynihan said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above).

According to the chief executive, consumer spending — as measured by transactions on BofA's debit and credit cards — is up 10% through October even as inflation remains high and the economy slows.
