Mumbai: Lenders to Imagicaaworld Entertainment have issued a letter of intent (LoI) to Ahmednagar-based Malpani Group to take over the debt-laden theme park company, bringing the seven-month-old resolution process one step away from completion, said two people close to the development. The LoI was issued on Friday after some last-minute drama when a new bidder made an enquiry in the Swiss challenge round, they said. "A little known US-based investor made an application in the Swiss challenge round and, according to norms, banks gave them a couple of days to deposit ₹15 crore as guarantee, which they could not fulfil, and, as a result, Malpani has been declared the winning bidder," a person involved in the deal said.
