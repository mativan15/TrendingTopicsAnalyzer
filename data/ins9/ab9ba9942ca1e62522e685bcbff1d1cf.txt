The Portland Thorns said Tuesday it will donate a portion of ticket sales from the Oct. 23 National Women's Soccer League semifinal to three local charities.

First reported by the Oregonian, players were able to select the charities and chose Girls on the Run, Girls Inc. and She Flies. A minimum of $100,000 from ticket sales will be donated across all organizations, according to The Oregonian, once the team and game expenses are covered.

This comes in light of the yearlong U.S. Soccer Federation investigation into alleged abuses across the league that found team owner Merritt Paulson knew of alleged, non-sexual abuses by former coach Paul Riley — including verbal abuse and sexism — as far back as 2014, and did not take action.
