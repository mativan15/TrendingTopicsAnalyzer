How much would you pay for a piece of high-tech history? For one collector, the answer was just over $39,000.

That's how much the bidder paid this weekend for a factory-sealed model of the first-edition iPhone — their winning bid topped out at $39,339.60.

The 8GB smartphone was sold by LCG Auctions on Sunday. The device originally retailed for $599 in 2007 — or $852 in 2022 after inflation — and quickly saw its price climb from the opening bid of $2,500 to well into six figures.

"We expected the bidding for this item to be fervent and it did not disappoint as a handful of avid and sophisticated collectors drove the price from just over $10,000 on Sunday afternoon to this record-setting amount by Sunday night," LCG Auctions founder Mark Montero said in a statement.
