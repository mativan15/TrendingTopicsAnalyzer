Dublin, Oct. 19, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Global Consumer Induction Cooktop Market - Forecasts from 2022 to 2027" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.



The global consumer induction cooktop market size was valued at US$11.734 billion in 2020. The induction cooktop is a type of kitchen appliance that uses the technology of an electromagnetic field to transfer heat directly to the metal cookware that is made of ferrous metals. Induction cooktops automatically shut off when the cookware is not present on top of them, making them safer to use as well as energy-efficient as compared to conventional cooktops.
