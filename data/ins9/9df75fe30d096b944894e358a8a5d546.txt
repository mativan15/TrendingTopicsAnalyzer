With recent volatility in the stock markets, Citi has told clients to " buy this dip " while analysts from Bank of America and JPMorgan have named the global stocks and sectors that they believe are trading near a bottom. BofA named a European list of "High Quality stocks that derated the most this year" as its screen of the week in a research note dated May 25. "In our Screen of the Week, we highlight High Quality stocks that have derated more than the market YTD [year to date] but have stronger earnings support and higher-than-sector median FCF [free cashflow]," analyst Paulina Strzelinska said.
