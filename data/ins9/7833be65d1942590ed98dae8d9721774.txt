By PA Media Published: 12:56 EDT, 28 May 2022 | Updated: 12:56 EDT, 28 May 2022 A Florida judge has given initial approval to a settlement of more than 1 billion dollars (£791 million) to families who lost loved ones in the collapse last year of a Florida beachfront complex in which 98 people died. The quick settlement of the unprecedented collapse of the 12-storey Champlain Towers South building in the early hours of June 24 2021 could potentially avoid years of court battles. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Michael Hanzman, who is overseeing the lawsuits filed after the collapse, said during a hearing held remotely it was the best possible outcome given the loss of life and property in the disaster.
