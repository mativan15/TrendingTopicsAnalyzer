Cannabis users in Toronto can now order the drug just as they might order a pizza, by using the delivery app Uber Eats.A partnership between the American tech company and three marijuana dispensaries in the city was launched this week, on the fourth anniversary of Canada's legalisation of the drug.Uber presented its foray into cannabis delivery as a service that would discourage people from driving under the influence, and help legal dispensaries make gains against an illicit marketplace that is still large.
