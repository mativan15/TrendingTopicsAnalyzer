A new system of tagging criminals has ‘wasted' £98m of taxpayers' money, a scathing report from public finance watchdogs has revealed. The Ministry of Justice has been working on £1.2 billion programme to expand tagging to another 10,000 people in the next three years.However, the programme of extending tagging and the introduction of new technology systems to monitor the movements of those tagged has squandered tens of millions of pounds, the Public accounts Committe said. In a report it criticised the 'high-risk and over-complicated delivery model, poor oversight of suppliers, overambitious timetable and light-touch scrutiny from the Ministry of Justice'.
