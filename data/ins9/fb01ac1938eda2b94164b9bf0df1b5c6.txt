MACON, Ga. (AP) — A middle Georgia school system could be among those facing hard choices in coming years as federal COVID-19 relief money runs out. The Telegraph of Macon reports that district officials are warning that declining enrollment means the Bibb County school system will need to close schools to save money in coming years. Chief Financial Officer Sharon Roberts told the school board that of the district's 21 elementary schools, 14 have fewer students than the state's recommended enrollment of 450.
