Supermarket giant Tesco is increasing the price of its popular meal deal. Coming in force next week, shoppers will now have to pay up to £3.90 for a main, snack and drink. The lunchtime combo will now cost £3.40 for Clubcard members - the first increase in a decade - up from the current £3 price. Shoppers without a Clubcard will find themselves paying £3.90. This marks a 40p increase for all Tesco customers. The change is set to kick in from Monday, October 24, reports the Mirror. Despite the increase, the meal deal does save money for shoppers with the most expensive main, snack and drink combination costing £6.
