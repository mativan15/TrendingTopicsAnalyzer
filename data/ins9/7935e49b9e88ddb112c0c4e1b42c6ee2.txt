Amelie Brouillette has some stories of her own about creating the 'New Tales From the Borderlands' video game.
They include diving into performance capture — think upgraded motion capture — on the other side of the country during a pandemic.'We learned a lot. There was a lot of firsts,' said Brouillette, associate producer at Gearbox Studio Quebec in Quebec City.'There was complexity involved. Not all the time but a lot. And each time it was different,' she added.Developed in collaboration with Gearbox Software in Frisco, Texas, 'New Tales From the Borderlands' is the latest spinoff game from the Borderlands series that started in 2009.
