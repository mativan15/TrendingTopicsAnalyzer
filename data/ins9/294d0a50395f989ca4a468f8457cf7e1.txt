Amazon Australia has just kicked off their huge Mid Year Sale for 2022, running from Wednesday June 1, through to Monday June 6 over on amazon.com.au. While it doesn't have the fanfare of Amazon's annual Prime Day or Black Friday sales, there are still some excellent deals to be found, with more rolling out over the next few days. There are some massive savings to be found across a range of great tech, including the standard price reductions on Amazon Echo and Alexa-compatible products that feature in every big Amazon sale, and some phenomenal ASUS deals for all your PC needs.
