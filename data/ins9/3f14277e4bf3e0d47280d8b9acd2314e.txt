Godman and Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who is serving a prison sentence in a Haryana after being convicted for murder and rape, has been granted parole for 40 days – and this coincides with the Adampur bypoll in BJP-ruled Haryana, which is scheduled to be held on November 3. He had conveniently walked out on parole for earlier elections too. Soon after release, in a video message from the sect's Uttar Pradesh ashram on Saturday, he asked his followers to not exercise their free will and follow the directions of the sect's elders.
