ATLANTA — Libertarian Chase Oliver might determine which party takes control of the Senate. But not by winning his election.The long-shot candidate for Georgia's high-stakes Senate race could force a Dec. 6 runoff between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker, reshaping the dynamics of an already close contest and possibly leading to yet another scenario where all eyes focus on Georgia with the Senate majority on the line."I want the voters to know that they do have a third choice in this election," Oliver said in a debate here on Sunday, which Warnock attended and Walker skipped.
