Whether you're looking to entertain company or you're just in search of a laugh on your own, you can prompt your Amazon Echo to say some interesting things. You just have to know the right questions to ask. Give Alexa a break from turning on the TV and playing music. Instead, let your Echo device supply amusing jokes, stories and interesting trivia. For example, Alexa can tell you Star Wars jokes, yo mama jokes and even some interesting trivia facts. Not to mention, it can also keep the kids busy while you're busy.
