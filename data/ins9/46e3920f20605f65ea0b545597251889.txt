By: Liam O'Murchu Women's soccer dropped crucial points in their quest for an A-10 Championship berth on Sunday afternoon in a 2-1 loss to UMass. GW went up 1-0 thanks to a first half goal from graduate student forward Rachel Sorkenn but were undone by two quick UMass goals in the second half. Coming into the match, the Buff & Blue (6-4-6, 1-4-3 A-10) knew they needed a win to keep pace in the race for one of the final spots in the A-10 championship. UMass (5-6-5, 4-2-2 A-10) started the game on the front foot, where they would remain for most of the match.
