'We're not going to get better results until we get better management,' Sen. Elizabeth Warren said.

The enormous challenges at the MBTA fall squarely with the system's top managers, and it's up to the next Massachusetts governor to fix the situation, according to Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

During an appearance on GBH's ' Boston Public Radio ' on Wednesday, Warren said a lack of accountability for top brass at the MBTA and the Department of Public Utilities, which oversees MBTA safety, is the biggest roadblock to improving the T.
