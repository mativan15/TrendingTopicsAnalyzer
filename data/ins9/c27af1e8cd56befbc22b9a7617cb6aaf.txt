Statewide candidates on the Democratic ticket led by Gov. J.B. Pritzker hold commanding cash advantages over Republicans ahead of next month's general election, state records for the year's third quarter show.

Democrats continued to benefit from the largesse of Pritzker, a billionaire entrepreneur and Hyatt Hotels heir who gave $1 million each to his party's candidates for secretary of state, Alexi Giannoulias, and attorney general, Kwame Raoul, in September.

But Democrats also showed a broader base of financial support than Republicans.
