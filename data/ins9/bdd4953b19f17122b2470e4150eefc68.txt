Amid extraordinary scenes at Westminster, one Tory MP was 'physically manhandled' into the 'no' lobby to ensure he opposed the motion, according to opposition MPs. Mr Rees-Mogg, the Business Secretary, insisted he had seen no evidence of anyone being manhandled and there had simply been a 'normal' discussion among MPs as they prepared to vote.
