Mayoral candidate Kevin Klein says if he is elected Winnipeg's next mayor he will make the city a safer place and immediately address the homeless crisis without raising taxes any further. "We're fractured right now," said Klein.  "We've had a number of problems, especially over the last eight years. We've ignored a lot of problems and its time to get to work on those problems … so that we can return to that city that had bustling streets that people wanted to visit from across the world." On the issue of crime and safety, Klein said he has been trying to address the problem for years now as city councillor.
