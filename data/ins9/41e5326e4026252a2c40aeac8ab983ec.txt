Stray Kids are back at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, but not with their recent champion. The South Korean boy band debuts their new EP Maxident, which opens in first place on the tally with 117,000 equivalent units shifted. The bulk of that figure–110,000 copies–are pure sales, which shows that fans of the group are eager to open their wallets and purchase anything released by the outfit. Maxident is Stray Kids' second No.
