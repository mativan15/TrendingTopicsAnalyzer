New Zealand's 26 provincial rugby unions are in the process of putting their mouths where their money could soon be. New Zealand Rugby's constituent unions have gathered in Auckland on Thursday at a special general meeting to vote on the proposed Silver Lake private equity investment proposal. The meeting was scheduled to start at 12pm, with a decision expected by mid-afternoon. It is the final vote in a two-year process that has dragged on amid considerable acrimony, discontent and allegations from all parties within the game in this country, possibly reflective of the significant sums involved and the historic nature of the investment.
