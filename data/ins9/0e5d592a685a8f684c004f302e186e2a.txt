The proposed global information-sharing framework for crypto assets doesn't provide legitimacy to digital currencies and does not take away sovereign freedom to impose bans, an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) official told ET.The OECD presented a framework for reporting crypto assets to the G-20 finance ministers in Washington last week. The think-tank is expected to soon start the implementation process for the proposed Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF).The plan for a global information-sharing arrangement follows growing concerns worldwide over opacity in transactions in crypto assets and a lack of regulatory oversight of intermediaries dealing in them.
