In their handful of conversations thus far, Brian Daboll hasn't yet asked former Giants coach Tom Coughlin the secret to lasting in New York. 
If he does, Coughlin's advice wouldn't surprise anyone. 
'Win,' Coughlin said Friday night during a break from his hosting duties at the Tom Coughlin Jay Fund Foundation in Midtown. 
Coughlin needed to win the regular-season finale in 2006 and sneak into the playoffs to avoid getting fired with a winning record after three seasons. He went on to win two Super Bowls before he was forced into retirement in January 2016, after four straight non-playoff seasons.
