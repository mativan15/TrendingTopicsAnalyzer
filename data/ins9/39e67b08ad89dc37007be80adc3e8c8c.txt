Consumer groups have written to the corporate regulator, asking it to mount a full investigation into whether civil or criminal action can be pursued against people involved in Youpla, a funeral insurance group that has collapsed leaving at least 13,000 Indigenous people without coverage.In a letter to the chair of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, Joe Longo, the groups also ask that the regulator continue a court case against Youpla, alleging it engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct, even though the group has collapsed.
