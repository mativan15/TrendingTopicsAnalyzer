Oakland-grown developer Riaz Capital says its frustrations with the city have prompted its entrance into new Bay Area markets.

The developer recently proposed a pair of projects totaling more than 300 homes in Berkeley, marking the first time it has gone outside of Oakland with its affordable-by-design development strategy, which emphasizes efficiency and thus affordability. Founder and CEO Riaz Taplin, who in mid-October joined Oakland business leaders to call on elected officials to lead revitalization efforts in downtown Oakland, says he has grown increasingly concerned about issues like public safety and cleanliness over the course of the last two to three years.
