Government plans to impose a so-called 'latte levy' of at least 20 cent on disposable paper coffee cups, before eventually banning them altogether, are facing a campaign of resistance from coffee shop owners, cup manufacturers and industry lobby groups, who claim it will damage business and be counterproductive for the environment.The levy is one of a number of environmental measures in the Government's Circular Economy Bill, which has been approved by Cabinet and is expected to become law before the end of the year.
