Iowa governor candidates Kim Reynolds and Deidre DeJear offered starkly different visions on tax policy, education funding and ― during a heated exchange ― abortion during an hour-long debate Monday night.

Reynolds, a Republican who's seeking her second full term as governor, touted what she said has been steady fiscal and state leadership over her past four years. DeJear said Reynolds and Iowa's Republican administration are touting tax cuts and the state's nearly $2 million surplus while underinvesting in areas such as education and health care.
