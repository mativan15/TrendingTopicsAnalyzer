The Chinese military commander also carried the 2022 Winter Olympic Games torch held in Beijing.While President Xi Jinping, soon to be elected as China's paramount leader for the third time, showcased the bloody skirmish at Galwan to flaunt the military prowess of the nationalistic PLA, it also deliberately identified democratic India as a principal adversary of the Communist dictatorship.
