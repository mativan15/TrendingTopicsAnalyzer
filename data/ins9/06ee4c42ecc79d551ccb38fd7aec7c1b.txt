On Thursday The Ministry of Education announced that the government will be offering parents $200 or $250 per child to help offset the cost of catching up in school after two years of disrupted learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents with children in Kindergarten up to 18 years old can apply for $200, while parents with school-aged children with special education needs, up to 21 years old, can apply for $250. "I think that it's important to provide that funding I just think that saying this is the set amount for every student, I don't agree with that," said Yvonne Martin, a mother of two in London.
