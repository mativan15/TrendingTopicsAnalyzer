Steven Gerrard says he hopes to 'fight and lead' Aston Villa through a difficult period and insists there is 'no one on the planet' more determined to do so.The Villa boss has overseen a worrying run of one win in seven league games, leaving Villa 16th in the Premier League.Asked if he is drawing on the character he showed as a player in testing times, Gerrard said: 'I've had tough days. But tough days are OK because you need to use them as motivation for when better days come. I'm a young manager, I take that and this is a tough period.
