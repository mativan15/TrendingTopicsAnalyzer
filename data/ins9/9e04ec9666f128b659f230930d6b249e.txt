Tim Boyle/Getty Images News Wells Fargo said a definite shift in retail spending trends was observed in its latest survey of consumers. The firm said the percentage of consumers who are stepping up hardlines spending ticked down to 83% from 94% in February. Analyst Zachary Fadem said the results suggested post-pandemic gains for hardlines, while still strong, have notably faded in recent months. 78% of consumers in the survey indicated that they have either cut back or plan to cut back on hardlines spending in response to inflation, which marked a notable increase since February.
