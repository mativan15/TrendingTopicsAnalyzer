Millennia have passed since humans discovered silk and began harvesting it from silkworm cocoons, but scientists are still finding new uses for this remarkable material. Now researchers say it could help tackle a growing environmental and health concern: microplastics, the minuscule plastic fragments that have been found everywhere from mountaintops to the seafloor—and even in the human bloodstream. Most environmental microplastics form when larger items degrade. But a smaller yet notable portion of the polluting particles is deliberately added to products, according to a report from the European Chemicals Agency.
