Jun. 5—Between rising rents and grocery bills, an unpredictable stock market and fresh pain with every trip to the gas pump, it's hard to feel economically secure and optimistic, even as unemployment remains at record lows.

In a survey released last week, New Hampshire residents — especially low- and middle-income Granite Staters — reported feeling worse off than they did a year ago and predicted things will only be worse in another year.

Almost one in three respondents to the BIA Report on Consumer Confidence, conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, said they thought things would get worse for businesses in New Hampshire over the next year.
