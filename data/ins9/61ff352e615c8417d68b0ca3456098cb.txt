Jun. 3—SOUTHERN INDIANA — Though no money has officially been allocated toward READI projects, Our Southern Indiana Regional Development Authority (RDA) did approve a funding plan on Friday to disperse the federal funds.

Our Southern Indiana submitted $85 million worth of projects for its Regional Economic Acceleration and Development Initiative (READI) application but was awarded the maximum amount of $50 million.

The group was left with the challenge of determining how much funding each of the submitted projects will receive.
