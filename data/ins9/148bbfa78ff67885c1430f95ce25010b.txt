Sebastian Vettel has explained what happened when his backpack was stolen outside his hotel after the Spanish Grand Prix.

The four-time former World Champion had the backpack pinched through a car window and upon realising, set off on a scooter to try and track down his belongings.

The Aston Martin driver knew he could locate his headphones via a tracking app and found them after they had been dumped, but unfortunately was not reunited with any of the other stolen property.
