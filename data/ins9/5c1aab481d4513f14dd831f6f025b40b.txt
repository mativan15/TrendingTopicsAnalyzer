Xi Jinping's speech Sunday at the Chinese Communist Party Congress, poised to make him president for life, marks Beijing's final return to aggressive totalitarian rule.
The West hoped that admitting China into the global economy would mellow the CCP. Nope. 'China's international influence, appeal and power to shape the world have significantly increased,' Xi bragged, warning of 'dangerous storms ahead.'
In other words, Beijng will use its new wealth, and the military it allows, to press its claims to independent, free Taiwan and across the South China Sea.
