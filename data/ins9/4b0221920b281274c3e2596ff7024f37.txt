Just_Super/E+ via Getty Images II-VI Incorporated (NASDAQ:IIVI) has aggressively expanded its leadership position in its most relevant markets, while maintaining a relatively healthy balance sheet and securing its market share in secular growth trends. The company is anticipated to close the acquisition of Coherent in the short term, as it waits for the Chinese antitrust regulator to give its consent. II-VI has an outstanding growth potential in its end-markets, such as communication with the adoption of 5G and increasingly demanding technology in data centers, in the automotive industry with the emergence of self-driving cars and electric vehicles, or in the consumer electronics market, with augmented and virtual reality applications as well as 3D sensing.
