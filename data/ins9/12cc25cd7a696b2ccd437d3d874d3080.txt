Shay DiddyBy @ShayDiddyOct 19, 2022It looks like Atlanta has their own version of 'The Tinder Swindler' allegedly. Women in Atlanta are coming forward to blast a man named "Doc Will" for allegedly scamming them out of thousands of dollars! Women claim he charmed them in friendships, then he would ask them to invest into his businesses like a night club, trucking company or a marijuana company. They claim once they invested their money with him, he would then go ghost! Now, the women are looking into their legal options to try and get their money back.
