The grip that The Great British Bake Off has on the nation is truly a wondrous phenomenon, filled with fluffy sponges, soggy bottoms and beautifully-snapping biscuits.
The show is now expanding into the realm of the theatre, with an official musical inspired by the Channel 4 programme making its way to London's West End.

The famous Bake Off tent will be setting up camp at the Noël Coward Theatre in the English capital – and there isn't long to wait until the show begins its run.
