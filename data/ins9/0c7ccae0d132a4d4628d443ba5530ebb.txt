As Calgarians put the finishing touches on their costumes, a new report suggests that Canadians are expected to spend 28.4 percent more on Halloween this year than they did last year. The report from HelloSafe, released last week, equates that to about $87.60 per person, which is still less than the $97 Canadians were dropping before the pandemic.  The report finds costumes will be the largest expense, averaging around $41.50 or nearly half of a person's budget for the spooktacular day.  Canadians will also be spending an average of $22.
