Every year tens of thousands of youths age out of the U.S. foster care system. In 1995, I became one of them on my 18th birthday. I was just two months into my freshman year at the University of Pennsylvania. I was focused on navigating a new learning environment in a new city I had just moved to, sight unseen, where I knew no one. I recall no pomp and circumstance around my birthday that year. All I remember was the clock striking midnight and suddenly I was 18, vacillating between tears and pure happiness.
