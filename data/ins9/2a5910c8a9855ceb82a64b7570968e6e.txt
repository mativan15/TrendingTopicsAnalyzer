There were two types of reaction in Government to the news this week that 135 Ukrainian women and children were to be bussed out of Killarney to Westport with next to no warning.The first type of reaction was voiced by the likes of the Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys and Fine Gael TD Fergus O'Dowd, both of whom described it as 'unacceptable'. They made these comments after a last-minute scramble which saw the refugees told they could remain where they were, except in different accommodation.
