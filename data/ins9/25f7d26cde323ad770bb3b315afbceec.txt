Events marking the Queen's Platinum Jubilee have drawn some criticism given their timing amid a cost of living crisis. Writer Yasmin Alibhai-Brown claimed in the i that many Britons are 'dismayed and incensed by the scale and profligacy' of the celebrations.Anti-Brexit campaigner Femi argued that, because Britons are struggling with costs, the Royal Family should have offered to pay for the occasion 'out of our own private fortunes'.He wrote in a post on Twitter: 'Can you imagine if the Royal Family said: ‘Because people are literally starving right now, we're going to pay for the PlatinumJubilee out of our own private fortunes and give all the cash that would have been spent on us, to the poorest councils in the UK'?'What a wild gesture!'Many on the platform were quick to hit back, insisting the celebration was value for money and would, in fact, bring more money in.
