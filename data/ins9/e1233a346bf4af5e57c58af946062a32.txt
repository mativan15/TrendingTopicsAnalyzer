The 37-year-old was hauled off with 18 minutes remaining and his side still searching for a goal that would have broken the deadlock.
Ronaldo was clearly annoyed with his manager's decision as he trudged towards the dugout before being replaced by Marcus Rashford.
Explaining the change in the immediate aftermath of the game, Ten Hag said: ‘We have to cover four games in 10 days, and especially for the strikers I want to keep them fresh,' said Ten Hag.
