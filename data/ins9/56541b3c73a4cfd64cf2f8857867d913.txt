UK Prime Minister Liz Truss, who is being targeted in British tabloids for handling of pressing issues, has apologised for going 'too far and too fast' with tax reforms – the plans for which were junked by her newly-appointed chancellor Jeremy Hunt, which had caused investor confidence to dip. In an interview with the BBC, Truss apologised for her mistakes, saying her month-old leadership 'hasn't been perfect' but she had 'fixed' the errors.'I'm sticking around because I was elected to deliver for this country, and that is what I'm determined to do,' the UK PM vowed.
