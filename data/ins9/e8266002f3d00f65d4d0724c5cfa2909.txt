OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Many of the top seeds and familiar teams will be absent when the Women's College World Series starts Thursday.Oklahoma coach Patty Gasso believes those are good reasons for her top-seeded, defending national champion Sooners to be concerned heading into their opener against No. 9 seed Northwestern. Florida State, Virginia Tech, Arkansas and Alabama are top six seeds that didn't make it to Oklahoma City. Gasso said that means there are more teams left that overcame the odds on the road to qualify.
