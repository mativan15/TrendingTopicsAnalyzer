Climate protesters threw red paint over the front of Queen Elizabeth House, the UK government's offices in Edinburgh, after the Jackdaw gasfield was awarded final regulatory approval.Activists held up banners saying 'Just Stop Oil' and 'blood on your hands' at a demonstration outside the building yesterday. Environmental campaigners have threatened legal action against the plans in an attempt to halt the field's development. Greenpeace insisted that by giving it the green light the government had 'shown no regard' for emissions or the 'ultimate climate impact'.
