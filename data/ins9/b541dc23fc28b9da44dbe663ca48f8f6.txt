Families in the UK are facing average energy bills of up to 5000 pounds (NZ$10,050) from April after Britain's Prime Minister Liz Truss was forced to rip up her government's entire economic strategy and issue a public apology to the nation. Jeremy Hunt, the new chancellor of the exchequer, said Monday (local time) that the energy price guarantee which limits average energy bills to pounds 2500 (NZ$5026) will come to an end in April. Support will then be targeted at the most vulnerable in a move that could see bills for most families double.
