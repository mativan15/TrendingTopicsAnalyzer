KETCHIKAN, Alaska (AP) — The state of Alaska has sold the ferry named Malaspina to a business group in a deal aimed at giving the ship a new life and preventing it from being scrapped.The Malaspina, built in 1963, was one of the original ferries in the state's ferry fleet. It was moored in late 2019 after the state transportation department said the vessel wouldn't sail as part of the fleet again because of its age and the cost of needed repairs. Businessmen John Binkley and David Spokely on Wednesday signed paperwork to buy the ship for $128,250, the Ketchikan Daily News reported.
