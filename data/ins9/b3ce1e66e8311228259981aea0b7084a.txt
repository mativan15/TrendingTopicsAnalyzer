LoadingCannon-Brookes will clearly want the AGL board to accept his request for two board positions, and has already got a list of preferred candidates drawn up. But interestingly, he is not asking for either of his nominees to be the chairman, and is happy for that role to be taken by an independent.It seems likely the names of his candidates will be handed to Botten and Sullivan at this week's get-together.What is more difficult to assess in this muddy governance situation is who has the balance of power.
