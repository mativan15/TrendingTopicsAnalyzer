The UK's economic outlook has been downgraded from 'stable' to 'negative' by the ratings agency Moody's due to political instability and high inflation.

In a report published on Friday night, Moody's said the change in outlook was driven by 'heightened unpredictability in policymaking amid weaker growth prospects and high inflation' and 'risks to the UK's debt affordability from likely higher borrowing and risk of a sustained weakening in policy credibility'.
