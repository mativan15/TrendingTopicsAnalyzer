(RTTNews) - The Australian stock market is modestly lower on Monday, giving up the gains in the previous session, with the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 falling just below the 7,200 level, following the broadly negative cues from Wall Street on Friday, with weakness in technology, materials and financial stocks partially offset by gains in energy stocks amid rising crude oil prices.

Traders also remain cautious ahead of Reserve Bank of Australia's interest rate decision on Tuesday. The RBA is widely expected to continue raising interest rates to tame ballooning inflation.
