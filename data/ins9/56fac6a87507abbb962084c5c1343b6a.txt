SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has admitted that his efforts to de-escalate the Russia-Ukraine conflict have failed. The comments came as he discussed the risks of nuclear war on Twitter with tech entrepreneur and the former head of Megaupload, Kim Dotcom.The dialogue happened as officials and experts in both the West and Russia have been weighing in on the possibility that the bloodshed in Ukraine could lead to a larger and even more destructive conflict.'The hell with it … even though Starlink is still losing money and other companies are getting billions of taxpayer [dollars], we'll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free,' Musk tweeted on Saturday.
