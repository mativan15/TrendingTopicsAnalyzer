Good morning. Liz Truss finally did something half-sensible last night and apologised for the problems caused by the mini-budget. It is not clear yet what, if anything, this will do to improve her survival prospects, and in her interview with the BBC's Chris Mason she also said that she would 'lead the Conservatives into the next general election'.

In normal circumstances, this would be a mistake, because fighting an election with her as leader is the last thing that Tory MPs want, and unpopular prime ministers who insist that they want to 'go on and on' normally only incentivise those plotting to get rid of them.
