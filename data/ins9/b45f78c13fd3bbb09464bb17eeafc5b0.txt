In 2007, Brad Shreve was a stripper, and a good one too. 
With his Adonis-like looks and party-boy charm he quickly earned enough to buy his dream house on the beach. 
He spent his days building beautiful bamboo furniture out on the veranda, then nights dancing in clubs until dawn. ‘I was completely outgoing, a total extrovert,' he tells Metro.co.uk, laughing. ‘I was hot and cocky.'
In fact, he was so confident that he even bought a blimp to fly about in, emblazoned with his own face. 
If Brad's extravagant life seems too good to be real, that is because it wasn't.
