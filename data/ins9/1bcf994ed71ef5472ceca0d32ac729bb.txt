Zach Wilson is 3-0 as a starter. That puts him in rare company; the only other undefeated quarterbacks in the league right now are Jalen Hurts and, uh, Bailey Zappe.
Granted, he didn't do much to beat the Packers — 18 passes, 110 yards — but his downfield strike to Corey Davis was instrumental in breaking a 10-10 tie and setting the stage for a runaway win. A week earlier, he completed 14 of 21 passes for 210 yards for another decisive victory, this time against AFC East rival Miami.
