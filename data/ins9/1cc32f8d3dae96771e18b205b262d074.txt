The Bihar Health Services Association (BHSA) on Wednesday joined issue with the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to question deputy chief minister and health minister Tejashwi Yadav's statement that 705 government doctors in the state have been drawing government money while being absent from work for more than six months. BHSA, a forum of government doctors from the level of additional primary health centre to the district hospital, said the minister may have been provided with half-baked information on the issue.
