Apple just unveiled the Apple TV 4K (2022), which features a more powerful chip, a smaller design, HDR10+ support for the first time, and a new lower price of $129 / £149 / AU$205.It also includes an update to the Siri remote, the latest version of which was introduced with the Apple TV 4K (2021): the remote now charges over USB-C instead of Lightning.This is welcome (I can now charge it from the same cable I use for my PS5 controllers), but it's not the Siri remote upgrade I hoped for.
