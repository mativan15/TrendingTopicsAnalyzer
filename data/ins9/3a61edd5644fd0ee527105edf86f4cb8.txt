Amazon's Black Friday game increases the N.F.L.'s Thanksgiving offering.

The league said it would play a game on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, for the first time, in 2023, after it reached an agreement with Amazon to stream the game.

The one-year deal will expand professional football's hold on the Thanksgiving holiday, increasing the schedule to four games in about 24 hours from Thursday to Friday. It will also help Amazon raise its profile on one of its slower sales days of the year, a commercial bonanza more associated with brick-and-mortar retail than e-commerce.
