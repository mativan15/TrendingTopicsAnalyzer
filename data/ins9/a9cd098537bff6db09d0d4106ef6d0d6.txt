According to Capcom, however, there are currently no plans to remake the 2000 Dreamcast title.Speaking to Noisy Pixel, Resident Evil 4 producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi said Capcom's current focus is currently on Resident Evil 4, but if the "opportunity comes, maybe" the company will remake Code Veronica.
