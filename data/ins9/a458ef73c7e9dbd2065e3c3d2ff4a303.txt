A day after C N Ashwath Narayan, Karnataka's minister for IT, Electronics & Skills Development, came down heavily on the trend of moonlighting in the IT companies and created a flutter, Wednesday he clarified that his comments were taken out of context by the media and the 'headlines were sensationalised'.
This came a day after media reports quoted Narayan as referring to paid freelancing beyond office working hours as 'cheating' and said that professionals wanting to do so 'should shift out of Karnataka'.
