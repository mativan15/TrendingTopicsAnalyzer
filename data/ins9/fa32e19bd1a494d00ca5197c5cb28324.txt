Obviously, it's iconic enuff [sic]. ""But too bad they went all white! No Latinx in the leads! Groundbreaking colour-blind casting in original! Plus I'm the only one who knows how to make this movie work script-wise!" he added.Leguizamo also shared photos of himself playing Luigi and Bob Hoskins as Mario in the original film, which was released in 1993.
