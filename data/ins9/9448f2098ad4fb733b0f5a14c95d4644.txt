Billboard Magazine recently ranked Drexel University's Westphal College of Media Arts and Design alongside the Berklee College of Music, New York University and the University of Southern California as one of the world's top schools for music business.

The list includes 36 colleges in no specific order. For Jeff Apruzzese, who heads up the music industry program, it's validation that Drexel belongs among schools long known for their prowess in the industry.

"Seeing our program alongside some of the programs that have been long-recognized as historically good music business programs, I think that kind of just makes us all feel over here that the program that we are trying to put together and continue to grow is being recognized as something that is not necessarily just regional anymore," said Apruzzese, who was the bassist for indie pop band Passion Pit and is a graduate of the Berklee College of Music in Boston.
