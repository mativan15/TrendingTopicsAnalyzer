ReutersRepresentative photoThe current wave of Covid-19 infections in Singapore is being driven by the XBB sub-variant and is likely to peak at an average of 15,000 daily cases by mid-November, the government said on Saturday. However, projections based on previous waves of infection show that Singapore has adequate healthcare capacity to cope with the rise in the coronavirus cases, the health ministry said. 
 In Singapore, XBB is now the predominant subvariant, accounting for 54 per cent of local cases from Oct 3 to 9, the Channel News Asia reported.
