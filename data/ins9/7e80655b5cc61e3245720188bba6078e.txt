(RTTNews) - European stocks rose for a fourth straight session on Tuesday after the United Kingdom government reversed nearly all the tax cuts and a survey showed German economic sentiment improved in October. Regional markets, however, came off their day's highs after the Bank of England disputed a report that it will further delay its quantitative tightening program.
The pan European Stoxx 600 was up 0.4 percent at 400.13, extending gains for a fourth day. The German DAX climbed 1.2 percent, France's CAC 40 index added 0.
