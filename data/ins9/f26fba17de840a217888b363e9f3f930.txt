Despite this year's consistent decline in stock prices, with all three major indices falling into a bear market, there's still an upside case to be made for stocks.That's according to DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas, who told clients in a Tuesday note that a combination of factors, including a peak in inflation and interest rates, could drive stocks higher heading into 2023."Cautious as we are about the near-term direction of US/global equities, it always pays to consider the other side of the trade," Colas said, adding that the market typically looks six months out when pricing securities.
