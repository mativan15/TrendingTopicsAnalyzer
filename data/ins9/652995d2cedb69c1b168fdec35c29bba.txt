U.S. stock-indexes opened slightly lower Friday, on track for a three-day losing streak as Treasury yields continue to march higher on expectations for aggressive Federal Reserve rate increases. Indexes, however, were on track for weekly gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.13% fell 52 points, or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.19% was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.40% shed 0.4%. All three major indexes were on track for weekly gains of more than 2%.
