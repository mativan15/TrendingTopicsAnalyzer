A state senator representing Uvalde, Texas, says President Joe Biden indicated a willingness to provide federal money to raze Robb Elementary School and build another in its place following the shooting there.

Texas state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat, said Biden floated the idea of federal grants for building a new school and paying for long-term health care needs in the community when he visited the grieving community this weekend.

'He said, 'I'm not going to leave here, we're gonna bring resources, we're gonna look at bringing a federal grant to raze the school,'' Gutierrez said Monday on MSNBC.
