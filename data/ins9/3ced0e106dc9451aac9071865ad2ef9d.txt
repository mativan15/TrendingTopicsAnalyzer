The education secretary had to be escorted off a campus by security staff after trans rights activists stormed a meeting he was attending.
Nadhim Zahawi was giving a talk at the University of Warwick when protesters waving placards burst into the building.
Dozens of people chanting ‘Tory scum' cut the event short, which had been organised by a student Conservative association. 
One eyewitness told The Telegraph a Tory attendee was struck on the head by one of the mob.
Prior to Mr Zahawi's attendance, Warwick Pride issued a statement accusing him of playing a ‘significant role in institutional transphobia'.
