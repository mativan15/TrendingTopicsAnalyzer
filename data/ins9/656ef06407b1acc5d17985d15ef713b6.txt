Former Penn State defensive coordinator Brent Pry continues to assemble his first football staff since becoming the head coach at Virginia Tech. The newest addition to his staff in Blacksburg has a bit of a Penn State flavor to it.

According to Rich Scarcella of The Reading Eagle, former Penn State linebacker Jan Johnson is joining the Virginia Tech program as a defensive analyst.

Johnson had been trying to keep his professional football career going with the USFL after a brief taste of the NFL in the last two years.
