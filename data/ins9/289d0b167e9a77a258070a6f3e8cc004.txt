Anna Bliokh/E+ via Getty Images Cryptocurrency platform BTCS (NASDAQ:BTCS) said Tuesday that it has made a $100K investment in GlobexUS Holdings, the parent Horizon Globex GmbH, which is the operator of Upstream, a regulated securities exchange developed on the ethereum (ETH-USD) blockchain. The blockchain-focused move could allow BTCS (BTCS) to tokenize or list their securities for trading on an exchange, it said. Furthermore, Upstream's trading app enables the ability to pay dividends directly to a holder's wallet, which could reduce friction of BTCS (BTCS) shareholders' so-called Bividend.
