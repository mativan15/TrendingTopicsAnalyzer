Time is money, and it is crucial to accelerate road construction to improve the accessibility and connectivity of infrastructure. Prolonged periods of project implementation lead to delays and cost overruns, and further delays could destabilize the construction industry, causing an economic slowdown. This study explores the causes of delay in giving site possession, a topic that has received little explicit attention. The authors qualitatively identified the causes of delayed site possession from 15 project case studies.
