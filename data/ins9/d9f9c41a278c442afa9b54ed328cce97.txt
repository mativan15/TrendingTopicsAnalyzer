On a 4-3 vote, a new mixed-use project that could bring millions of new square feet for industrial use will move to Gilbert Town Council.

Gilbert Planning Commission recommended approval of the project, called The Ranch, on Thursday, according to Dan Henderson, Gilbert's economic development director.

The Ranch would be developed on more than 300 acres mostly on the southwest corner of Elliot and Power roads. Most of the proposed development will be industrial space with more than 3.5 million square feet across 16 buildings.
