While multi-night, competing reality cooking shows might be your idea of viewing heaven or hell, at least June offers a whole host of alternative options for those who can't stomach hours upon hours of food porn. As well as the introduction of MasterChef Australia to TVNZ 2 from June 12, the state broadcaster also has a two-part series on te ao Māori, Hongi To Hāngī: And Everything In Between (June 14, TVNZ 2) and the return of panel show Give Us a Clue (June 15, TVNZ 1), while Three has new seasons of the much-admired Match Fit (June 8) and the Guy Williams-hosted New Zealand Today (June 9).
