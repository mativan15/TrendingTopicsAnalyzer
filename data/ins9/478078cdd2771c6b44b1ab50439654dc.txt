The star forward faced disciplinary action from the club after refusing to enter Wednesday's match against Tottenham.

Hours after Manchester United announced that Cristiano Ronaldo would be removed from the first team following his refusal to enter Wednesday's game against Tottenham, the star forward has offered a public response.

Ronaldo, who has only started twice in the team's 10 Premier League contests this season, said in an Instagram post that he would continue to work hard at the team's training grounds at Carrington and support his teammates from afar.
