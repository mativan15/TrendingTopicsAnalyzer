The nature of investing is that you win some, and you lose some. Anyone who held Radius Residential Care Limited (NZSE:RAD) over the last year knows what a loser feels like.

Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns.
