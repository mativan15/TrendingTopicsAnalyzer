SAN FRANCISCO — 
Four allied countries are working on a new high-tech method of cracking down on illegal fishing, one of the Asia-Pacific region's biggest issues at sea. The initiative would hold violators accountable and draw countries together for the cause.
The satellite-based surveillance proposed by leaders of the Quad countries — Australia, India, Japan and the United States — would focus on China, the region's biggest fishing nation, and Beijing is already upset.
On May 24, the Quad — formally the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue — launched its Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness to monitor unregulated fishing in the territorial waters of multiple coastal states.
