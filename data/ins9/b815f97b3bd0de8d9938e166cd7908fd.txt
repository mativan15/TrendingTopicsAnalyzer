The cousin of a Comancheros boss who has evaded police for a number of years has been arrested in Thailand on drugs charges. Shane Elwood Ngakuru has been named as a co-defendant of a number of people facing charges in New Zealand. Detective Inspector Paul Newman confirmed Ngakuru, who is also a Comancheros member, had been arrested in Thailand following a joint operation involving the FBI and Thai Police. 'He was arrested by Thai CIB in Samutprakan province early this morning,' Newman said on Wednesday.
