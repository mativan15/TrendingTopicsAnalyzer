M&S has launched a deal this week where you can get a premium beauty haul at a bargain price.
Starting from today, customers can buy the Summer Beauty Bag for just £25 – with the products inside worth over £160.
You'll need to spend £30 or more on M&S clothing, home, or beauty to be eligible for the offer, but it's still a massive saving on a makeup and skincare refresh.
Simply add the Summer Beauty Bag to your basket along with your other purchases. Once the £30 limit has been met, your total will be automatically changed.
