The high, industrywide aluminum prices that have driven Pittsburgh-based Alcoa Corp.'s income over the past several quarters have fallen.

And as such, the manufacturing company reported a net loss for the quarter, also citing inflated energy and raw material costs.

Alcoa's (NYSE: AA) adjusted net loss for the quarter, which excludes a $652 million charge due to a $1 billion pension annuity transaction, was $60 million. The total net loss was $746 million, or $4.17 per share. Revenue for the quarter was $2.
