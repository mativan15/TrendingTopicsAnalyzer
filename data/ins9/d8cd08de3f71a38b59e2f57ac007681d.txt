Murder hornets may have been eradicated from the United States as Washington recorded no sightings so far this year.Called Northern giant hornets, or Asian giant hornets, the insects are the largest species of hornet in the world. They are native to Asia, and an invasive species in the U.S. that poses a great risk to the native ecosystem. Scientists are not sure how the species entered the country, though some suspect they may have come from an illegal importation.The species were first detected in Blaine, Washington in December 2019, according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture, (WSDA), as well as in British Columbia.
