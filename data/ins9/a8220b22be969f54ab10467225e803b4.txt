As if there wasn't already enough drama going down in the U.K., the juicy new trailer for The Crown was released on Thursday morning.

The teaser for the Netflix drama seems to be aiming straight for the hearts of millennials, showcasing footage of Princess Diana's most famous moments—including her legendary black dress and controversial BBC interview with Martin Bashir—all set to The Verve's ever-dramatic 'Bittersweet Symphony.'

Following Queen Elizabeth II's death, The Crown and its dramatization of the intrigue behind palace doors has attracted a brighter, perhaps harsher spotlight.
