After hyping up the future of cloud gaming for so long, Microsoft is now saying it's not such a big deal – just so it can buy Activision.
While regulators in Brazil and Saudi Arabia have approved Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the company is facing significant pushback from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).
The CMA is currently conducting a second investigation into the deal, as it has concerns that it could actively harm Microsoft's competitors, such as Sony. So, Microsoft is doing everything it can to convince the CMA otherwise.
