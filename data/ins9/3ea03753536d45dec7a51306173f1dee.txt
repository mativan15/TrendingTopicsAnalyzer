Amazon's (AMZN 1.23%) stock split is set to happen. The company's shareholders recently approved a 20-for-1 stock split, and Amazon shares will begin trading at the split-adjusted price on June 6.
But one important date already has passed. I'm talking about the record date. That's the day on which shareholders must own Amazon stock in order to collect the additional shares once the split is complete. In the case of Amazon, this date was May 27.
So what happens if you buy the stock right now? Do you miss out on those extra shares?
