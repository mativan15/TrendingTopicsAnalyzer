Boston Celtics camp invitee Jake Layman may soon be headed to play overseas in Greece according to new reporting from SDNA's Tolis Kotzias (via BasketNews). Per Kotzias, the Maryland alum may end up playing for Panathinaikos Athens if 'nothing changes in the near future,' presumably with regard to an offer by another NBA team to join them for this season.
The potential move to Athens seems to be awaiting only hearing back for certain from whatever NBA ball clubs Layman's agent may be in conversation with, as 'Panathinaikos have already agreed on the financial terms with the player, with Layman also agreeing to move to Europe' according to reports.
