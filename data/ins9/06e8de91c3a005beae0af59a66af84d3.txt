News of first-half trading at 888 Holdings was overshadowed by its gross debt of £1.8 billion yesterday as rising interest rates increased pressure on the gambling operator.The cash cost of servicing the debt, taken on to fund the acquisition of the non-United States operations of William Hill that was completed on July 1, has risen from between £130 million and £140 million to about £170 million next year, prompting analysts to downgrade their forecasts.Ivor Jones, at Peel Hunt, the broker, cut his target price from 500p to 210p a share, which even at the lower figure is more than double the present price.
