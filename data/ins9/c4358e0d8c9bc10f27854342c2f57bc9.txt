Spencer Platt/Getty Images News The high prevalence of gun violence creates the need for various solutions to help deter and reduce these horrific incidents. ShotSpotter (NASDAQ:SSTI) is a company that offers precision security solutions for law enforcement and security personnel in the United States, Bahamas, and South Africa to help identify, locate, and deter these incidents. The company's expansion into new cities and adding services to existing customers will help grow future revenue. My thesis is that ShotSpotter's strong revenue growth rate is likely to continue as gun violence remains high in many regions in the United States and beyond.
