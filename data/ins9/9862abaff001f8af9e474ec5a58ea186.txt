Accepted a job offer earlier this week, but will likely receive better offer. What do I do?

I'm a recent college grad who just accepted my first job offer and am supposed start June 13th. Was really excited, although the hours are not ideal as I'm currently studying for the LSAT. it's a job with my state's DFL as a field organizer and it's a 55 hour work week (some nights and weekends) with not the greatest pay, but not bad. Also is temporary and ends in Nov. with the election timeline. I was originally hoping for somewhere to work during my full gap year up until I start law school so I could save up some money.
