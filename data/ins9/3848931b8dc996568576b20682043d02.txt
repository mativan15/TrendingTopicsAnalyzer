Football is a numbers game and Erling Haaland is winning it. Since Manchester City signed their star striker in the summer he has already bagged the record for the fewest games to reach 15 Premier League goals (nine), the youngest player to net 25 goals in the Champions League (22 years, 47 days) and become the first man to score hat-tricks in three consecutive Premier League home games.Another noteworthy number is 6,000. No, not the amount of goals the Norwegian is forecast to score before he retires, but how many calories he consumes each day.
