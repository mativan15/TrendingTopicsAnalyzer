TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday as investor sentiment soured, but the currency's decline was capped as hot domestic inflation data led to raised bets on another jumbo interest rate hike by the Bank of Canada.

Canada's annual inflation rate inched down to 6.9% in September, Statistics Canada data showed.

That was the third consecutive monthly deceleration but a notch ahead of analyst forecasts of 6.
