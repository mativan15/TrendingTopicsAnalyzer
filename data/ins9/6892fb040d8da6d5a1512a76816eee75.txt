On a sweaty evening last July, Rent the Runway CEO Jennifer Hyman was having a glass of rosé on the steel patio overlooking the small backyard behind her brownstone in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. Her three-year-old daughter, Selene ('Seeley'), sat on her lap, while Aurora, five, played with the straps of her mother's sleeveless patterned shirt. (The top, from the brand Warm, is available to rent—or buy for $337.50—on Rent the Runway). Through the glass doors that led to a white, airy, open kitchen, her husband, Ben Stauffer–a laid-back video editor turned stay-at-home dad during the pandemic–asked her casually if she'd like him to set aside for her some of the meatballs he was cooking for the kids.
