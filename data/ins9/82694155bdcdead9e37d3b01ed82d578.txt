By Megumi Fujikawa Japan's finance minister on Friday reiterated concerns about the yen's rapid falls and his readiness to intervene in the foreign-exchange market. "There is no change at all in our stance that we will take appropriate action, if there are any excessive moves" in the currency market, Shunichi Suzuki said at a news conference. The comment came after the yen fell below the 150 threshold against the dollar on Thursday for the first time since August 1990. The pair last stood around 150.
