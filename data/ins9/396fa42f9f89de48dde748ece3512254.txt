SOUTHERN PINES — On a day when the setup at the Pine Needles Lodge and Golf Club was supposed to be tougher, Lydia Ko delivered a near-flawless round to roar back into contention at the 77th US Women's Open Championship on Saturday.

The 25-year-old from New Zealand shot a disappointing 1-over-par 72 in Thursday's opening round, then rebounded with a 2-under 69 on Friday.

After watching competitors produce 42 rounds in the 60s the first two days, the United States Golf Association toughened the 6,638-yard layout for the third round.
