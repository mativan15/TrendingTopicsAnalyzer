franckreporter AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) has agreed to pay $23 million in fines for its part in a bribery scheme in Illinois. A company executive there is accused of funneling more than $22,000 in bribes to the Illinois assembly's Speaker of the House in return for a favorable bill that would eliminate a requirement that the telecommunications company provide landline service to every home in the state. Landlines can be costly to maintain, and homeowners are increasingly less likely to initiate and pay for the service.
