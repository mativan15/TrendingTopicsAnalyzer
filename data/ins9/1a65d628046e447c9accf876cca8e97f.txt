More than a year after Bitcoin became legal tender in El Salvador, a new poll Tuesday showed most people in the country consider the controversial move by President Nayib Bukele as a "failure."

According to the poll by the University of Central America (UCA), 75.6 percent of respondents said they never used cryptocurrency in 2022, and 77 percent consider its adoption 14 months ago as legal tender, alongside the dollar, "to have been a failure."

Bitcoin, whose value has tumbled over the past year, "is the government's most unpopular measure, the most criticized and the most frowned upon," said UCA rector Andreu Oliva, commenting on the results of the study.
