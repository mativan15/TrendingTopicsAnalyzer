The Cleveland Browns offseason has been an interesting one primarily surrounding the acquisition of QB Deshaun Watson. If they hadn't acquired him, after trying, the discussion around their belief in QB Baker Mayfield and his ability to return to health would dominate the headlines.
Instead, Mayfield's future remains in doubt.
The Watson acquisition, with the uncertainty around league discipline, makes it hard to really assess the team's offseason. Outside of Watson, the trades for WR Amari Cooper and DE Chase Winovich, along with retaining DE Jadeveon Clowney, TE David Njoku and DB Ronnie Harrison stand out as their biggest moves.
