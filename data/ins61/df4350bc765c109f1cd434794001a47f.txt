THE National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Mandaue received additional complaints a week after they raided an alleged networking company in Lapu-Lapu City.



Lawyer Renan Oliva, head of NBI-Central Visayas, said more than 10 persons came to their office to file complaints against JStore Innovation Worldwide a week after they raided the store last Wednesday, May 25, 2022, in Barangay Pajo, Lapu-Lapu City.



The raid was based on the complaints from clients that the company defrauded them of their investments under the pretext of a multi-level marketing scheme.
