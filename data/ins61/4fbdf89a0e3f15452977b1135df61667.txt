"Song of the summer" is a well-known designation that gets tagged to some earworm pop song every June or July. While no tune has grabbed the title just yet, Old Bay Goldfish are making a strong case to be the snack of the summer. Your favorite childhood cracker snack teamed up with Old Bay, the iconic summer seafood seasoning to launch limited-edition Old Bay Goldfish. The kicked-up crackers, which launched in May, sold out in hours and were impossible to find for weeks. According to a spokesperson for Pepperidge Farm (makers of Goldfish), there's no set date for when more of these tasty bite-size munchies will hit shelves, but I've seen some limited stock start to pop up.
