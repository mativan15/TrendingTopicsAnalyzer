Tyler Wright has been saving and investing the majority of his income since he landed his first full-time job. While he started his career with a small base salary — $30,000 a year for his commission-based role as a recruiter at a healthcare staffing company — he barely had any expenses during his first two years out of college.He drove a car that was paid off and he didn't have to pay for housing.
