It's still very early in the Oilers season, but after two games the Edmonton goaltender with the best stats has not been the $25 million free agent. Jack Campbell was brought in to be the starter at $5 million a year, while rookie Stuart Skinner is making $750,000 as he tries to establish himself as a quality NHL backup. Campbell was pulled in favour of Skinner Saturday night in a 4-3 loss to the Calgary Flames. He also stopped 33 of 36 shots in a season-opening win against the Vancouver Canucks.
