The owner of Britain's third largest energy supplier has gatecrashed Octopus Energy's bid for Bulb, a failed rival.Ovo has renewed its interest in buying Bulb in a move that would create a combined group with 5.5 million customers.Stephen Fitzpatrick, 45, founder and chief executive of Ovo, has written to advisers handling the sale of Bulb to say he would like to reopen discussions about the future of the company.Bulb collapsed into special administration in November last year after a big rise in energy prices caused a string of failures in the industry.
