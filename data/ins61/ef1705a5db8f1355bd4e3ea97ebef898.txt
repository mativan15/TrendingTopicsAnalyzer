Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster said Monday that leaked documents from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) showing slower-than-projected growth of its key metaverse platform represent a "very clear disappointment." In an interview with CNBC, the Loup Ventures founder and managing partner also suggested that the lack of dramatic consumer demand for the metaverse concept put the timeline for the overall technology in doubt. "[The news] begs the question, which is how long is the metaverse really away here? How far are we away from this actually taking off?" he asked.
