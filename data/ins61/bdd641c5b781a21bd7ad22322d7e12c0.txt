Insulin prices have risen sharply over the last two decades, forcing more than a million diabetics in the US to take less than they need to maintain good health, according to a study published this week in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

Based on data from the 2021 National Health Interview Survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers estimate that 1.3 million Americans with diabetes – roughly 16.5% of all diabetics in the country – rationed their use of insulin last year in order to save money.
