When it comes to anti-aging products, and skincare in general, it's easy to focus on the face and forget everything else. Really, you're doing yourself a disservice since your hands and neck can be the first areas to show signs of aging. For your hands, consider a customer-loved moisturizer, and for your neck, get acquainted with Dermelect's Self-Esteem Professional Neck Firming Lift.

Self-Esteem is a 2-ounce cream that targets sagging, wrinkled neck skin using antioxidant squalene, lipid-rich avocado oil, anti-inflammatory green tea extract, and chemical exfoliants including alpha hydroxy acids, beta hydroxy acids, and glycolic acid.
