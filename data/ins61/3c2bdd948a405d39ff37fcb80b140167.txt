Chris Philp, a culture minister, said that councils should 'show a little bit of flexibility' and grant permission 'even if they are maybe technically after the deadline'.
Yet, street party applications have been turned down by local authorities for a number of other reasons, including for being on bus routes and for failing to meet deadlines for road closures.
Sefton Council, another Labour-run authority in the North West, turned down one application submitted by a business for a street party partly because it felt it was 'made as a commercial opportunity' rather than as a community celebration to commemorate the Queen's 70 years on the throne.
