London CNN —

For those watching from outside the UK, it might seem bizarre that Boris Johnson is being tipped to return as prime minister, just months after he was forced to resign in disgrace following a string of scandals.

That, however, is the main talking point in Westminster following Liz Truss's announcement that she would resign after just 45 days in office.

Allies of Johnson believe that he is the only person who can unite the governing Conservative party and prevent an electoral wipeout that could put the party in opposition for a generation.
