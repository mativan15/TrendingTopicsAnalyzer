(Bloomberg) -- Crypto fugitive Do Kwon, who faces charges in South Korea related to his collapsed stablecoin ecosystem, said he's cooperating with prosecutors but hasn't seen the arrest warrant issued for him. 'We haven't seen a copy of the arrest warrant so every piece of data we are consuming is from the media,' the co-founder of Terraform Labs said in an interview on the Unchained podcast published Tuesday and hosted by journalist Laura Shin. He added that he's cooperated with all document requests he's received from authorities.
