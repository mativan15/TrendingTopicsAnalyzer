Harry Kane maintained his incredible strike rate against Everton with a penalty in his 400th Tottenham Hotspur appearance paving the way for a 2-0 Premier league win over Everton on Saturday.Spurs were struggling to break down a resolute Everton team who had the better chances in the first half, but the prolific Kane once again made the difference.After being taken down by Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford just before the hour mark, Kane dispatched his spot kick beyond the dive of his England team mate to take his league tally against the Merseyside club to 14 in 15 games.
