Published: 19:16 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 19:18 EDT, 21 October 2022 Companies failing to protect sensitive data will face huge fines under laws to be introduced by the Albanese government.The legislation massively increases the current penalty for serious or repeated breaches from $2.22 million to whichever is the greater of $50 million, 30 per cent of the company's turnover in the relevant period, or three times the value of any benefit gained from the stolen data.The bill, to be introduced to parliament next week, comes during the fallout of the massive Optus data hack and a cyber attack on private health insurance provider Medibank.
