Washington: President Joe Biden called Wednesday on US energy companies to increase oil production and to lower retail gasoline prices as he announced a new release from strategic US reserves in a bid to dampen fuel prices."Families are hurting," Biden said in remarks from the White House.High fuel prices are threatening the US economy and also feeding voter anger at the administration three weeks before midterm elections to decide control of Congress.Biden has struggled to find solutions to a problem rooted in Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the recent decision by the Saudi-led OPEC+ cartel to cut its own oil production.
