It almost sounds too good to be true: Take basalt dust that today is wasted in the manufacturing of things like asphalt shingles, sprinkle it on farmers' fields, and it raises crop yields while also removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Where's the catch?
For the entire thing to work, farmers need to add just the right amount of basalt. Too little and they don't capture much carbon and their crops don't see any benefits. Too much and the field could end up releasing carbon instead of removing it.
