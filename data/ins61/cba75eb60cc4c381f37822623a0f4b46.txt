By Joe Hoppe MobilityOne Ltd. said Wednesday that it expects to report a small slip in profit after taxes and a slight rise in revenue for 2021. The U.K.-listed, Malaysia-focused provider of payment services said it expects profit after taxes of 1.5 million pounds ($1.9 million) compared with GBP1.6 million for 2020, slipping due to higher administration expenses. Revenue for the year is expected at GBP255.7 million compared with GBP246.7 million the year before, on the back of continued growth in its e-payment business in Malaysia.
