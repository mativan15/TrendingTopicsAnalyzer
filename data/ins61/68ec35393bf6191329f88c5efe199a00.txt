Internet sensation Libs of TikTok, known for sharing videos of left-wing individuals making eyebrow-raising comments, was suspended from Instagram early Friday but suddenly regained access after conservatives criticized the social media juggernaut. The Libs of TikTok account holder tweeted a message from Instagram declaring the account was suspended and there was a 30-day window to "disagree with the decision." Instagram stated Libs of TikTok's account violated the social media platform's Community Guidelines but didn't elaborate on how the rules were broken.
