SANTA CLARA -- The 49ers already have won the week.

Now, they have an actual football game.

The 49ers play Sunday at Levi's Stadium against Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs.

This certainly is a marquee game in the NFL, and the 49ers added another headliner to their roster with a trade to acquire running back Christian McCaffrey from the Carolina Panthers.
