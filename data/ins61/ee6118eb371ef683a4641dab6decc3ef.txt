In celebration of the undisputed ‘Queen of Rock ‘n Roll,' Barbie has unveiled a doll in Tina Turner's likeness commemorating her chart-topping hit.



It's been nearly 40 years since Tina Turner strutted solo into a new phase of her already storied career, topping the charts with her 1984 hit, 'What's Love Got to Do with It.' In the video for the sultry single, Turner memorably struts down tough city streets in a jean jacket atop a black leather minidress and heels, her legendary legs accentuated by fishnet stockings and her bronzed hair in a spiky, rock goddess-worthy ‘do.
