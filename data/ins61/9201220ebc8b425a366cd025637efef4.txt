Four of the top eight national seeds had easy wins on their home fields in NCAA baseball regional openers Friday. Vanderbilt, which reached the last two College World Series finals, continued its late-season swoon and will have to fight its way out of the loser's bracket to advance. Jordan Beck hit two of No. 1 Tennessee's five homers and Blake Tidwell allowed three hits and struck out seven in 7 2/3 innings of a 10-0 victory over Alabama State. The Volunteers will play Saturday against Campbell in what could be a slugfest between teams that lean on the long ball.
