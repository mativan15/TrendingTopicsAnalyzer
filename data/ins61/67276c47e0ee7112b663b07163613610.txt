Lando Norris is no stranger to gaming. When he's not racing in Formula 1 with McLaren, the 22-year-old racing prodigy is streaming video games on his Twitch channel to thousands of viewers, often playing alongside fellow drivers Charles Leclerc and George Russell. In late 2020, Norris founded Quadrant, an esports organization that combines the driver's 'love for Gaming, Lifestyle, Content, and Apparel.' Previously, the org only fielded professional teams in Halo and Call of Duty, but as of this week, Quadrant has entered the Rocket League Championship Series.
