Considering that unlike cases under the Code of Civil Procedure, there is no provision under the CrPC or the Negotiable Instruments Act to try cases ex parte, the Karnataka High Court has suggested amendments to the latter. "The legislature must think of bringing suitable amendments to Code of Criminal Procedure or to the special law to enable the court to conduct the proceedings in the absence of the accused. The amendment, perhaps, may deter unscrupulous elements who would resort to avoiding service of summons or execution of warrant against them," the HC said in a recent judgement.
