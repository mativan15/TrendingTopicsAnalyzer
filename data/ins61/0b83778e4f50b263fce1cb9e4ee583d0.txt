A 47-year-old Harlingen man has been sentenced to more than six years in federal prison on a charge of child exploitation.

Authorities said Rico Giovani Machietto would have children in the Philippines send nude pictures of them to him and he would compensate their families by sending them money.

Machietto appeared Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Rolando Olvera Jr., who sentenced him to 80 months in prison. He pleaded guilty to one count of child exploitation Oct.
