OAKLAND, Calif. — Franchy Cordero hit a three-run homer off Frankie Montas in the sixth inning and the Boston Red Sox completed a three-game sweep of the Oakland Athletics with a 5-2 victory Sunday. Rich Hill pitched three-hit ball over six innings and had five strikeouts. Rafael Devers homered and drove in two runs as the Red Sox extended their winning streak to four and got back to .500 (27-27) for the first time since April 22. The A's lost their seventh straight and fell to 7-23 at home — the worst record in the majors and the second-worst in franchise history through 30 games.
