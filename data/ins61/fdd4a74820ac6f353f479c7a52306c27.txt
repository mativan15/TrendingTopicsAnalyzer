Matt Burns, The Boy Hotspur, externalIn 60 Premier League contests with Manchester United, there have only been 10 Spurs wins in total. As for Old Trafford, it has not been a happy hunting ground for us with only four wins in 30 years.It's third against fifth, though, as we head into a World Cup-induced scrum of games and Tottenham are unusually in the superior position.These are uncharacteristic times for both sides. Antonio Conte is steering Spurs towards success in a particularly workmanlike fashion, while Erik ten Hag finds himself battling with a Manchester United side which has been, and still occasionally is, remarkably dysfunctional.
