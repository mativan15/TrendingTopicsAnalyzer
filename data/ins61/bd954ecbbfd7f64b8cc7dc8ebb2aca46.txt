Three Washington County Board of Education members face three challengers for their seats in the nonpartisan race this November.

With only six candidates for three seats, the contest did not appear on the primary ballot in July.

Elections for the seven members of the school board are staggered every two years. Members serve four-year terms. The elections are nonpartisan, meaning no party affiliation is attached to the candidate on the ballot.

The board approves budgets, policies and personnel moves for the countywide school system, which has an estimated 22,000 students and 3,500 employees.
