Jun. 4—HIGH POINT — Todd Eckstein fondly recalled seeing High Point University for the first time while he was considering colleges as a high school golfer about a dozen years ago.

Eckstein eventually chose Davidson and after playing for the Wildcats, served as an assistant coach at four schools, including three seasons at Furman and the last two at Virginia Tech, where he was also the recruiting coordinator.

He was back at HPU on Friday and introduced as the Panthers fifth head men's golf coach by athletics director Dan Hauser during a press conference in the Steele Center.
