There's a new jumble of Covid variants on the loose: BQ.1, BQ.1.1, and XBB. It's enough to make the heads of a pandemic-weary public spin.

Here's what we know about them: The BQs are offshoots of the reigning BA.5 Omicron strain, which once made up nearly all Covid cases in the U.S. and is still responsible for nearly seven out of 10.

But infections with the new BQ variants have tripled in the past two weeks, according to CDC data.

'On paper, [BQ.1.1] looks like a virus that has probably, to date, the most ability to escape vaccine-induced immunity, as well as some antibody treatments,' said Andy Pekosz, a professor of microbiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in a Global News video.
