Mark your calendars, people. Made In Cookware is re-releasing four of its bestselling limited-edition knives on Thursday, October 20. They originally sold out in just a few hours when they first dropped, so you'll need to have your finger ready to hit 'add to cart' as soon as the re-release goes live.

Made In is re-releasing the 8-inch Chef Knife with the blue carapace handle, which first launched in 2019 and sold out in four hours, the green micarta-handled Boning Knife, perfect for removing the fat from cuts of meat ('and not a gram more'), the heavy-duty ebony wood-handled Cleaver, and the 6-inch Chef Knife with the black micarta handle that sold out in less than 24 hours the last time it dropped.
