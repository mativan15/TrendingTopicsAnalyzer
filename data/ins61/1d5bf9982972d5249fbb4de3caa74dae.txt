Oklahoma City Thunder rookie Jalen Williams will be sidelined for at least 7-10 days after undergoing surgery on Friday to address a right orbital bone fracture, the team announced.
Williams suffered the injury on Wednesday in the season opener versus the Minnesota Timberwolves after taking an elbow to the face from Jaden McDaniels. The play happened at the 4:29 mark of the second quarter when McDaniels made the contact on a drive to the rim.
The 12th pick hit the court in pain and stayed down for a few minutes to regroup.
