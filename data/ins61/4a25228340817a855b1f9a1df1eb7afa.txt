When the last episode of Chopper's Politics was published, we had a different Chancellor. By the time the next one comes out, we may well have another Prime Minister, the way this week is going.
The Telegraph's Political Editor Ben Riley-Smith and Tony Diver, Whitehall Correspondent, join Christopher Hope to talk about burning the mini-Budget, if the Tories' time is up, and if it might not be such a bizarre idea to bring back Boris Johnson.
Plus former Telegraph writer George Trefgarne on why he thinks MPs, not Conservative party members, should have a say in who takes over from Truss, if the time comes.
