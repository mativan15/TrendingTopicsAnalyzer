The government has reversed a controversial decision by the previous government to recognise West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.It comes less than 24 hours after the government said there had been "no change" to the previous policy because the issue had not yet been considered by cabinet.Foreign Minister Penny Wong, speaking after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, said Australia remained a steadfast friend of Israel, and an unwavering supporter of the Palestinian people."Today, the government has reaffirmed Australia's previous and long-standing position that Jerusalem is a final status issue, a final status issue that should be resolved as part of any peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian people," she said.
