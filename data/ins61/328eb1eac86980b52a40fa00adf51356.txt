SANTA CLARA — Christian McCaffrey professed his endearing love for the Carolina region Friday morning as he headed back to the West Coast to resume his football career with the 49ers.
McCaffrey, a 2017 first-round draft pick out of Stanford by the Panthers, was traded Thursday night in exchange for three draft picks next year (second, third and fourth rounds) and a 2024 fifth-round selection.
'I'm forever grateful for all of the people who have helped make these past 5 1/2 years so special for me,' McCaffrey tweeted at 7:46 a.
