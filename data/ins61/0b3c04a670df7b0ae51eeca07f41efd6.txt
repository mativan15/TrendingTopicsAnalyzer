Jacob Rees-Mogg has insisted communities will have a 'veto' on fracking in their area, as he sought to limit a Tory rebellion over shale gas extraction.The Business Secretary said national government would be unable to overrule the objections from communities, with one option under consideration involving local referendums for areas where fracking is proposed.Mr Rees-Mogg, in a message directed at Conservative MPs, told the Commons: 'There's an absolute local consent lock.'Any process to determine local consent must be run independently and this House will vote on any scheme that we bring forward.
