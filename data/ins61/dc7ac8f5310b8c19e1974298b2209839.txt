Despite seven consecutive 8%-plus annual headline inflation readings, financial markets are being complacent about the growing risk that the U.S. may be entering a prolonged 1970's-style era of slower growth and inflation, which could require even larger rate increases than already seen. That is the view of research analyst Henry Allen at Deutsche Bank DB, +1.79%, the Frankfurt-based bank which saw a risk in June that inflation would fail to decelerate. As evidence that markets are still underestimating inflation, Allen cites the way stock and bonds have returned to a relative sense of calm to kick off the week, following a week of 'breathtaking volatility' and despite the upside surprises to U.
