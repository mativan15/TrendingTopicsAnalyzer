NEW DELHI: Widely-tracked market maven and chairman of Group Raamdeo Agrawal finds a silver lining in the record-breaking selloff of Indian equities by foreign institutional investors (FIIs). "It's good that the FIIs are selling. You are now getting something which costs Rs 10 at Rs 7-8. Otherwise, it would be very expensive," said the 66-year-old fund manager in an interaction with ET NOW. As aggressive rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and other European central banks have sparked recession fears, thus buoying the US dollar, global investors are selling emerging market equities and parking money in the safe-haven US dollar.
