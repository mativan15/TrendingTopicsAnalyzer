Vodafone Group and Altice joined forces to provide fiber-to-the-home to up to seven million homes in Germany, the companies announced this week.
The new connections will be deployed over a six-year period in a €7 billion ($6.8 billion) project. It is an expansion of Vodafone's large existing 1Gbps broadband presence in Germany. The companies expect joint venture FibreCo to be up and running by the first half of 2023.
'This significant infrastructure investment supports the country's social, economic and digital development and the broadband ambitions of the German government as part of Europe's Digital Decade targets,' said Vodafone's Nick Read, group chief executive, in a press release.
