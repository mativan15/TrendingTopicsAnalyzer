Jorge Villalba Shares of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (NYSE:ZIM) are suffering from collapsing container shipping rates… and it may get a whole lot worse before it gets better. ZIM's share price has fallen from $90 in March to about $24 yesterday due to a repricing of earnings prospects in the shipping industry and I believe shares could revalue lower in the event that a major recession grips the global economy. ZIM Integrated Shipping's TTM dividend yield exceeds 100%, according to Seeking Alpha, while the forward dividend yield is 78%.
