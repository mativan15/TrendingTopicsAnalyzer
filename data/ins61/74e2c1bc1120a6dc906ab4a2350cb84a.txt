Chris Cuomo grilled Kanye West over his series of antisemitic remarks in a contentious interview, during which he appeared to question the rapper's mental state.

The former CNN anchor conducted an interview with West on NewsNation after the rapper, who is legally known as Ye, tweeted that he would go "death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE." West made further antisemetic comments in the interview, ranting about what he characterized as the "Jewish underground media mafia" and complaining about times that "bad business has been done with me," also telling Cuomo he doesn't "believe" in the term antisemetic.
