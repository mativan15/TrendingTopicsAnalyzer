Background
The 1938 World Cup was held under the shadow of the Spanish civil war, the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, the rebellious actions of Benito Mussolini's Italy and the ongoing boycott of Uruguay.
When France was chosen to host the World Cup two years before the tournament, South American giants Uruguay and Argentina announced a boycott.
