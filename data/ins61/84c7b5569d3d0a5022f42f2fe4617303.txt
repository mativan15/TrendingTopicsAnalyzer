Former vice-chancellors (V-C) of the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) on Tuesday came forward to express shock and dismay over the purported communique wherein state governor Banwarilal Purohit on Tuesday asked chief minister Bhagwant Mann to remove the present V-C Satbir Singh Gosal after terming his appointment 'totally illegal'.While the former heads of the premier agri university discussed the technical aspect and the autonomous status of the argi university, they also dubbed the entire fiasco as 'unfortunate'.
