(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong officials canceled the screening of a Batman film one year after passage of a law that lets them ban movies on national security grounds.

The showing of the 2008 movie The Dark Knight set for Oct. 27 at an outdoor venue was called off 'based on direction from the HK Government Office for Film, Newspaper and Article Administration,' according to a notice that organizers sent to ticket holders on Thursday.

The notice didn't give a reason for the move, saying only that the movie Iron Man would be shown instead and refunds were available.
