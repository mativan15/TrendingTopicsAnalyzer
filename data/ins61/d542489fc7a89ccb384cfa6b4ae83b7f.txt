Five candidates are vying for three open seats on the Los Gatos-Saratoga Union High School District board in the Nov. 8 election, and board president Katherine Tseng said the newly elected board will be making important decisions in the coming years.
'It's going to be very important for our board composition,' Tseng said of the election. 'I'm hoping that our community makes a good decision, gets to know the candidate profiles to see which candidates can really help us to move forward,' .
Along with Tseng, board member Theresa Bond's term expires in 2024.
