On Friday morning two young women approached Vincent van Gogh's 'Sunflowers,' on display in the National Gallery in London, and hurled tomato soup across the blooms, before gluing themselves to the gallery wall.

The two activists were part of a climate-protest outfit with an illuminating name: Just Stop Oil. Celebrating their vandalism, the group declared that the 'disruption is in response to the government's inaction on both the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis,' and that it was deliberately timed to protest both the 'launch of a new round of oil and gas licensing' and 'an energy price hike' that threatens to throw 'almost 8 million households' into 'fuel poverty.
