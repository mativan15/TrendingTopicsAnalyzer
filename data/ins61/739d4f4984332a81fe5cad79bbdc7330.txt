Here's how the process works, according to SuperGround chair and cofounder Tuomas Koskinen. A mixture of vegetable protein and chicken bones with some meat attached is heat-shocked and then passed through an extruder to create a bone-vegetable-meat blend that can be mixed with ground chicken meat. 'The bone becomes virtually indistinguishable from other components under a microscope, and using a microscope alone the different components cannot be identified,' says Koskinen. The end result is nuggets and other ground chicken products that can incorporate between 5 and 30 percent of the bone-containing mass.
