Anna May Wong, who was the first Chinese American film star in Hollywood, becomes the first Asian American to be featured on US currency. Her face is to appear on 25-cent coins starting October 24. Wong, who worked in Hollywood during a time of open racism and stereotyping, broke ground in her acting career that ranged from silent cinema through the talkies, to the golden age of Hollywood. Her first lead role was in the 1922 film "The Toll of the Sea," and she later appeared alongside Douglas Fairbanks in "The Thief of Bagdad" (1924) and Marlene Dietrich in "Shanghai Express" (1932).
