Punjab's boxer Simranjit Kaur Baatth won gold in the women's lightweight finals at the recent National Games.
 

She has often been termed as the best female boxer to come out of Punjab, and why not? After all, Simranjit Kaur Baatth is the only female boxer from the state to have represented the country at the Olympics. And more recently, she won a gold medal at the National Games in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. When asked about her win — during her recent trip to Delhi to get felicitated for her win — she beams with happiness, and says, 'It's a great moment for me as I have been able to enjoy the shine of a gold medal after a long time! Having missed out on it in my recent competitions, only I know what it means.
