Elon Musk's $44 billion Twitter buyout is still expected to close next week, analysts and a source familiar with the deal said, despite a curveball report about a potential national security review that sent Twitter shares tanking on Friday. 
Twitter shares fell as much as 16% in pre-market trading and were down about 4.4% at $50.14 later in the morning following a Bloomberg report that the Biden administration is considering investigating potential national security risks posed by the deal. 
US officials were reportedly concerned about Musk's recent threat to cut off SpaceX's Starlink internet service in Ukraine, which he has since walked back, as well as a report that he discussed the war with Vladimir Putin.
