Each year the Philadelphia Business Journal recognizes the region's most impactful lawyers for our annual Best of the Bar awards program. We are proud to present this year's class, which consists of 36 lawyers across 10 categories.

Lawyers across Greater Philadelphia were nominated by the public and evaluated by an independent panel of judges. This year's judges were:

Mark Bernstein, former Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas judge
JoAnne Epps, former Temple University Beasley School of Law dean
Andrea Utecht, former general counsel at FMC Corp.
