Grateful dad Rostyslav Kurtiak (pictured back, second from left), 49, told how his family owed their lives to the rocker after he found a home for them in a leafy Berkshire town.  Rostyslav's family of seven are now living in a £500,000 ($562,000) three-story townhouse (pictured) and the singer has pledged to pay their rent and bills for at least a year.
