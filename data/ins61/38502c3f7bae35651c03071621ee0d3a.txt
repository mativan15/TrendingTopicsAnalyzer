A grand jury delivered an indictment against Joseph Tuminelli, a former Paterson police officer and city resident, who was charged with domestic violence offenses last year, adding to a barrage of scandals that have plagued the city's police department.

The panel upheld prosecutors' February 2021 charges of domestic aggravated assault and stalking against the 28-year-old Tuminelli, who will also face a harassment charge not included in the indictment.

Following the accusations, Tuminelli was placed on unpaid suspension, temporarily nixing the officer's reported $33,873 salary, according to Mayor Andre Sayegh last year.
