I am aged 62, my partner is 66, and we are both winding back our work hours to two days a week. We have about $600,000 in superannuation and investment properties worth $1 million and $610,000, with mortgages of about $500,000 and $200,000, respectively. Our home is worth $1.5 million, with a mortgage of $300,000. In a few years, we will likely receive an inheritance of $400,000. We are considering selling one or both investment properties. Should we put that money into super, and/or buy another investment property? We have a financial advisor, but he is paid a percentage of our super, and so has an inherent interest in advising us to boost our super, rather than continuing with property.
