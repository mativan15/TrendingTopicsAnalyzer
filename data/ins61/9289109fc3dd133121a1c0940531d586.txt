James Bond actor Daniel Craig is set to receive the same honour bestowed on 007, as he is awarded a CMG at Windsor Castle for services to film and theatre.
Craig will be made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George – the same honour held by Ian Fleming's iconic character – from the Princess Royal on Tuesday morning.
A CMG is the honour often given to diplomats, and the fictional spy is described as holding it in both the films and the books.
The actor starred in the last five Bond films, first appearing in Casino Royale in 2006 and ending his run with No Time To Die in 2021.
