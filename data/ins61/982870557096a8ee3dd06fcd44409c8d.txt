Iga Swiatek has been killing time between matches at the French Open by reading Agatha Christie's ‘Murder On The Orient Express'.

Next the world number one might want to try ‘And Then There Were None' after she suddenly found herself as the only one of the top 10 seeds still in the tournament.

In fact, ‘The Case Of The Disappearing Seeds' might be one for Hercule Poirot to investigate after Paula Badosa and Aryna Sabalenka crashed out on Saturday, joining seven others on the Roland Garros missing list.
