OPINION: I've spent a career chastising activists who twist statistics, put out junk science and cherry-pick economic data. In their world, the end justifies the means — intellectual honesty, integrity and context be damned. A prime example is the Humane Society of the United States. While the group benefits financially from the public believing donations will directly help cats and dogs, only about 1% of the money raised goes to fund pet shelters. Unfortunately, the problem of deceived donors goes beyond the petty theft found in some animal-centric groups.
