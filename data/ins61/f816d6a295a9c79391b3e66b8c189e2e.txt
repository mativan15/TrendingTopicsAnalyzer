5./15 WEST/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) fell on Thursday after investment firm Piper Sandler downgraded the two social networks, noting that the outlook for digital advertising spending is start to normalize, after a "strong two-year stretch." Analyst Thomas Champion noted that multiples for the sector have decline and are down roughly 40% from their highs, but it's likely that multiples won't start to move higher until "ad spend growth bottoms," if history is any guide, something that is not expected to happen in the near-term.
