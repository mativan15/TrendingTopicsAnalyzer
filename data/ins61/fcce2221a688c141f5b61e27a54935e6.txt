German carmaker BMW said Wednesday it will invest $1.7 billion in the production of electric vehicles in the United States.

The plan includes $1 billion towards expanding the company's Spartanburg US manufacturing plant and $700 million for a new battery assembly facility, BMW said in a statement.

"The BMW group continues the roll-out of its electromobility plan with a new investment in the US," the company said.

The Spartanburg plant in South Carolina is already BMW's biggest factory, producing 1,500 BMW X vehicles a day.
