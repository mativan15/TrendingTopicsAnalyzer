Credit Suisse is seeking to raise more than $1 billion after a year of heavy financial losses, according to a report from Reuters. The embattled bank, the second largest in Switzerland, is looking at several options, Reuters said, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. The firm would rather sell shares to existing major shareholders, but it hasn't ruled out selling an entire business like its asset management division.Credit Suisse plans on completing this deal in the second half of 2022, Reuters reported.
