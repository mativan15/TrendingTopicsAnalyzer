On 23 May 2022, Malaysia announced that they would be imposing curbs on exports of chicken from 1 June 2022. This immediately set off a scramble for fresh chicken in Singapore which relies heavily on Malaysia for imports. Due to the export curbs, prices are expected to increase, especially for fresh chicken.

Singapore imports about 34 per cent of our chicken from Malaysia. Most of these chickens are imported as live chickens and slaughtered and chilled locally. This has a massive impact for many businesses (like Tian Tian Chicken Rice) that rely on fresh chicken.
