Oct. 15—WALTON — Week 9 of the high school football season can be difficult for teams with the motivation factor right ahead of the sectional.

But that was not a problem for the Lewis Cass football team Friday night. The Kings were strong in all three phases of the game in a 28-14 win over a good Rensselaer team at Owens Memorial Field.

The Kings (6-3) earned fifth place in the Hoosier Conference with the win over the Bombers (5-4). They also improved to 4-0 all-time against Rensselaer, which is now in Class 3A.
