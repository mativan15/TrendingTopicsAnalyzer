The son of a former state transportation commissioner who authorities say murdered his wife and then committed suicide in 2014 says his family is 'cautiously optimistic' about the state attorney general's decision to reopen the dormant investigation into his parents' deaths.

Mark Sheridan, the eldest son of John and Joyce Sheridan, has always rejected investigators' claims that his father stabbed his mother, then lit the master bedroom of their Montgomery Township home on fire. But his pleas to renew the inquiry always fell on deaf ears.
