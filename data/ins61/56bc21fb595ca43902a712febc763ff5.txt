The UK prime minister, Liz Truss, announced her resignation from Downing Street on Thursday. She said that she will be stepping down from a Conservative Party leadership election that will take place in the next week. Liz Truss' speech addressed concerns about the economy and businesses. Reiterating that she came to Downing Street in times of economic stability, she said that it was a time when paying bills for families was very difficult. She also reflected on the impact of Russia's war with Ukraine and noted how it shook the whole continent while crippling the economy entirely.
