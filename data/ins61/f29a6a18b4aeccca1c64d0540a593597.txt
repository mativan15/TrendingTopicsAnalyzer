The game of Heardle is inspired from the word puzzle Wordle. In Heardle, the participants listen to a clip from a popular song and try to answer the details about the song, like the artist or the title. With each incorrect and skipped answer, they reveal a few more seconds of the clip. They get six guesses maximum, and the users will hear 16 seconds of the song at most. The idea of the game is to name the song with the least number of guesses possible. Today is October 16 and half of the month has passed.
