The S & P 500 came off its lows for the year after last week's big bounce, and UBS has highlighted several stocks that could be good to own as the market continues to recover. On Tuesday, the broad-market index pulled back slightly. Investors are uncertain of the rally's sustainability as signs of peaking inflation and overblown inflation fears have started to show. In a Tuesday note, UBS said the S & P 500 is oversold by 4 percentage points for the year on fears of a recession induced by the Federal Reserve.
