Boris Johnson has said the Government's emergency cost-of-living support package is a 'big bazooka' which will support families until the surge in energy prices abates.The Prime Minister acknowledged the country still faced a 'bumpy time' due to the soaring costs of oil and gas, but said he was confident it would emerge in a 'much, much stronger position'.Earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak – who on Thursday announced a further £21 billion of support for households – indicated that he could not rule out the need for further measures if global prices remain high.
