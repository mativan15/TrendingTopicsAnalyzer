There's some buoyant, feel-good energy at our disposal if we're willing to slow down enough to tap into it. As our taste for adventure and action-packed experiences begins to wane, we'll be more interested in luxuriating over a sumptuous meal, getting pampered and taking time out to smell the roses. After a rather stressful start to the weekend, the cosmos makes up for it by providing us with the opportunity to mellow out and enjoy some of life's pleasures. Even love and romance get a boost now. We'll be feeling more affectionate and sensual or looking for a commitment.
