The Vedanta Delhi Half Marathon on Sunday will have a strong field of Indian and international runners who will chase success on an altered course from the past. Uganda's Olympic 10,000m bronze medallist Jacob Kiplimo is a last-minute withdrawal while Indian distance ace Avinash Sable returns to a race where he set the national best.Sable clocked 60 minutes, 30 seconds in 2020—first Indian to run under 61 minutes—to finish 10th overall though the event this time comes at the end of a season where he won 3000m steeplechase silver at the Commonwealth Games.
