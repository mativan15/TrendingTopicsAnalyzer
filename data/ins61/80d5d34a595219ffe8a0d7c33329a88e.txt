VAI Global Development, a newly formed entity that's behind the planned $1 billion resort and lagoon entertainment complex in the Phoenix metro, has unveiled new details about the project that's now set to open in late 2023.

The 60-acre Glendale resort will include the soon-to-be largest hotel in Arizona with 1,200 rooms, a 360-degree concert stage, a dozen restaurants and a 6-acre lagoon. The Sheraton Downtown Phoenix is currently the largest hotel in the state with more than 1,000 rooms.

Named after the words vitality and Wai, which is known as fresh water in Hawaiian, the resort aims to become a premier international destination featuring day and nightlife entertainment in a "experiential" hospitality setting.
