NEW ORLEANS (AP) — First-year Saints coach Dennis Allen is seeing his team's resolve tested early this season.

Injuries have piled up at key spots and winnable games have slipped away.

Starting quarterback Jameis Winston has a back injury that hampered him for two games before he gave way to backup Andy Dalton in Week 4. Top receiver Michael Thomas (foot) has missed the past three games. Cornerback Marshon Lattimore (abdomen) went out in Week 5, as did 11th overall draft pick Chris Olave (concussion), who'd been New Orleans' most productive receiver in Thomas' absence.
