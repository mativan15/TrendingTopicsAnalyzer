Breeze Airways said Wednesday that it will start flying from San Francisco International Airport to Cincinnati, starting Feb. 8.

'With no other airline serving Cincinnati nonstop from SFO, this addition will give our guests a faster, more convenient way to the entire northern Kentucky, southern Ohio and southern Indiana area,' said Tom Doxey, president of Breeze Airways.

Breeze is a startup airline that typically offers nonstop service using a region's secondary airport. For example, in the Cleveland area Breeze flies into Akron-Canton Regional Airport.
