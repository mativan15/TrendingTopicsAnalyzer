A lot of Floridians went missing in the 2020 census, which is costing the Sunshine State at least one seat in Congress and untold billions of federal dollars. About 750,600 Floridians were not counted in 2020, according to a new Census Bureau analysis. That's a lot of missing people — more than the combined population of Tampa and St. Petersburg. And more than the population of Wyoming (576,851), Vermont (643,077) or Alaska (733,391).

In being undercounted by the populations of entire states, Florida is failing to get its due — in clout and in federal cash, everything that is based on head counts, from Medicare to highway money.
