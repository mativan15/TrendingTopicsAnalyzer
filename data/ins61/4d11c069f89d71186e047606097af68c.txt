One of New Zealand's smallest airlines is looking to increase its schedule for Palmerston North. Originair has announced that from July 1 it will be providing an increased number of flights between Palmerston North and Nelson, with the aim to provide double daily services or a return trip twice a day on peak days. It will also be implementing a Hamilton flight on Monday mornings aimed squarely at the business community. The flight is due to take off at 8am to get businesspeople into Hamilton city centre just after 9am.
