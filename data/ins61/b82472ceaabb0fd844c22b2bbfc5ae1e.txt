PhonlamaiPhoto Investment Thesis Only very little is being written about ASM (OTCQX:ASMIY) (OTCPK:ASMXF) on Seeking Alpha and this really surprised me. The company is a fast-growing manufacturer of machines used to manufacture semiconductors. The company delivers important machinery for wafer processing. It developed 2 important technologies crucial to keep up with Moore's law. These are Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and Plasma Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition (PEALD). This will be my initial coverage of ASM International in which I will take you through the company and its technologies, and financials, and show you why you should own this company (or not).
