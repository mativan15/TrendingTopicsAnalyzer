Jeff Mursau is facing a rare challenge as he seeks a 10th term in the state Assembly in the Nov. 8 election.

Mursau, R-Crivitz, is running against U.S. Navy veteran and political newcomer Ben Murray, D-Porterfield, to retain the seat to which he was first elected in 2004. It's just the second time Mursau has faced a Democratic Party challenger for the seat in his last five general elections, and he won with 67% of the vote in the one competitive race, in 2018.

The 36th Assembly District is one of the largest in Wisconsin, covering the central part of Oconto; all of Florence, Forest and Menominee counties; about the northern three-quarters of Marinette County; and small parts of eastern Shawano County.
