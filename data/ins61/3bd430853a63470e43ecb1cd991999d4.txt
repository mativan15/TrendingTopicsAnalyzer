We are well into game bird season. I'm not one to go on a huge shoot these days, where the bird count may be 500-plus. I'd rather do a rough shoot with my mates and cook up the birds for supper. 
I'm also not one for hanging birds to the point where the individual flavour of each bird has gone beyond the point of recognition. One of my biggest bugbears is when you see streaky bacon on the breasts of delicately flavoured game birds. Butchers tell me people do it so the birds don't dry out in the oven, but the secret is simply to not overcook them.
