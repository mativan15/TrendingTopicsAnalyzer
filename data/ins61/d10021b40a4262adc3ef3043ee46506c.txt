A Tallahassee man involved in what police say was the area's largest child sex-trafficking ring will spend his life in prison after being convicted this week in federal court.

Tyron C. Watson, 39, was convicted by a jury of two counts of sex trafficking of a minor under 14, according to the U.S. District Attorney for the Northern district of Florida Jason Coody.

Watson, who will have to register as a sex offender, was among at least 170 people arrested in Operation Stolen Innocence.

The operation, announced in November 2020, unfolded after investigators dug into the story of a young girl who was allegedly forced by her own mother and others to have sex for money and drugs.
