Mel B first rose to fame as one-fifth of the popular 1990s girl group, The Spice Girls.

With their infectious dance sound and message of 'Girl Power,' Scary Spice — as Melanie Janine Brown was then known — was part of a new wave of feminism that paired femininity with strength. And the messaging paid off: the Spice Girls became a part of the list of best-selling girl groups of all time, according to reports.

Unfortunately, Mel B didn't always invest her money wisely. Between her lavish lifestyle, bad business investments, and more, the singer and songwriter eventually found herself nearly destitute and struggling to survive.
