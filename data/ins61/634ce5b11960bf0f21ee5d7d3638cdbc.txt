Russian President Vladimir Putin famously miscalculated by sending an unprepared army to fight a four-day war in Ukraine that's now in its fourth month. But Putin got one crucial thing right: the value of oil as a shield to protect Russia's economy and keep his ruthless war going.

The United States, Europe and many other countries have layered withering sanctions on Russia, cutting many of its banks and much of its economy off from the rest of the world. Those are now causing widespread shortages of imported goods and other problems, resulting in hefty inflation and a nationwide decline in living standards for ordinary Russians.
