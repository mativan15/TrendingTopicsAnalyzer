Sega has finally released the first few seconds of gameplay footage from new game Sonic Frontiers, and it looks worryingly good.
Why worryingly? Well, as anyone who's played a Sonic The Hedgehog game in the last two decades will know, they almost always seem promising at first, before gradually seeming less and less so – until the final game is finally revealed to be a dud.
The weight of history might be against it, but hopefully that's not the fate of Sonic Frontiers. The teaser trailer below is very short but it's the first time the game has ever been shown in action, with Sega promising a series of more detailed reveals throughout June.
