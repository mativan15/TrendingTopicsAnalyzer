Billy Edwards Jr. usually stands on the sideline far from the other offensive players. He wants to stay focused on Maryland's game without any distractions. This is how Coach Michael Locksley instructed him to soak in the action early this season. Edwards sees the Terrapins' play call, then watches how the opposing defense reacts. He imagines himself in the role of starting quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa, asking himself what he'd anticipate in that moment and how he would respond.
