Over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids are finally hitting store shelves this week, following approval in August by the Food and Drug Administration. Instead of paying several thousand dollars for a pair of doctor-prescribed hearing aids, consumers now can save money by buying them online and at retail stores.About 37.5 million American adults have some hearing problems, but only about one-fifth of people who would benefit from a hearing aid use one, according to the FDA. High costs, lack of access and social stigma prevent some people from using hearing aids, the FDA said.
