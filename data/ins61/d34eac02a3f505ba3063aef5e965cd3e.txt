Video On Friday NASA released footage of the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter flying further and faster than ever before.
The film recorded during Ingenuity's 25th flight on April 8 when it flew 704 meters at up to 5.5 meters per second.
In the sped-up footage shown below, the vehicle climbs to 10 meters, heads southwest, accelerates to max speed in under three seconds, and flies over Martian sand ripples and rock fields before landing on relatively flat terrain. Youtube Video
 The navigation camera turns off when the rotorcraft is within a meter of landing to keep dust off its navigation system.
