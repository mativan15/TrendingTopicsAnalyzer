Jun. 3—Federal prosecutors are seeking to have Rueben Schwartz detained pending trial after the Conneaut resident was charged with money laundering, citing allegations that Schwartz offered $100,000 to have a Conneaut Police Department detective killed.

On May 26, a magistrate ruled Schwartz could be released on $25,000 secured bond and $25,000 unsecured bond, with conditions, according to court records.

Schwartz was indicted on one count of money laundering, and is accused of selling a pair of properties in exchange for money from drug sales.
