Former Baylor forward Matthew Mayer has reportedly narrowed down his potential transfer options to four programs, according to Jeff Goodman of Stadium.

Mayer, who has one year of eligibility remaining, entered the transfer portal in April while also testing the NBA pre-draft process. He announced this week that he would withdraw from the draft and transfer to a different program next season.

He heard from several programs after entering the portal and unveiled his top four options: Illinois, Memphis, North Carolina and Texas Tech.
