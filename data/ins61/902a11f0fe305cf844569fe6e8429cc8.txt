Olivia Wilde and Florence Pugh are only two of many Hollywood celebrities who have shunned red carpet archetypes to stay completely covered up, and instead are opting to bare more in front of flashing camera lights. On Saturday, Wilde stepped out in a shimmering, see-through Alexandre Vauthier Haute Couture gown for the second annual Academy Museum Gala in Los Angeles, which drew just as much discussion for its impeccable design as it did for the styling choice when Olivia's sheer dress revealed her bare chest.
