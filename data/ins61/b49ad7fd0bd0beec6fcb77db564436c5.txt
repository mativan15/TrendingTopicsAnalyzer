The art and science of stock market investing requires a tolerance for losing money on some of the shares you buy. But it would be foolish to simply accept every extremely large loss as an inevitable part of the game. So we hope that those who held U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:USX) during the last year don't lose the lesson, in addition to the 71% hit to the value of their shares. While some investors are willing to stomach this sort of loss, they are usually professionals who spread their bets thinly.
