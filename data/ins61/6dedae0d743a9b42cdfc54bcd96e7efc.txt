Zambia's decision three years ago to take control of a copper mine in the country's north will be subject to an arbitration hearing in January, the country's mines minister said on Wednesday, after a lengthy dispute over the mine's ownership. Zambia in May 2019 handed control of Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) to a state-appointed provisional liquidator, triggering a legal battle with its previous owner, India-listed , with arguments heard in Zambia and South Africa. Zambia's government accused Vedanta at the time of failing to honour licence conditions, including promised investment - accusations that Vedanta has denied.
