Decontamination potential of date palm fruit via non-thermal plasma technique The potential of the surface dielectric barrier discharge technique (SDBD) was evaluated to decontaminate the date palm fruit. Preliminary investigations emphasized that Aspergillus niger fungus was predominant in most date samples as a post-harvest infestation. The influence of SDBD techniques on the viability of A. niger isolated from date varieties was investigated and documented. Physical and chemical characterizations of treated dates were assessed, and statistical correlation coefficients were calculated and elucidated.
