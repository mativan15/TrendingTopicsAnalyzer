Colombian's peso and stock exchange were up at the start of trading on Tuesday, in the first session since the contest to elect the country's next president narrowed to two candidates, including business-friendly construction magnate Rodolfo Hernandez.Leftist Gustavo Petro, who has promised profound social and economic change, won 40.3% of votes in Sunday's first round, while Hernandez, who has drawn support for his promises to tackle corruption, unexpectedly tallied 28.2%.Hernandez, already backed by former center-right candidate Federico Gutierrez and likely many of his supporters, may be tough for Petro to beat.
