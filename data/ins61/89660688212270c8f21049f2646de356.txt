One month into living together in South Dakota was enough for a couple on TLC's 90 Day Fiancé.

Jibri, 28, from Rapid City, and Miona, 23, from Serbia, had about 55 days until the end of their 90 days at the start of Sunday's episode, and a lot had happened since we last saw them.

Miona and Jibri agreed to leave South Dakota to work with Jibri's band, Black Serbs, in Chicago making music. I that decision, however, came at the cost of the beach wedding Miona had been arguing for in the previous episodes.
