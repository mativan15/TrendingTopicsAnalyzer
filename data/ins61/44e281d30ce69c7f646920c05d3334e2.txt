US tech giant Amazon said Thursday that it will stop operating its Kindle e-bookstore in China from next year, closing the chapter on a massive consumer market.The e-commerce pioneer has in recent years appeared to admit defeat to local Chinese rivals such as Alibaba and JD.com, ending its online retail operations for Chinese consumers in 2019.Amazon's decision to pull the Kindle service comes about eight years after it first set up an official store for the e-book reader on Alibaba's Tmall platform.
