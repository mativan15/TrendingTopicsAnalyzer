Halifax has announced changes to parking rules in the city — including the chance to waive some parking tickets.
In a Wednesday morning release, the city said municipality residents who spend $35 at a business within three hours of getting a parking ticket for a pay station violation in the area can apply to have the ticket fee waived.This comes as small businesses in Halifax Regional Municipality make an effort to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The HRM said this program will support that recovery.
