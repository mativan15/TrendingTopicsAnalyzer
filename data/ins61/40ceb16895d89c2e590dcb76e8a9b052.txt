Even when a business is losing money, it's possible for shareholders to make money if they buy a good business at the right price. For example, Neuren Pharmaceuticals (ASX:NEU) shareholders have done very well over the last year, with the share price soaring by 189%. But while history lauds those rare successes, those that fail are often forgotten; who remembers Pets.com?

So notwithstanding the buoyant share price, we think it's well worth asking whether Neuren Pharmaceuticals' cash burn is too risky.
