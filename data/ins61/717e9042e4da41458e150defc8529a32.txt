The 49ers won't rely on cornerback Jason Verrett in 2022 as they did in 2021. He began last year as a starter, but a torn ACL in Week 1 took him out for the rest of the year. San Francisco re-signed him this offseason and while their CB depth has improved and Verrett's role has diminished, the veteran corner is still making an impact at the position.

It's still very early in the offseason program and OTAs are still underway with mandatory minicamp scheduled for mid-June. The on-field work is pretty limited and pads haven't even come on, but there's a ton of classroom work going on and 49ers secondary coach Corey Undlin told Jennifer Lee Chan at NBC Sports Bay Area that Verrett is making his life easier as a coach.
