Published: 16:07 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 16:10 EDT, 21 October 2022 Ethics watchdogs have struggled to prevent multiple US officials serving under both Presidents Trump and Biden from holding past the legal limit in stocks while they attempt to serve the country. An investigation found that over 2,600 federal officials hold stock in companies that could be seen as conflict of interest with their work in Washington, across several agencies. There are supposed to be financial and carceral penalties for breaking stock trading rules for government officials, but rarely does anyone suffer the $50,000 or five-years in prison maximum.
