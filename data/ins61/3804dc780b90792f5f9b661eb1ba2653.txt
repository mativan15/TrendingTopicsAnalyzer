Customers at Chipotle will now be able to pay for their burritos with cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ether, and dogecoin, in a move that could help crypto become more mainstream, according to trade publication Restaurant Business. But there's just one important caveat: Chipotle will accept the crypto through a payments system called Flexa, which is far from the decentralized technology that crypto supporters have promised for over a decade.Flexa announced the arrangement with Chipotle in a blog post on Wednesday and one Twitter user in Florida even posted a video yesterday showing how the process works.
