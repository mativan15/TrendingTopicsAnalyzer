MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish lenders are open to extending loan repayments for vulnerable households that experience a rise of at least 30% in variable mortgage costs, three sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.

The proposal is part of a wider set of measures aimed at helping exposed families cope with an increase in interest rates and rising cost of living that banks are discussing with government.
