Cathay Pacific is the latest international airline to resume its passenger services in New Zealand after a two-year pause due to the pandemic. The airline's first flight from Hong Kong is scheduled to touch down in Auckland on Sunday morning, with the outbound flight to take off at 1.45pm on Monday. The airline previously announced it would be operating two flights to and from Hong Kong in June, adding to one existing Air New Zealand-operated codeshare flight per week. It hoped to add more flights in subsequent months.
