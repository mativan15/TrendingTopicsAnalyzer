With the addition of Jalen Brunson, the Knicks believe they have fixed a decades-old problem at the all-important point guard spot. After a lengthy list of journeymen and past-their-prime players failed to fill the void, the Knicks are convinced the former Mavericks guard can excel for them.
On opening night, Brunson became the 13th different starter at point guard for the franchise since 2009. The new era began with Brunson recording 15 points, nine assists and six rebounds and drawing a game-saving charge at the end of regulation in a 115-112 overtime loss to the Grizzlies.
