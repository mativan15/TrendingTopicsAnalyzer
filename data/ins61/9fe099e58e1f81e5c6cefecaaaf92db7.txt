When Boris Johnson resigned as prime minister three and a half months ago, some naively believed the most chaotic days of Conservative government were over. Compared with the six white-knuckle weeks of the Liz Truss project, however, the Johnson years may start to feel like the good old days of calm and order.That's what the former prime minister seems to be hoping, at least, as he scrambles home from holidaying in the Caribbean, apparently in a an attempt to reclaim the keys to Downing Street.So it may be worth recalling the reasons why no fewer than 57 of Johnson's ministers resigned from his government in July to force him out of Downing Street, believing his leadership no longer tenable.
