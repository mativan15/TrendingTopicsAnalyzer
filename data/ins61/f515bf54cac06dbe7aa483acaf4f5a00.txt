Tesla chief Elon Musk has recommitted to providing Starlink satellite internet service to war-torn Ukraine days after complaining that it was too expensive for his company.

'The h*** with it … even though Starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we'll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free,' the multibillionaire tweeted yesterday.

SpaceX had reportedly written to the US Pentagon last month asking the US military to cover its satellite internet costs in Ukraine, estimating it would come to about $400m for the next year.
