Pittsburgh police plan to crack down on East Carson Street this weekend, and Target 11 investigator Rick Earle has learned they won't be using undercover patrols, but saturation patrols.

Beginning at 10 p.m. Friday, more Pittsburgh police officers in full uniform will be patrolling on East Carson Street on the South Side. The show of force is meant to address the recent uptick in violence in that area, especially during the evening hours when bars and restaurants are filled with customers. East Carson Street is a popular nightspot in the city.
