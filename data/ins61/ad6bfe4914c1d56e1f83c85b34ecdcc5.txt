Across seven decades of turmoil and change, one thing about China's leadership has remained unchanged. It is all male.Men led China into the famine of the Great Leap Forward, through the convulsions of the Cultural Revolution and during the economic opening of the 1980s and 90s. In Xi Jinping's 'new era' of digital authoritarianism, men remain in charge of the country.The Communist party has run China for 70 years, and in that time no woman has ever been a member of China's Politburo Standing Committee, the small group that runs the country, much less led the party or been made President or Premier.
