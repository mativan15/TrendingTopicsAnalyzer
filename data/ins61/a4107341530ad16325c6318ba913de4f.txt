R. Kelly's former business manager asked a federal judge to award him $850,000 in attorneys fees after a jury acquitted him during the same trial in Chicago at which the R&B singer was convicted of child pornography charges. Derrel McDavid's attorney wrote that deserves to recoup the legal fees after enduring a 'frivolous, vexatious and bad faith prosecution over which he prevailed.' Attorney Beau Brindley filed the 18-page request with U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber late Monday (Oct. 17), the Chicago Sun-Times reported.
