UKRAINE'S DEFENCE ministry recently released unusual aerial footage of the war in Donbas. It did not show Ukraine's successes against Russia, but rather its vulnerabilities: pockmarked fields being blasted by salvos of Russian rockets. 'This is what the largest and most horrific war of the 21st century looks like,' said the tweet on May 26th. 'Ukraine is ready to strike back. To do this, we need NATO-style MLRS. Immediately.'Belatedly, Western allies are responding to such pleas. President Joe Biden announced on May 31st that he would send 'more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine.
