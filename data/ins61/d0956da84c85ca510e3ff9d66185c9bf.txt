The armored car was making a money pick-up at the Bank of America branch at 23800 S. Vermont Ave. about 11:15 a.m. when the armed guard was confronted by two male suspects wearing ski masks, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. ``At least one of the suspects immediately opened fire on the guard with an unknown type firearm, striking the guard multiple times in his lower extremities,'' according to the sheriff's department.
