Lee Da-hee (L.U.C.A.: The Beginning) and Super Junior member Choi Si-won share the screen in the new romantic comedy Love is for Suckers, playing a reality-TV producer and a plastic surgeon who are close friends and neighbours. Just as in the currently airing The Law Cafe and countless other cohabitation romcoms that have preceded it, their characters share a long history and presently live in the same building in a landlord-renter arrangement. It's clear to most people around them that they share a special connection, but they remain oblivious to that fact.
