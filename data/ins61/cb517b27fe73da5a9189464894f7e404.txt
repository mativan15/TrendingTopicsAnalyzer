Film director Indra Kumar revealed in a new interview that people told him to think twice before hiring Sidharth Malhotra for his new film Thank God, because the actor doesn't have a track record in the comedy genre.
After directing 90s' romance films such as Beta, Raja and Ishq, Indra Kumar had a career resurgence with slapstick comedies such as Dhamaal, Grand Masti, Great Grand Masti and Total Dhamaal. In an interview with Siddharth Kannan, the filmmaker was asked who has the better comic timing between Sidharth Malhotra and Riteish Deshmukh.
