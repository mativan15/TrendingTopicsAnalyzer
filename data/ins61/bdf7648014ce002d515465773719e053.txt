The political ramifications of such a raid were also unpredictable. The attorney general at the time, Sir Michael Havers, later Lord Havers, was believed to have opposed any attack on Argentina, itself.
Undertaking such an operation would have been fraught with diplomatic risk. British aircraft were unable to cross Brazilian, Paraguayan or Uruguayan airspace but just two weeks after the plans were drawn up, a Vulcan taking part in the sixth Black Buck raid was forced to land in Rio de Janeiro after its refuelling probe broke.
