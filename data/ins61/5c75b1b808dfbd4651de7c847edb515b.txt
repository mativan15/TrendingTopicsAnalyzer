HONG KONG, Oct 19 (Reuters) - China stocks closed lower on Wednesday, as investors were cautious amid uncertainties during the Communist Party Congress, even as a raft of state-backed and large asset managers announced measures to stabilise the market.

Hong Kong shares also snapped a three-day rally after the city's leader delivered his first policy address, as economic stimulus measures failed to boost sentiment.

** China's blue-chip CSI 300 Index dropped 1.
