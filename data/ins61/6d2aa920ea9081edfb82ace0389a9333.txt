Over the last 24 hours, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis made it harder for transgender people to get Medicaid support, canceled funding for a Tampa Bay Rays practice stadium because of the team's anti-gun violence tweet and threatened the Special Olympics with a $27.5 million fine over coronavirus vaccine requirements.He shooed away protesters who demanded action on gun violence by telling them that "nobody wants to hear from you," and he also signed the state's largest budget at $101.5 billion. "We've got a lot of stuff going on in the state of Florida," DeSantis said at a news conference Friday, highlighting the state's robust economy, buoyed by high tourism numbers and an infusion of federal covid relief money.
