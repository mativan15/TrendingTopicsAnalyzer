Even professional athletes struggle to find housing in Vancouver. A former NFL player who is now a cornerback for the CFL's BC Lions used social media to ask for help in his search. Delvin Breaux vented his frustrations on Twitter Sunday, writing, "Boy it's hard looking for places in Vancouver!" Breaux, who has also played with the CFL's Hamilton Tiger-Cats and the NFL's New Orleans Saints, told CTV News he's been looking all over Metro Vancouver for two months. "It definitely tough and it sucks," Breaux said from Lions' training camp in Kamloops.
