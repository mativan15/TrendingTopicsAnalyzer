In a gritty neighborhood of Nairobi known for fixing cars and selling auto parts, businesses are struggling and customers are unhappy. With the Kenyan shilling down 6% this year, the cost of fuel and imported spare parts is soaring so much that some people are choosing to ditch their cars and take public transportation. "This has been the worst," said Michael Gachie, purchasing manager with Shamas Auto Parts. "Customers are complaining a lot.'' With business dropping and less money coming in, Albert Chege _ another auto parts dealer in Nairobi _ said he's no longer able to take his four children on vacation.
