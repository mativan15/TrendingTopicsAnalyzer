A specialty tea spot is slated for a location in the Dayton area.

Chatime, a bubble tea business, will be opening in a shopping center anchored by a Kroger at 4454 Brandt Pike near Harshman Road in Huber Heights.

The business will employ about four part-time employees when it opens in January or February, the owner said.

This will be the first location in the Dayton area and the only one in the region.

The Taiwanese-based franchise teahouse company has more than 1,000 locations in 50 countries.
