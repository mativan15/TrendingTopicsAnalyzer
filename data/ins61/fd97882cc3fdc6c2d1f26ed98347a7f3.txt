The 49ers are getting a few key players back as they take on the Chiefs this weekend.

Edge rusher Nick Bosa (groin), offensive tackle Trent Williams (ankle), and safety Jimmie Ward (hand) are all off the injury report and set to play in Sunday's game.

Bosa missed last week's loss with the groin injury. Williams has been out since Week Three. And Ward played only a couple of snaps in the Week Five game against Carolina.
