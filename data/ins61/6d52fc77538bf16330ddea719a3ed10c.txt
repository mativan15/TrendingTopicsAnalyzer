Paddy Pimblett's UFC London opponent Jordan Leavitt has admitted that he is 'kind of offended' to have been paired with the Liverpudlian.

Pimblett has become one of the UFC's fastest-rising stars over the last year, going 2-0 in the promotion with two first-round wins.

The 27-year-old knocked out Luigi Vendramini last September then submitted Rodrigo Vargas in London in March. The UFC will return to the English capital in July for another event at the O2 Arena, where 'Paddy The Baddy' will take on Leavitt.
