Massachusetts ultimately received the hand sanitizer it ordered, as well as an $18,000 'donation' from the company.

After receiving more than $15 million to supply Massachusetts with masks at the start of the pandemic, a company allegedly bought the masks with state funds and never delivered them, according to the attorney general's office.

In court documents filed Monday, Attorney General Maura Healey's office said it is investigating USiDG LLC, which was incorporated in Wyoming on March 16, 2020 — just days after Gov.
