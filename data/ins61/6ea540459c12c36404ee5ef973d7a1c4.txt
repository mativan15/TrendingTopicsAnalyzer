Oct. 14—MORGANTOWN — Up until Thursday night, Baylor's run defense had been as menacing as the old Steel Curtain of the Pittsburgh Steelers' glory days.

No player had even approached 100 yards rushing on the Bears this season. Heck, few teams had gained 100.

And West Virginia was without its freshman sensation, as running back C.J. Donaldson was still recovering from his scary concussion suffered against Texas.

No way was WVU going to move the ball on the ground. Someone forgot to tell that to Tony Mathis Jr.
