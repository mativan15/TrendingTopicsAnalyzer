A comedian tried to give Georgia Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker condoms on stage after a campaign event. On Thursday, Jason Selvig, of the comedy duo The Good Liars, appeared onstage alongside Mr Walker at a campaign stop in Macon, Georgia. While there, he attempted to hand the former NFL star some prophylactics. The pair appeared to talk for a short time before Mr Walker walked away to talk to other people.The stunt comes after allegations broke in recent weeks that Mr Walker paid for and urged a woman to have two separate abortions, despite saying he's pro-life on the campaign trail.
