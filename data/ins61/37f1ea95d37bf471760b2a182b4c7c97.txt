Vancouver police officers could soon find themselves packing a high-tech new piece of gear, if the city's new mayor has his way.
At his first public press conference Monday, mayor-elect Ken Sim pledged to equip Vancouver police officers with body-worn cameras 24-7 by the summer of 2025.'It actually approves accountability, not only for the police officers but also for the public at large,' Sim said.Body-worn cameras have become a regular feature of policing in the United States, and police forces in Calgary and Toronto have already adopted them.
