Pakistan's Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial on May 27 observed that Cabinet members have no Constitutional immunity under Article 248 of the Constitution and criminal proceedings against them should proceed as per the provisions of the law. Chief Justice Bandial made these observations in the Supreme Court during the hearing of the five-member Bench on a suo motu notice on the perceived apprehension of "persons in authority" undermining the criminal justice system.
