An insurance and wealth management company's office in Palm Beach Gardens grew 20 times larger as the company prepares to grow its presence in South Florida.

New York-based NFP moved this fall into a 20,000-square-foot office into DiVosta's North Tower at 3835 PGA Blvd., said Bill Austin, managing director of NFP South Florida. NFP, which has $50 billion in assets under management, previously occupied a 1,200-square-foot office in Palm Beach Gardens.

"There will be 40-plus employees working at our Palm Beach Gardens office with expertise in employee benefits, property and casualty, retirement plan advisory, life insurance, estate planning, and wealth management," Austin said.
