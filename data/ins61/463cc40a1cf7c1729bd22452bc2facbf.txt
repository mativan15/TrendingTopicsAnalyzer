The jury in Kevin Spacey's sexual abuse trial found that the Oscar-winning actor is not liable for battery against 'Star Trek: Discovery star' Anthony Rapp.

The jury of five men and six women deliberated for just under 90 minutes on Thursday afternoon. Rapp appeared stoic as the verdict was read and his lawyers seemed dejected as they left the courthouse in downtown Manhattan.

Spacey could be seen hugging one of his lawyers after the verdict was announced.

'I'm very grateful to the jury for seeing through these false allegations,' Spacey's attorney Jennifer Keller said.
