Focusing on "Customer-centric founders redefining everyday experiences," venture firm Hannah Grey told me it just closed its oversubscribed $51.6 million fund. The company's thesis focuses on "studying macro-societal forcing functions and evolving human behavior to identify areas of opportunities."

The team told me it was planning to raise $25 million but found a lot more interest for its thesis, eventually closing more than twice that. The firm is backed by LPs such as Screendoor Partners, JPMorgan, Twitter, Carta, Stagwell Group, Insight Partners, Equity Alliance, and other foundations, fund of funds, family offices and strategic industry veterans.
