The aide to former President Donald Trump who moved boxes of government records from a storage room in Mar-a-Lago in surveillance footage that prompted the FBI's raid on the resort was identified in multiple reports. Citing a source familiar with the investigation, CBS News on Monday confirmed reports in the The New York Times and The Washington Post that identified Walt Nauta, a former White House staffer turned Trump aide, as the staffer who moved the records. The reports say that Nauta is cooperating with the Justice Department's investigation into Trump's retention of thousands of government records after leaving office.
