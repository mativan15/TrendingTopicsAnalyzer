A woman who was shot earlier this year in an attack on a New York City subway is suing the manufacturer of the gun used in the crime, claiming the injuries she suffered were "a direct" result of the company's marketing and sales tactics. Ilene Steur was one of ten people shot of the 29 injured when a suspect opened fire on a train in Brooklyn on April 12. Prosecutors say the alleged perpetrator, Frank James, used a Glock 17 pistol in the incident, and that he purchased the handgun legally from an Ohio pawn shop in 2011.
