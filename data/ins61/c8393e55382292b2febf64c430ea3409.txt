Amy Schumer is calling attention to the issues that matter.

The Emmy Award winner, 41, referenced the recent courtroom drama between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard while advocating for gun control Friday on Instagram, tagging Everytown for Gun Safety in the wake of last week's Uvalde school shooting.

"FYI I did not watch a second of that trial," Schumer wrote in a Notes app statement.
