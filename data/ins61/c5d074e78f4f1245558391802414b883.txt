The Real Housewives franchise is used to new faces — even on the same person — but never has an entire cast been replaced. Until now.

At BravoCon, the legally-sanctioned fight club for gays and divorcees, overlord Andy Cohen brought out the new ladies jogging through Manhattan's elite circles for season 14 of The Real Housewives of New York.

Cohen had previously warned that this was happening back in March when he disclosed that the Housewives of New York would be completely booted and rebooted.
