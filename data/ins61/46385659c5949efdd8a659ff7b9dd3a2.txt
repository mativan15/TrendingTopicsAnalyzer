June 01, 2022 10:20 AM Eastern Daylight Time SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Investment platform Streetbeat has partnered with Sperax, a market tested and 100% collateralized DeFi product that provides a 11% yield, paid weekly. Sperax's novel auto-yield USDs stablecoin allows investors on the Streetbeat platform to benefit from passive income without technical or financial expertise.

Unlike many stablecoins that suffer from being algorithmic based or whose collatoralization is off chain and opaque, Sperax's USDs is US-dollar pegged, operated fully on-chain, and is a fully crypto-collateralized stablecoin designed to overcome market conditions with continuous yields.
