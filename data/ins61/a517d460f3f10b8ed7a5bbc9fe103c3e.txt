May 26—A federal jury in Philadelphia has convicted a former Berks County man on 30 counts of fraud, money laundering and identity theft, agreeing with prosecutors that he employed an elaborate scheme to steal money from his own financial advisory clients.

Jason Weigand, 51, of Denver, Lancaster County, was indicted by a grand jury in October 2017, and while out on bail committed additional fraud, resulting in a second indictment. He was living in Sinking Spring when he committed the crimes covered in the initial indictment, according to court records.
