NEW YORK (AP) — A complex of giant tents built on an island opened Wednesday as New York City's latest temporary shelter for an influx of international migrants being bused into the city by southern border states.

The humanitarian relief center on Randall's Island is intended to be a temporary waystation for single, adult men — many from Venezuela — who have been arriving several times per week on buses chartered predominantly from Texas.

Spartan and utilitarian, the tents include cots for up to 500 people, laundry facilities, a dining hall and phones for residents to make international calls.
