The big shareholder groups in MA Financial Group Limited (ASX:MAF) have power over the company. Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don't tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.

MA Financial Group is a smaller company with a market capitalization of AU$992m, so it may still be flying under the radar of many institutional investors.
