While diamonds last forever, that is not the case for a jewelry business run by three generations of the Sandberg family.

Thus, Susan Sandberg, the owner of Sandberg Jewelers in the Village Crossing Shopping Center on Skokie's Carpenter Road, is moving on and will close the store by end of the year, albeit with some sadness.

'I love the jewelry business, I love my clients; they are like family,' Sandberg said.

Philip Sr. and Frank Sandberg opened the family business on Chicago's Milwaukee Avenue in 1919.
