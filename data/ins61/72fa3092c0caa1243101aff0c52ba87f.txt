In a PlayStation Blog post reflecting on the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves' Collection PC port, Naughty Dog said the company is still focused on developing games for the PlayStation 5. This is no surprise as Naughty Dog has been owned by Sony since 2001, and its games have been PlayStation exclusives at launch for that stretch of time.But with the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves port, co-developed with Iron Galaxy, and the upcoming, but currently unreleased, The Last of Us Part I PC port, Naughty Dog said it wants to also serve PC players--a move the company stated is an important part of how it'll release games going forward.
