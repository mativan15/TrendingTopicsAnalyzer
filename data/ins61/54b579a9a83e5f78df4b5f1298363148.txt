The Miami Hurricanes are hoping to snap their losing streak on the road.

Mario Cristobal's first season at the U hasn't gone as planned. After starting the season with two convincing wins, the 'Canes have dropped three in a row, including last week's 27-24 loss to North Carolina. Quarterback Tyler Van Dyke had a stellar day, throwing for 496 yards and three touchdowns, but it wasn't enough to break the slide.

Miami (2-3, 0-2 ACC) now heads to Blacksburg to take on Virginia Tech (2-4, 1-2). The Hokies are also on a three-game losing skid, falling last week 45-29 to Pittsburgh.
