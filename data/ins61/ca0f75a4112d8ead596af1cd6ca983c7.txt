Jeremy Hunt has revealed he is reversing "almost all" of the tax cuts announced in his predecessor's mini-budget and is scaling back support for energy bills.In an emergency statement, the chancellor said a 1p cut to income tax will be delayed "indefinitely" until the UK's finances improve instead of being introduced in April 2023 as announced in Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget three weeks ago.
Mr Hunt, who only stepped into the job on Friday, said the government's energy price guarantee will only be universal until April - not for two years as originally planned.
