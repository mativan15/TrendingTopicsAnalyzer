Hans Niemann, the US 19-year-old accused by world champion Magnus Carlsen of being a cheat, has fought back in the second half of the US championship in St Louis.From next to bottom after seven rounds, Niemann improved to 4.5/10, and drew his games against four of the five members of the US Olympiad team. Of that squad, only the former world No2 Fabiano Caruana, who led the field after 10 of the 13 rounds, defeated Niemann, after the teenager missed several chances for a level position.
