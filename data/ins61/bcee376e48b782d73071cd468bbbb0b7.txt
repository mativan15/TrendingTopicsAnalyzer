FOXBOROUGH — In his first time speaking with the media since the day after he suffered a high ankle sprain, Mac Jones said he's progressing and looking to play in Monday's game against the Bears.

'I'm going to try and do my best to put the hours in and (get) ready,' Jones said Friday. 'I'm definitely moving better and feeling good.'

Jones also said that his ankle 'feels pretty good.'

'I'm just trying to work through all the stuff to be able to play in an NFL football game,' Jones said.
