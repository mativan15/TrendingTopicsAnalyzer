Organised crime groups are taking millions of pounds of taxpayers' money through unregulated supported accommodation for vulnerable people, police have revealed.Criminals have been cashing in on the recent boom in 'exempt accommodation', designed to support vulnerable people such as prison leavers, recovering addicts and those fleeing domestic violence. Providers can claim higher rates of housing benefit for these properties, but there are major concerns about the quality of support. Police say that criminal gangs are buying properties and setting them up as supported accommodation to receive the higher rates, but provide little to no support for the vulnerable tenants.
