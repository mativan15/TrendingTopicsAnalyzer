The two men, who were sophomores, went off on a trail looking for deer and elk antlers. Remarkably, they were also on the Northwestern College Wrestling team. The station said that their teammates were also in the national forest but were separated at the time of the grizzly bear attack. One injured man is from Wyoming, Evanston, named Kendell Cummings. The other man is Utah's Brady Lowry. The grizzly bear first attacked Brady Lowry, and as Kendell Cummings tried to save Lowry by jumping onto the grizzly's back, it led the bear to attack Cummings.
