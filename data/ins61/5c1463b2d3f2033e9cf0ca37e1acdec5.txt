It's hard to believe Need For Speed Unbound is coming out soon, partially because its reveal was only last week. As such, Electronic Arts (EA) is looking to shift the hype into overdrive with a new teaser.
On Tuesday, EA released another Need for Speed Unbound trailer. This one focuses on risk and reward gameplay mechanics, specifically how messing with cops increases your notorious reputation. Avoiding a trip to the slammer will net extra spending money too. So successfully evading the police isn't just for show — even if bragging rights are always a plus.
