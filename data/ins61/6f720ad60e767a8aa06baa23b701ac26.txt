The former rugby player — who celebrates his 44th birthday on October 18 — has been tipped to be heading into the jungle this year, a move that would make him the first member of the Royal Family to appear on ITV's 'I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here'. But Mike Tindall is no stranger to reality TV – he participated in the 2015 series of ‘Bear Grylls: Mission Survive', a show that puts eight celebrities to the test on the fundamental principles of survival. The contestants undertook a voyage within the rainforests of Costa Rica and faced several challenges which pushed them to 'their physical and emotional limits'.
