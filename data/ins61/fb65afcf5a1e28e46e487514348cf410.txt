VioletaStoimenovaShares of HireRight (NYSE:HRT) have done quite alright for an IPO name which went public last year, as shares have been trading largely flattish in its first year after going public. This is quite an achievement given the performance of the market and certainly IPO names over this period of time. In November of last year I concluded that the prospects for this IPO looked alright amidst a solid performance of the underlying business, with appeal improving amidst a non-demanding price.
