Selling Sunset's Christine Quinn has no regrets over quitting the Oppenheim Group and insists that she's just ‘happy to be free.' 
Following the explosive season five reunion, real estate broker Jason Oppenheim confirmed that the 33-year-old no longer ‘has a place' at the company.
The luxury realtor has revealed that she and husband Christian Richard have set up their own business together, announcing the news with cryptic comments about being your own boss.
Although the star isn't part of the agency anymore, she recently reassured fans that she'll be back but she will have to be ‘creative' about her comeback.
