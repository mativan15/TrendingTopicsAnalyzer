Review informationTime played: 5 1/2 hours Platform: PC I've been crawling around the deep and dark catacombs riddled with rats, disease, and death. Each step is painfully slow, as I crawl forwards, armed with only a torch that is burning out fast. I'm searching the crypt for medicine for my little brother, Hugo.  I manage to avoid the swarms of gnawing rats, that move in the darkness like water, and make my way to the surface. I don't have much time to take in my victory as, once my eyes adjust to the awe-inspiring scene of a derelict and torch-lit pantheon, I see what lies among the ruins.
