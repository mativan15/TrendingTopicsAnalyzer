The Federal Trade Commission provides the following advice on its website on how to avoid crypto rip-offs. Much of it matches up with other sources.

▪ No one should ask you to pay for something in advance with cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency payments do not come with legal protections, like debit cads and credit cards. If something goes wrong — meaning you don't get what is promised — you are probably out of luck.

▪ Before buying something with crypto, research the seller's reputation. For instance, a search of Ryan 'Brody' Crawford's Miami-Dade court online record would show lawsuits over sizable bum checks written on a defunct account.
