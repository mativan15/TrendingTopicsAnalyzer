Paras Porwal, the 57-year-old Mumbai-based builder who allegedly died by suicide on Thursday, was a prominent real estate developer who mainly carried out redevelopment projects in the city.
A migrant from Rajasthan, Porwal spent his initial years in Mumbai in a chawl at Ambewadi in Kalachowki and sold imitation jewellery on local trains. He rose from his humble beginnings to become a popular face in the city's real estate and political circles in the 90s.
Porwal started his career with minor construction-related work like providing flooring tiles to other developers.
