Published: 21:10 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 21:10 EDT, 17 October 2022 Outgoing Manly NRL coach Des Hasler has rejected the payout offered by the Sea Eagles and is set to 'go for the jugular' with his lawyer demanding the club compensate his client with $1 million.Since his sacking last week, Hasler remains in Western Australia on holiday and has enlisted the services of Sydney lawyer Daniel McGirr who made the demand to Manly on Monday.It might not end there, with News Corp reporting that McGirr might also seek damages on top of the money owed for Hasler's 2023 contract which could result in a long and ugly court battle between the parties.
