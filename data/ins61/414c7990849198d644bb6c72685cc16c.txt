The only member of the G-23 to back Tharoor for the Congress presidential poll, scheduled to be held on October 17, Sandeep Dikshit says it was never a political group and people also joined it for personal grudges, lists Tharoor's strengths, and compares Delhi under AAP to when his mother Sheila Dikshit was Congress CM. Excerpts:
* You are the only member of the so-called G-23 group which backed Shashi Tharoor for the Congress presidency. Why?
When I heard that Mr Tharoor was offering his name as a candidate, about 10-15 days ago, I approached him.
