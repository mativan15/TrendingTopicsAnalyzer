The Pune zilla parishad has launched a portal ‘Majhi ZP, Majha Adhikar' for social audit of public works and feedback of a work.
'The portal was launched by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar recently. Its objective is to carry out social audit of public works and elicit feedback of the work,' zilla parishad CEO Ayush Prasad told The Indian Express.
Prasad said a citizen can login to the Mahalabharthi Part of the Pune zilla parishad's website and click on the tab ‘Majhi ZP, Majha Adhikar'. 'A citizen can select the taluka and village to see the works executed by the Pune zila parishad,' he said.
