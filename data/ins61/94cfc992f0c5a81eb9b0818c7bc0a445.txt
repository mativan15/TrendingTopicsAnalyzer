The race for Florida commissioner of agriculture and consumer services is pretty lackluster.

With one unprepared candidate and another who won't explain his record, the Herald Editorial Board will not issue a recommendation ahead of the Nov. 8 elections.

Democrats have put little effort into finding, and funding, a candidate for this and other Florida Cabinet posts.
