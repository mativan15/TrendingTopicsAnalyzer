David Atkinson with his award

A FORCES' veteran, academic and entrepreneur has been named 'Inspiration of the Year' for his work which has included breaking down barriers surrounding autism.

Dr David Atkinson's pioneering work aims to enable employers to recognise and benefit from the enterprise potential of autistic and other neurodiverse graduates.

The award caps a remarkable turnaround for Dr Atkinson, 64, of Thirsk, North Yorkshire, who was declared bankrupt five years ago after his restaurant business went into liquidation and he was diagnosed with autism.
