May 27—WATERTOWN — Few things have the power to occupy a parent's mind more than the health of their children.

The nationwide infant formula shortage, brought on by supply chain issues and a major formula recall, has left many concerned about their options for feeding their little ones. Northern New York has not been immune to what has become a common sight in grocery stores across the country: empty spaces on shelves that used to be filled by infant formula. At Price Chopper and other stores in the north country, signs tell customers to see a sales associate to have them unlock the formula they need — if it's in stock — and customers are only allowed to buy a certain amount at any given time.
