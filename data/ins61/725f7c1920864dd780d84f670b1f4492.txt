It's now clearer just how Capcom will handle the Resident Evil 4 remake. Both a story trailer from Capcom and a gameplay preview from IGN show that the developer isn't messing with the core mechanics of the 2005 classic even as ramps up the horror. While the re-do is certainly creepier (particularly in cutscenes), the hectic action of the original RE4 appears to be intact. You're fighting hordes of infected villagers who won't hesitate to gut you with a chainsaw or pitchfork.

The remake still revolves around agent Leon Kennedy's mission to rescue the US President's daughter, Ashley Graham, from a Spanish village controlled by a parasite-worshipping cult.
