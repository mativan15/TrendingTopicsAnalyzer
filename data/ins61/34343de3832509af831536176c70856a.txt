Earlier this week, Alastair Lewis, professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of York, argued that particulate matter emitted from electric car tyres is a massive risk to public health. He therefore suggested that it posed a larger problem than CO2 emissions coming from petrol and diesel cars, calling for a new tax to be introduced.Professor Lewis said charges for low emission zones are likely to be replaced with alternative levies as drivers switch to electric vehicles.Despite this, many were concerned about the proposals put forward by, saying it was harmful to the continued rollout of electric cars.
