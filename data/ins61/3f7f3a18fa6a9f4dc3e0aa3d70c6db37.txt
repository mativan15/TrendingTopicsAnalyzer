Fortnite parent company Epic Games has accused Google of deleting employee chats that it alleges would have served as evidence in the continuing lawsuit between the companies.In a new filing reported earlier Friday by Yelp senior vice president of public policy Luther Lowe, Epic Games alleges that Google employees used Google Chat to communicate and intentionally let those conversations be wiped after 24 hours, which is the default setting."Any administrator of Google Chats -- an application developed by Google -- could have changed this default setting at any point for all custodians.
