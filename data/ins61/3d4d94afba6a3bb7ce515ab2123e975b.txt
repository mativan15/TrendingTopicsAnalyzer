PUNE: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Friday visited Pune to persuade industry to invest in his state, saying that there can be healthy competition among the states in terms of inviting investment/industry. The chief minister also assured investors that they will not have to face any trouble from anti-social elements as the latter are now scared of his government's bulldozer action. Chouhan's visit came barely days after mining giant Vedanta Ltd. selected Gujarat over Maharashtra for setting up its semiconductor manufacturing facility as part of its $20 billion joint-venture (JV) with Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer, Foxconn.
