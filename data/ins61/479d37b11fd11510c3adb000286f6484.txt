A report that Elon Musk may cut almost 75% of Twitter's workforce if and when he takes over, along with more grim news from Snap sent social media companies tumbling in premarket trading early Friday.

Futures for the benchmark S&P 500 slid 0.8% while futures for the Dow dipped 0.7%. Futures for the tech-heavy Nasdaq skidded 1.3%.

The Washington Post reported Thursday that Musk has told prospective investors in his Twitter purchase that he plans to cut nearly 75% of Twitter's employee base of 7,500 workers, leaving the company with a skeleton crew.
