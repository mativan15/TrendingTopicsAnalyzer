 British Prime Minister Liz Truss has resigned just 45 days into her premiership, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in the nation's history. Truss' resignation came one day after the Conservative Party leader vowed she was "a fighter and not a quitter," and amid an increasing chorus of voices calling on her to step down. Truss, 47, was selected in September to replace former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who agreed two months earlier to step down as the British prime minister as soon as a new leader was chosen.
