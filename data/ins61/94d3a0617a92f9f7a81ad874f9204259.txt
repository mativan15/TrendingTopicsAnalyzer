Journalists tend to be snobbish about politicians who begin their careers in local government, but being a councillor provides a first-class political education.In particular, it forces you to test whatever values and favourite policies you have acquired against real-world problems that are not of your choosing.So far so good. I typed that a couple of days ago, intending to add the observation that Liz Truss would not be such a callow ideologue if she had served as a councillor and post it.Then I told myself that I was being silly.
