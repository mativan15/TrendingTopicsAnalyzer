Australia's central bank surprised markets in early October with a smaller-than-expected rate hike, a move the Reserve Bank of Australia acknowledged was a "finely balanced" debate even as it vowed to keep inflation in check.

According to RBA minutes from the Oct. 4 meeting that were released Tuesday, two options were considered before the bank eventually raised its cash rate by 25 basis points to 2.6%, a nine-year high.

It marked the bank's sixth consecutive hike in its tightening cycle to tame global inflation rates.
