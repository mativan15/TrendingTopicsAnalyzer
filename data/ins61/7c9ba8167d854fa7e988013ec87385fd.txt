The Wrap Paul Haggis' civil rape trial got underway Wednesday in New York, where the Oscar-winning 'Crash' director aims to argue that Scientology and greed are behind claims of rape from a publicist and three other women who say he sexually assaulted them in separate incidents dating back to 2013.Opening statements began in the case of publicist Haleigh Breest, who is suing Haggis for unspecified damages, with her own text messages used by lawyers for both sides. Breest, who was an events publicist when she met Haggis at a New York movie premiere in 2013, has chosen to self-identify in the civil lawsuit.
