It's been a tough season for Detroit Lions running back D'Andre Swift. The talented back averaged over 100 total yards per game and scored twice in Detroit's first three games.

Unfortunately for Swift, the injury bug bit him. The third-year RB suffered separate ankle and shoulder injuries that have kept Swift out of the last two games. Swift was back at practice on a limited basis on Wednesday, the first preparation for Sunday's game in Dallas against the Cowboys.

After the practice, Swift talked about his progress and mindset.
