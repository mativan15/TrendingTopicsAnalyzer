By Will Feuer Caesars Entertainment Inc. and real-estate developer SL Green Realty Corp. said they are pursuing a New York gaming license that would allow them to redevelop a Times Square site into a resort casino. The companies said the project would bring billions in tax revenue to New York City and New York State and would help accelerate the economic recovery of the city's midtown neighborhood. SL Green and Caesars said they are also proposing "significant security and traffic improvements." New York City and state politicians have been criticized in recent months over safety concerns throughout the city.
