This would be clothes that are out of season, that the online retail giant has not been able to shift.
Opening a shop would be the first time Asos has opened a physical store in the UK.
José Antonio Ramos Calamonte, who recently took over the running of the business, told The Sun that as well as exploring opening a physical outlet Asos could also start offloading its out of season stock to discount retailers like TK Maxx and flash sale websites.
