Gun violence is a public health crisis.The American Medical Association (AMA), the most influential medical lobbying group in the US, along with other prominent health organizations, has recognized it as such since 2016, when it officially stated that 'uncontrolled ownership and use of firearms, especially handguns, is a serious threat to the public's health inasmuch as the weapons are one of the main causes of intentional and unintentional injuries and deaths.'The AMA (which did not respond to Quartz's request for comment) also officially supports stricter background checks and waiting periods before people purchase guns, as well as stricter enforcement of existing gun laws in order to reduce casualties from shootings.
