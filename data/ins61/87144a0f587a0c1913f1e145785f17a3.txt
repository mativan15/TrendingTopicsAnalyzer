Aranga87 Before commenting on Nel ASA's Q3 performance (OTCPK:NLLSF), we would like to report the following key takeaways: During the half-year result with the new CEO Hakon Volldal, there was a strategy announcement to move forward on stack production. According to our estimates, this will limit the average selling price by 30% with gross margin impacted too. We now forecast an EBITDA break-even point in 2026 (from 2025); Related to point 1), we are expecting an additional equity raise before 2025; For the above reason, Wall Street estimates downgrades are likely to continue - Nel ASA's stock price probably has still too much expectation priced in; In addition, the former company's CEO and current board member Jon Lokke has disinvested almost 75% of his stock during the year.
