A federal judge slapped down a class-action lawsuit that accused the FBI and Justice Department of misleading another magistrate for a warrant to search a private vault facility and ultimately seize roughly $85 million in assets from private citizens.But attorneys for the plaintiffs and those in similar circumstances are warning that the seizures were still improper."The FBI lied about its intentions in claiming to only be interested in the property of the business, and not the [deposit] box holders," Robert Frommer, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a statement before the judge's ruling.
