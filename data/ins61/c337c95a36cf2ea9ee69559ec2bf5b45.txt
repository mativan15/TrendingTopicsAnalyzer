Isaac French, a 25-year-old bookkeeper and contractor, co-owns and operates a "tiny hotel" in Waco, Texas, with seven tiny homes that he opened early this year.Before getting into short-term rentals, French ran a cloud-based accounting business in Waco. But around late 2020, he told Insider, he was itching to take advantage of the hot real-estate market in the area — Waco is within two hours' driving distance of Austin, Fort Worth, and Dallas."I'd had these ideas sort of brewing to create this modern Scandinavian housing concept in Texas," French said.
