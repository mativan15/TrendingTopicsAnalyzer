Roman Kemp has shared that advice he received from his friend, chart-topping singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, has helped him through his battle with depression.
The 29-year-old Capital Breakfast presenter has previously spoken candidly about his mental health struggles and last year released a documentary looking at the mental health crisis affecting young men.
In a new interview, Roman revealed: ‘Ed told me there's dirty water at the top and the more you let it flow it turns into clear water.
‘Each time I speak about how I feel, the water gets clearer.
