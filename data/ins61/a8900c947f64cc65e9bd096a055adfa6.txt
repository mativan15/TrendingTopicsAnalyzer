akinbostanci/iStock via Getty Images The iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (NYSEARCA:IWN) is a U.S. small-cap value index ETF. Small-cap value stocks are the cheapest U.S. equity industry sub-segment, and could outperform as valuations continue to normalize across the market. Small-cap value stocks are also significantly riskier than average, and would likely underperform if economic conditions were to worsen. IWN is a buy, but only appropriate for more aggressive investors. With a measly 1.8% yield, the fund is simply not an effective income vehicle.
