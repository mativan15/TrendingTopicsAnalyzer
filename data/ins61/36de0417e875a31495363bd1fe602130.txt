The teenage student accused of killing four classmates in a shooting rampage at a Michigan high school last year is expected to plead guilty to two dozen charges, authorities said Friday, including terrorism - an extraordinarily unusual if not unprecedented charge in a school shooting.

Oakland County Chief Assistant Prosecutor David Williams said in a statement that Ethan Crumbley, who was 15 when he allegedly opened fire at an Oxford, Mich., school and is being charged as an adult, is expected to plead guilty Monday to four counts of first-degree murder, seven counts of assault with intent to murder, 12 counts of possession of a firearm and one count of terrorism causing death.
