The rising frequency of major outages and data breaches reveals the shoddiness of the tech industry's practices. Regulators could help by treating Facebook and others more like banks. It has been a rough few months for the internet. In June, Fastly Inc.'s content-delivery network failure forced some of the world's biggest e-commerce and media websites offline. Later, there were massive data breaches at T-Mobile US Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.'s Twitch streaming service. And last week, Facebook Inc.'s main social network, Instagram and WhatsApp were down for about six hours.
