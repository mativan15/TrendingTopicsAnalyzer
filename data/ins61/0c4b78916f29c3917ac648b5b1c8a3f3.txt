Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg sought Wednesday to spike persistent rumors that she may run for political office, going beyond previous statements by telling NBC's 'Today' show: 'I have ruled it out. I don't think that's for me.'
The political ambitions of Facebook's chief operating officer have been the subject of recurring speculation, based on her high profile in Silicon Valley, close ties with Democratic power brokers and a potential network of supporters who have joined groups devoted to her best-selling book, 'Lean In,' and its advice for women who want to advance their careers.
