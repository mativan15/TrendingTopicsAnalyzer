Mediation between the Ontario government and education workers has broken down, bringing union employees one step closer to a possible strike. In a statement issued Wednesday afternoon, the bargaining committee said the 'parties are too far apart.' 'Unfortunately, there has not been any movement that the Ford government towards accepting are reasonable, affordable and absolutely necessary proposals for student success and good job,' Laura Walton, president of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) Ontario School Boards Council of Unions, said at a news conference.
