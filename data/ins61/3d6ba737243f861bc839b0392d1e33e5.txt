Michael Jones/iStock Editorial via Getty Images If you have not heard of Winmark Corporation (NASDAQ:WINA), at least you have likely heard of one of the store chains that the company franchises out. These are Plato's Closet, Once Upon A Child, Play It Again Sports, Style Encore, and Music Go Round. With operations spread across the US and Canada, as well as select other locales, the enterprise is a diverse retailer that, after a disappointing 2020 fiscal year, has finally started to show signs of a return to growth.
