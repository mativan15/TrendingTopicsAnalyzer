Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, is buying conservative social media app Parler, a company that touts itself as an 'uncancelable free speech platform.'The announcement comes just over a week since Instagram and Twitter both blocked the Grammy-winning rapper's accounts over anti-semitic posts. Ye, who showed up in a 'White Lives Matter' t-shirt during Paris Fashion week—which he characterized as 'funny' in an interview with right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson—is seeing his politics lean further right by the day.
