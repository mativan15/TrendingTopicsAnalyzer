Ferraris aren't exactly a dime a dozen (well, unless you're at Pebble Beach) but if there's any place where you might expect them to be relatively thick on the ground, it's the company's hometown of Maranello, Italy. Yet as I drive through the compact city center in the new Ferrari 296 GTS, I'm getting nothing but dropped jaws and double takes. Surely this can't be the first time these people have seen a Ferrari.On second thought, perhaps it's the first time they've seen one without hearing it first.
