Harel Insurance Investments and Financial Services Ltd. marked a 28% increase to NIS 327 billion in the first quarter of 2022, according to its Q1 report.

The rise was attributed in the report to a rising interest rate curve, falling prices in the capital markets and an inability to collect variable management fees.

In addition, the company marked a 32% increase in gross earned premiums, benefit contributions and amounts received for investment contracts to NIS 9.8 billion.
