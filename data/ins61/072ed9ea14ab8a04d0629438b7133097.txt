How long will you keep selling India and when India does well as global recovery starts, at that time you want to come and buy in a hurry. You sold it unemotionally and you will buy it unemotionally. But my retailer is buying continuously. So when both of them want to buy, you will have a Diwali,' says Raamdeo Agrawal, Chairman & Co-Founder, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd
