Lizzo has always been outspoken about her struggles as a black woman in the American entertainment industry and has also never shied away from celebrating her body. In a new interview, the 34-year-old revealed that her skimpy ensembles on stage are a reflection of feminism and empowerment.
On being asked if such outfits add to the sexualisation of women, she told Vanity Fair, 'When it's sexual, it's mine'. 'When it's sexualised, someone is doing it to me or taking it from me. Black women are hypersexualised all the time and masculinised simultaneously.
