Gazprom said it would halt its natural-gas supply to Shell, which supplies Germany.

The suspension from June 1 is due to Shell's refusal to pay for supplies in rubles, Gazprom said.

On March 31, Russian President Putin demanded natural gas payments be made in rubles.

Russian energy-giant Gazprom is set to halt its natural-gas supply to Shell, which supplies fuel to Germany, Europe's largest economy.
