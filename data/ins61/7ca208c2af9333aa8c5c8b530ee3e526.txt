OK, well Netflix has gone and spectacularly stressed the crap out of me with its latest reality competition TV series trailer.Out of Japan, Run for the Money sees 29 celebrity players vying for a bunch of cash in a game with one rule: evade the hunters. Literally the participants just have to last until to the end without being caught by a group of people wearing masks and suits. The longer they stay in the game, the bigger the prize will be, but if they get caught, the prize money goes to zero and they're disqualified.
