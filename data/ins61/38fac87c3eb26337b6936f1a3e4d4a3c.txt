Dogs can be trained to detect coronavirus just as accurately as lab-based PCR tests, scientists have claimed.
In fact, our canine companions may even be better at identifying asymptomatic infected people than the tests.
A study that involved trained sniffer dogs and the sweat samples of 335 people. Of those 335 volunteers, 109 had been confirmed positive via PCR, including 31 who were asymptomatic.
The detection dogs were able to detect 97 per cent of the positive Covid cases, including all the asymptomatic cases.
