BISHOP, Calif. — Perhaps you've heard this piece of state lore: California is home to the tallest, largest and oldest trees in the world.

Well, it turns out to be true, with some qualification. The tallest tree of all is Hyperion, a coastal redwood in Humboldt County, exceeding the Statue of Liberty in height. General Sherman in Sequoia National Park is the biggest tree on the planet by volume. And Methuselah, a bristlecone pine in east-central California that is believed to be a stunning 4,855 years old, is generally considered the oldest living tree in the world.
