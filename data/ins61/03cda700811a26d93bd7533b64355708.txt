May 27—TROY — The Miami County commissioners agreed Thursday to ask voters in the county's unincorporated areas to approve electric and natural gas government aggregation programs in November.

The proposal includes all county townships except Newberry Twp., which already has an aggregation program.

County Administrator Charlotte Coffey said the proposal was made after talks with the County Commissioners Association of Ohio and its Ohio Service Corporation aggregation program.

Those organizations are working with more than two dozen counties on efforts to save money for eligible customers, Colley said.
