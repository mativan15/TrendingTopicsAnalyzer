Conservative MPs face a difficult but crucial decision. Now that her plan for growth has been put in the Treasury shredder, should they evict Liz Truss from Downing Street? One consideration in making that decision will be how the public view their Prime Minister after the last few weeks of financial turbulence.
The answer is relatively straightforward. Poll after poll has charted a nosedive in voters' evaluations of Ms Truss's performance in office.
When Ipsos asked in the second week of September whether they were satisfied with the way Ms Truss was approaching her new job, 29 per cent said that they were satisfied, while 27 per cent indicated they were dissatisfied, giving her a net satisfaction rating of +2.
