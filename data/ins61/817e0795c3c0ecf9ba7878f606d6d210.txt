Silvergate Capital (SI) is no longer on track to bring its own Stablecoin to market this year, though CEO Alan Lane said the company continues to work closely with regulators on the matter.

'We're certainly disappointed that it looks like we're gonna miss our goal of launching it this year,' Lane said on Silvergate's earnings conference call Tuesday. The company, Lane added, is working diligently to build its operational and regulatory compliance 'muscle' to ensure a smooth launch.

At the start of this 2022, Silvergate bought the technology and other assets from Diem – the stablecoin project from Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) that was first announced as Libra back in June 2019.
