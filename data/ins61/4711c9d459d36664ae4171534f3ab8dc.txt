It is the first morning after the last yow has lambed, and I am thinking that I don't need to slide out of bed at first light, when my phone lights up to say that I have an answerphone message. A neighbour has phoned to say that one of her fell ponies should have foaled during the night, and do I want to meet her at the bottom of the fell to go up and see?

It is a morning of all pervading dampness as I make my way to the fell. Mizzle is falling and having the effect of 'bouncing' everything around me into life.
