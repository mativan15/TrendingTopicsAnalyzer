Amaris Rodriguez and her mother participated in the inaugural South District Diversity Market last year.

They returned Saturday. Only this time, Rodriguez is a vendor with her own business while her mom served up tamales and more across the Pepperwood Plaza parking lot in Iowa City.

Rodriguez sells handcrafted cards and organic herbs. She is saving the money she makes at the market to buy a car.

Rodriguez said the market benefits the city, and she appreciates the space to set up her booth.

'There's so many people (here) from different places; they come from different backgrounds,' she said.
