The family of a 21-year-old man who was crushed to death at Travis Scott's ill-fated Astroworld concert has settled a lawsuit against the rapper, Live Nation and others involved in the tragedy.
Axel Acosta Avila, a computer science major at Western Washington University, died of compressive asphyxiation during a fatal crowd crush during the Scott's performance at NRG Park in Houston in Nov. 2021. 
He was among 10 people killed at the festival. 
In the wake of the incident, attorney Tony Buzzbee filed a $750 million lawsuit on behalf of Acosta Avila's family and 125 other victims seeking damages for loss of mental and physical health and loss of human life against a long list of defendants — including Scott, Drake, event organizers Live Nation, Apple, Epic Records and the Harris County Sports and Convention Corp.
