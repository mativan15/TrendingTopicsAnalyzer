The agreement is expected to help bring stability to the eastern Mediterranean. Gebran Bassil, who is under sanctions by the U.S., also told The Associated Press in an interview at his office that "it would be a crazy act" if caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati does not form a new government before the six-year term of President Michel Aoun ends Oct.
