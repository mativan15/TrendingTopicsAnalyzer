Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Sunday indicated that Yoga will be introduced in schools in the new academic year, extending a call made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to inculcate yoga practice from a young age. 'In the earlier days, there was a lot of stress and after Covid-19, there are new kinds of stress. In order for them to come out of this stress, enjoy and be happy in their childhood, Yoga is very important. We are making a curriculum and getting teachers for it and are likely to introduce it in high schools and colleges from the next academic year,' Bommai said.
