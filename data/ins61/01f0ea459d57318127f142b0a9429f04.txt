Jun. 4—Spokane Valley is prioritizing affordable housing, a new facility for a local food bank and sewer infrastructure for its $16 million in federal coronavirus relief funds.

"What we're trying to do here is put money out on a one-time basis that would benefit us, without incurring recurring expenses," Spokane Valley City Councilman Rod Higgins said.

The city got the money through the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill Congress passed in March 2021 to help the country recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
