Today, candidates are squaring off in more debates in marquee midterm races: in Georgia's gubernatorial race, Gov. Brian Kemp (R) vs. Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams; in Ohio's Senate race, Rep. Tim Ryan (D) vs. Republican J.D. Vance; and in Utah's Senate race, Sen. Mike Lee (R) vs. independent Evan McMullin.In Washington, the Biden administration is touting a new rule that makes hearing aids available over the counter, without a prescription, and often at a much lower price. The move coincides with a push by President Biden to convince voters that Democrats are working to counter the impact of inflation by lowering costs of living in other ways.
