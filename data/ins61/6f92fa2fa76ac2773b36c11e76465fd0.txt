The big story: Back in 2002, Florida voters established the state's current model for overseeing its public universities.

The arrangement, promoted by former governor and senator Bob Graham, involves an overarching Board of Governors that makes systemwide decisions after receiving input from local boards of trustees. The Legislature maintains some financial controls.

Graham pushed for the idea after Jeb Bush reorganized the structure to do away with the single Board of Regents and establish boards of trustees at each campus.
