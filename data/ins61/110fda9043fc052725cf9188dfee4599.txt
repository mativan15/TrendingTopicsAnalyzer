The early entry withdrawal deadline passed on Wednesday as several of the top prospects ultimately opted against the NBA draft in order to return to their respective schools.
The pre-draft process serves as a tremendous opportunity for underclassmen to get their foot in the door with teams and gain valuable feedback on how they can better improve their games. Several players in recent memory have used the process to their advantage and came back the following year even better.
Teams now know which underclassmen will stay in the draft and who will play at least one more season in college.
