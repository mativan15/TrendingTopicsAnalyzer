Florida football's season opener against the Utah Utes is still over three months away but that did not dissuade the Tipico Sportsbook from releasing its early odds for this coming season's opening games. Among those with betting lines set so far are the Gators, whose September 3 opponent poses quite a challenge to open not just the schedule, but the Billy Napier era.
Florida will be playing at home against the projected top-25 visitors while sitting outside of the rankings to start the season. Despite Utah's superior status among the poll voters currently, the Gators are expected to keep things very close that night in the Swamp.
