Earlier this month, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott voiced his support for providing private school vouchers and charter school opportunities for students in Texas. The move would allow parents increased choice in where and how their children are educated. 
Abbott is not alone in advocating for increased parental empowerment: 32 states and the District of Columbia provide parents with school vouchers, educational savings plans and tax-credit scholarships. 
Unsurprisingly, the Democratic response to Abbott's move was as swift as it was condemning: 'Abbott is for defunding our public schools' tweeted Beto O'Rourke, who's challenging Abbott for governor of Texas.
