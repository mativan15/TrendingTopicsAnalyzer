Bitcoin (BTC) was roughly flat on Thursday as trading conditions remained choppy across the crypto market.

Technical indicators have been neutral throughout the past week as BTC traded at about $30,000. Meanwhile, some alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) are outperforming BTC, which could encourage some buyers to return from the sidelines.

Internet Computer's ICP token rallied by as much as 20% over the past 24 hours, while Cardano's ADA token was up by 4% over the same period.
