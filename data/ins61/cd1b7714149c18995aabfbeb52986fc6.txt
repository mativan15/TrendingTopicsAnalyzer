By Australian Associated Press Published: 02:00 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 02:00 EDT, 18 October 2022 Western Australian nurses have been offered a $3000 bonus and a pay bump as part of a proposed new industrial agreement. The deal also comes with a commitment from the government to introduce nurse-to-patient ratios over a three-year period. Such a commitment would be a historic reform and one sought by nurses for many years, Premier Mark McGowan said. "But that's obviously something that needs detailed work," he told reporters on Tuesday.
