With about a year and a half before the next mayoral election, Ofer Berkowitz, chairman of the Hitorerut faction in the city council, side-steps questions about his plans for the position. But Berkowitz, who heads the large, secular faction in the council, nevertheless is vocal in his criticism of Mayor Moshe Lion's policies.

Big budgets are flowing into the city coffers under Lion. The money is invested in improving the infrastructure in the east of the city and in developing the education system there, alongside increased construction in the west of the city.
