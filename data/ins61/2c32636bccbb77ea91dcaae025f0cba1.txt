It may seem like ancient history now, but cast your minds back through the mists of time, all the way to December 2019. For Labour, the party is over. Gone are Blyth Valley, Bolsover, even Sedgefield. This was hailed as a new era; the beginning of a decade of Tory rule. But now, barely three years after that election, the voting coalition that delivered that apparently unassailable result has imploded and it is Labour that is poised on the brink of victory.
Meanwhile, the Tories squabble over the leadership like a sack of hairless cats fighting over a comb; none of them knows what they'd do with it if they won, and the comb will probably prove useless anyway.
