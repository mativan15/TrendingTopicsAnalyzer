PTIUnion Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman The NCP on Sunday described as "absurd" Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's 'rupee not sliding, but dollar strengthening' remark, and said she must focus on her ministry instead of making efforts for the BJP's win in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) also said that safeguarding the country's economy was Sitharaman's foremost duty as the finance minister. During her ongoing visit to the USA, Sitharaman has said that the rupee has not weakened but it is the dollar that has strengthened, and defended the eight per cent slide in the value of Indian currency against the greenback this year.
