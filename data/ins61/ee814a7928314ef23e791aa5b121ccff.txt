What will happen?

Air Force football is currently 5-2, but those two losses are in league play and that means they have an uphill battle if they are going to compete for a conference championship.

ESPN's FPI gives the Falcons just a 13% chance to win the division and 8.9% chance to win the conference. What is interesting is that Air Force has the best percentage to win out with a 26.
