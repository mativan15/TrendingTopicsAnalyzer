The Alaska Department of Fish and Game canceled the Bering Sea snow crab fishing season this week for the first time ever after the species' population dropped by 90% in two years.

The fishery of the red king crab in Bristol Bay was also canceled for the second year in a row.

The population of the snow crab dropped by one billion in the span of two years, a decline of 90%. The cause of the precipitous drop is not yet certain, but Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) experts have some theories.
