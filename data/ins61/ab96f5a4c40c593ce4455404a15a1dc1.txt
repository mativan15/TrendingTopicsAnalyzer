The recent increase in the premium rates on third-party motor insurance is unlikely to fully offset the motor insurance segment's underwriting losses, Crisil Ratings said in a report. The premium rates for third-party motor insurance have been increased from June 1. Premiums for two-wheeler insurance have risen the most -- by 12-21 per cent -- across engine capacities. For private cars, the maximum increase is 6 per cent. "The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways' move to increase the premium on third-party motor insurance after two years is a step in the right direction, but unlikely to fully offset the segment's underwriting losses," the rating agency said in the report.
