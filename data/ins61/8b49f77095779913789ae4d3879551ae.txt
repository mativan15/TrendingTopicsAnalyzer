June 1 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index gave away early gains to trade lower on Wednesday after the Bank of Canada said it was prepared to hike interest rates aggressively to combat surging inflation.

At 10:16 a.m. ET (1416 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was down 40.41 points, or 0.19%, at 20,688.93.

The central bank raised its policy interest rate to 1.5% from 1.0%, its second consecutive 50-basis-point hike, and said it was prepared to act "more forcefully if needed" to bring inflation back to target.
