Thanks to the presence of Olympic and World Championship medallists, boxing was one of the most star-studded disciplines at the 36th National Games in Gandhinagar.
Worlds silver medallist Amit Panghal, world champion Nikhat Zareen, and two-time World youth champion Nitu Ghanghas may have decided to skip the National Games, but Tokyo Olympic bronze medallist Lovlina Borgohain's last-minute entry after being ruled out due to a nose injury came as a big boost to the competition.
Lovlina made her competitive debut in 75kg and used the platform, like several other pugilists, as a preparatory stage for the Asian Championships in Amman.
