Two-day music event Lost Art Summer in the Square is being held in Whanganui this weekend. Featuring multiple artists, the event is split over two days, with an R18 dance party on Saturday night and a whānau-friendly event on Sunday. 'We've had people tell us in the past that they want to party but children were present, or they wanted their children to be able to experience a music event, so we split the event in two,' said event director Gioia Damosso. The first of three mini-festivals held in Majestic Square, the event will cater for a diverse audience providing a range of drum and bass, soul, rap and reggae music.
