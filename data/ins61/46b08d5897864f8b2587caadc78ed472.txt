The UK civil service has paused its flagship graduate scheme for at least a year in order to reduce its number of staff.The scheme, known as the civil service fast stream, will not run in 2023 as it has in previous years.The decision was made at a Cabinet Office board meeting on 19 May, chaired by Stephen Barclay, the prime minister's chief of staff.The move comes after the government said it wanted to cut 91,000 civil service roles in order to save money.The civil service fast stream is made up of 15 individual schemes, and graduates with a minimum degree result of 2:2 are able to apply.
