Diebold Nixdorf Inc. has agreed with its bank lenders and noteholders to refinance the company's near-term debt while providing it with $400 million in new capital.

Assuming the target minimum threshold of 95% lender participation is met, as stipulated in the agreement, about $2.4 billion of debt would be refinanced, said Mike Jacobsen, senior director of corporate communications for Diebold Nixdorf, in an email.

The refinancing is expected to close by the end of the year, according to a company statement.
