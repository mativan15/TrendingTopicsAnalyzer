I've been delivering Toronto Star Santa Claus fund parcels with my family for years, one link in a volunteer chain thousands long stretching back more than a century. We're good at it, my elves (Kelly, Jack and Riley and the late Toby Ranger) and I. We often do the hard deliveries, presents that have already been returned because the family was not home.
