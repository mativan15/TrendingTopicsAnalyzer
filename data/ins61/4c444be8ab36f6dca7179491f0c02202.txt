Oh how I miss the gags of Philip Hammond. Dry old spreadsheet Phil, who amidst the turgidness of that Theresa May government offered up a series of dad jokes while presenting his budgets.My favourite was when having just been appointed chancellor in 2016 he stood up and said: ‘This is my first autumn statement as chancellor. After careful consideration, and detailed discussion with the prime minister, I have decided it will also be my last.'‘I am abolishing the autumn statement.'That's droll for a government minister, particularly one who is actually also making a serious point, warning MPs that there was no need to overhaul the tax system twice a year.
