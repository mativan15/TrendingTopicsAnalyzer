In the midst of a worsening environmental disaster, protests matter more than ever.Last week, two Just Stop Oil activists threw tomato soup at Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers painting in London as part of a broader push for the cessation of new fossil fuel projects – something the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change describes as crucial to prevent climate disaster.The Sunflowers painting, safe behind a perspex sheet, remained entirely unharmed and went back on display the same day.The stunt followed other art protests, in which activists glued themselves to artworks by Botticelli, Boccioni, Van Gogh and other old masters.
