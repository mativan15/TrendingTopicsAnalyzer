Morsa Images/DigitalVision via Getty Images A Quick Take On Akoya Biosciences Akoya Biosciences (NASDAQ:AKYA) went public in April 2021, raising gross proceeds of nearly $132 million in an IPO that was priced at $20.00 per share. The firm provides single-cell imaging solutions for drug discovery and clinical research purposes. As long as the cost of capital is rising and the firm continues to produce yawning operating losses, I see little upside catalyst to the stock, despite management's revenue growth optimism.
