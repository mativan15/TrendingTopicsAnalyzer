"We do sometimes track our success against Ethereum in terms of developer adoption," Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko acknowledged on the Decrypt gm podcast. "I think it's really important because they are the market leader."

Still, he said it has been interesting to see what kind of developers choose Ethereum over Solana, pushing back against the idea that Solana is an "Ethereum killer."

"What's funny to me is that people call Solana an Ethereum killer, but we're so different," he said, adding that the two proof-of-stake blockchains are "almost complementary" in many ways.
