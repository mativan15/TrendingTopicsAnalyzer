Paul says yobs victimise him (Image: Samuel Port)A "poverty stricken" retired soldier has slammed his local council for housing him in a flat "not fit to live in". He also claims he is being terrorised by local yobs who have shot at his window and smeared faeces all over his front door.Speaking to LeedsLive, Paul Sheard, 67, says his council flat in Seacroft is 'derelict' and mouldy. He's been living there since 2009 and claims the council has not kept promises to improve the building. As a 'vulnerable' elderly man, the ex-army officer thinks he ought to be better looked after.
