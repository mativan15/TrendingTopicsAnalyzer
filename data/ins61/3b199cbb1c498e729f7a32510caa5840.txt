Luke Shaw has claimed the Manchester United team was not always picked on merit under Erik ten Hag's predecessors and that the new manager's approach keeps 'everyone on their toes'.The England left-back lost his place to Tyrell Malacia after United's 4-0 drubbing at Brentford in August but has returned to the starting lineup for the past two Premier League games against Newcastle and Everton. Shaw admits he has no issue with being dropped over a loss of form but believes that fair standard of selection has not always been applied.
