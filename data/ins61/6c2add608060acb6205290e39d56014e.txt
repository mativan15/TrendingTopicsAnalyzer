In 2020, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana was the top recipient of money from members of the 'gun rights' industry. According to Open Secrets, his campaign received a total of $142,653 for the 2019-2020 cycle. That put the so-called gun lobby at 33 on the list, far behind other industries like real estate and accounting. Health professionals alone gave roughly seven times more money to Scalise ($1,072,904) than the gun lobby. Meanwhile, individuals who simply put down 'retired' instead of any industry at all, gave 100 times more, just shy of $14 million.
