WhatsApp is reportedly testing a new feature that will allow users to edit their texts even after sending the message. WhatsApp is likely to bring a new dedicated edit button for texts soon. The messaging app is testing the feature on the beta version of the app. Currently, it does not have a dedicated edit option and hence, once the text is sent it can only be deleted, not edited. However, once the new feature is rolled out, users would be able to edit texts even after sending them. The feature has been spotted by the WhatsApp development tracker Wabetainfo.
