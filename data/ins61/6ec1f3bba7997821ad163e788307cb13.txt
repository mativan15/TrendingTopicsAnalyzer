This year's market pullback has created buying opportunities in the beaten-down software industry, and Goldman Sachs said some companies with strong long-term fundamentals could see a big rebound. High-growth software stocks have been hit hard this year as the Federal Reserve embarked on its aggressive tightening cycle . Goldman's software universe has suffered a 40% sell-off this year as investors rotated out of high-multiple growth names, compared to the Nasdaq Composite's roughly 23% loss. The decline has now pushed software's valuations to attractive levels, according to Goldman.
