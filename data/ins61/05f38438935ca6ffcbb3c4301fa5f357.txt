jetcityimage Talk about a crash and burn. E-commerce used car provider Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) gets downgraded following its share decline of more than 90%. And if that wasn't enough, Ally Financial's (ALLY) earnings provided an added blow. With approximately 60% of its assets concentrated in the auto market, Ally Financial missed Q3 earnings and revenue targets. It cites a 200,000 fall in auto loan applications since Q2, a $337M decline in auto financing income, and a $1B decline in consumer auto originations, indicating that auto prices may continue to decline.
