PM ImagesAuthor's note: This article was released to CEF/ETF Income Laboratory members on October 14th. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) is one of the most popular ETFs in the market, tracking the benchmark U.S. equity index. The JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI) is smaller, but is rapidly gaining ground in dividend and retirement investment communities, due to its strong 11.0% dividend yield. Due to reader and editorial interest, I thought to do an article comparing these two funds, their strategies, holdings, dividends and performance.
