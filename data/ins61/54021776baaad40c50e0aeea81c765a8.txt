Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of former US President Donald Trump, was sentenced Friday (local time) to serve four months behind bars after defying a subpoena from the House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. The judge allowed Bannon to stay free pending appeal and also imposed a fine of US$6500 (about NZ$11,400) as part of the sentence. Bannon was convicted in July of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition and the other for refusing to provide documents.
