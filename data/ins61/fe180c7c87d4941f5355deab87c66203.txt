By Adriano Marchese Fire & Flower Holdings Corp. said Tuesday that it has raised 16 million Canadian dollars ($11.7 million) by way of a loan and subscription agreement with its partner, Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., to use toward its growth strategy. The Canadian cannabis company said that it will receive an C$11 million loan from a subsidiary of Couche-Tard and C$5 million from the sale of shares. "The company will prudently use this capital to continue to grow the business and build upon the recent success we have seen through improvements in our retail, wholesale and logistics, and digital business segments," Fire & Flower Chief Executive Officer Stephane Trudel said.
