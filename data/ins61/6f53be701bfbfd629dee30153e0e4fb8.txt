There have been leaks about the display specifications of the Google Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. The newly designed visors for the rear cameras were announced during Google I/O 2022 a couple of days ago. The Mountain View company did not reveal the front of the Pixel 7 phones, but has confirmed that the smartphones will use an upgraded Tensor SoC. However, 9to5Google has discovered some display details about the upcoming Pixel smartphone. Pixel 7 phones will probably have similar display configurations to last year's Pixel 6 devices.
