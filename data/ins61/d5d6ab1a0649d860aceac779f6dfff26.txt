NEW YORK — Melanie Van Orden is a volunteer with NYC ICE Watch, a mutual aid group working with the migrants flooding into the city. One night, late, she got a text: A group of migrants was wandering the city looking for a place to stay the night.

The six young men had arrived in New York a few days earlier, sleeping on the streets after being turned away from the 30th Street homeless intake shelter, Van Orden said. They met volunteers on Randall's Island.

'This was the third night and they didn't want to sleep on the street again,' Van Orden said.
