The Raiders will not have cornerback Nate Hobbs in the lineup when they return from their bye this week.

The team announced that Hobbs has been placed on injured reserve Monday. Hobbs broke bones in his hand during the team's Week Five loss to the Chiefs.

Hobbs has started all five games for the Raiders this season. He has 36 tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble after posting 74 tackles, a sack, an interception, and a forced fumble as a rookie last season.
