An industrialist from Rajkot, Naresh Patel, 56, who announced plans to take the plunge into politics in December 2021—but eventually didn't—remains an influential figure among Patidars. Belonging to the Leuva sub-sect, he is the chairman of the Shree Khodaldham Trust (SKT) that runs the Khodaldham temple in Kagvad village, around 60 km south of Rajkot, which is dedicated to the sect's patron deity, Goddess Khodiyar.
Gujarat Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Gopal Italia was the latest in a long line of political leaders to have visited this temple, soon after he was released from detention by Delhi Police last week.
