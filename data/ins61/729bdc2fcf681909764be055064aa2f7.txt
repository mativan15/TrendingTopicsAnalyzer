Motorists are being warned by an expert that E10 is less fuel efficient compared to E5. This comes as petrol and diesel prices have spiked up slightly. According to the latest RAC Fuel Watch, drivers will now have to pay 163.26p per litre of unleaded and a whopping 184.49p per litre of diesel on average.  While the price of petrol has risen marginally in the past few days, it is expected to stay the same for the time being. That, however, is not the case for the price of diesel, which is forecasted to rise even further.
