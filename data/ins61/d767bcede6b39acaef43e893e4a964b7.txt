Pensioners could face the 'double whammy' next April of a real terms cut to their state pension as well as the prospect of energy support being pared back, experts have warned.They could miss out on £8.50 per week or £442 per year in income if the state pension is increased in line with earnings next year instead of with inflation.The triple lock is normally used to calculate the increase in the state pension but it was suspended for a year last year and state pensions instead rose by 3.1%.The mechanism would guarantee that state pensions increase by September's inflation figure, wages or 2.
