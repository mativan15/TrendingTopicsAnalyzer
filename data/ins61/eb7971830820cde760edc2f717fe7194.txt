NEW YORK (AP) — Republican Rep. Chris Jacobs said Friday he will not run for another term in Congress amid backlash over his support for new gun control measures. Jacobs, who represents suburban Buffalo, N.Y., told reporters he has decided to retire instead of facing what he said would be 'an incredibly divisive election,' just days after voicing support for a federal assault weapons ban. 'The last thing we need is an incredibly negative, half-truth-filled media attack funded by millions of dollars of special interest money coming into our community around this issue of guns and gun violence and gun control,' he said, according to footage of his announcement.
