Miss Manners: I think it's wrong that the students' mascot was not mentioned

DEAR MISS MANNERS: There was recently an awards ceremony honoring athletes at a local high school. It is a 'merged' school, and it adopted the mascot of one of the previous schools while the other's was discarded.
Some of the athletes at the event were from the school whose mascot was sort of 'retired.' However, in the announcements, they were all mentioned under the same nickname. For example, 'These students are the pride of the Raccoons' — but some were actually Beavers (not the real names).
I feel it is a simple thing, and that both mascots should be mentioned.
