HOUSTON — You have seen this before.
The Yankees and Astros played a close game. Houston finished with more runs.
This two-step is especially true at this time of year and at Minute Maid Park. It is redundant. Rinse and repeat. The Yankees' Groundhog's Day is swathed in orange towels flapping and Lone Star flags waving. Take your choice — the Astros are doing enough to win or the Yankees are doing enough to lose. But the outcome has an inevitability about it.
That is why the Yankees season has come down to this — Gerrit Cole and Nestor Cortes.
