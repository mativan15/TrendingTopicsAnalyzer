Gilts and sterling rallied on Monday after Jeremy Hunt, the new UK chancellor, rushed forward plans to scrap most of his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng's controversial tax-cutting plans in an effort to mollify financial markets.The 30-year gilt yield tumbled by 0.31 percentage points to 4.47 per cent, reflecting higher prices and reversing part of a surge late on Friday after investors decided prime minister Liz Truss had not gone far enough by firing Kwarteng and ditching an £18bn corporation tax cut.
