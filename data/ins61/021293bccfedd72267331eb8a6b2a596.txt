AgenciesElection Commission (File Photo)The Election Commission has struck off 87 entities from its list of Registered Unrecognised Political Parties (RUPP) after they were found non-existent during physical verification, officials said on Thursday. The action followed a statement by the poll panel a few days back announcing action against more than 2,100 registered unrecognised political parties for flouting rules and election law, including those related to filing of monetary contributions, failing to update their address and names of office bearers.
