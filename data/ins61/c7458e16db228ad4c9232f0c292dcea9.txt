Although not in session until next week, a House panel is already working on gun reform legislation following recent mass shootings by 18-year-olds in New York and Texas resulting in the deaths of 31 people.The House Judiciary Committee began hearings on Thursday to advance legislation to raise the age limit for purchasing certain semi-automatic rifles from 18 to 21, a measure that in itself would have prevented the Uvalde and Buffalo gunmen from legally buying the AR-15 weapon used in the horrific crimes.
