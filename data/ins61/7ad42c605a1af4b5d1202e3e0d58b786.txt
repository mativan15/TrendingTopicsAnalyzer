Twitter shareholders are suing Elon Musk, accusing him of acting illegally in the way he has handled his takeover bid. They claim the billionaire has tried to bring down the platform's stock value because he wants to walk away from the deal or negotiate a much lower price.
Last month Musk offered to buy the company for $44bn but later put the deal on hold until the company provides more information about how many accounts on the platform are spambots.He has since said he thinks he should pay less if more than 5% of accounts turn out to be fake.
