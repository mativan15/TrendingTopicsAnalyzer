MIAMI GARDENS, FLA. – Why did the Vikings offense look so lousy for so long on Sunday in the Florida sun?

It wasn't the heat; it was the mediocrity.

Kirk Cousins looked tentative, and bashed himself after the game for failing to sustain drives.

Dalvin Cook looked helpless until late in the fourth quarter against the Dolphins' physical front.

Until the last play of the third quarter, the Vikings offense, playing against a slew of backups on the injury-depleted Dolphins defense, had managed zero plays of 25 or more yards.
