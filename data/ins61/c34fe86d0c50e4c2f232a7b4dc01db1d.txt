'Steel is a global cyclical and over there the pricing power has emerged because the largest exporter decided to decarbonise and this is a structural change. China is not going to come back to exporting 120 million tons of steel that it used to do and there is just not enough capacity to meet up for that lost supply. The steel industry's changes are more structural in nature and should keep on playing itself out,' says Pinakin Parekh, ED-Metals & Mining, Oil & Gas, Cement, JP Morgan. 
Is the golden period for steel over? I had started saying steel is the new gold; but now I am realising that gold is gold and steel is steel?Right now, we are seeing a mini downcycle.
