(Bloomberg) -- Liz Truss resigned as UK prime minister after a brief and chaotic tenure that saw her announce a massive package of unfunded tax cuts before unwinding most of it in the face of a market rout.Truss, 47, quit after just 44 days in office, becoming the shortest-ruling prime minister in British history. She came to power in early September promising an all-out push for growth, but her program proved unpalatable to financial markets as both the pound and gilts tanked amid concerns about how she'd pay for her economic plans.
