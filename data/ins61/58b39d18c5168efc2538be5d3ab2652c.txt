A compact travel bag is hitting it big on social media, with buyers claiming it offers plenty of room – but is also small enough to fit under your seat, so you'll avoid any extra baggage charges. 
The bag in question, which can be found on Amazon, is called the Kono Cabin Bag.
It costs £17.99, comes in solid black or navy with black straps and – after some glowing reviews on TikTok – it seems it's well-worth the money.
After another TikToker posted about the bag, user franchescarosee decided to try it for herself.
