Europe's research ministers are to be asked for "up to €360m" (£313.5m) to start the process of reconfiguring the Rosalind Franklin Mars rover mission.

The UK-built robot missed its window to go to the Red Planet this year when the West suspended all scientific co-operation with Russia.

Engineers are now having to redesign the project to include only European and American components.

This shift in emphasis means the robot will not now launch until 2028.

Six years is a long time to wait, but European Space Agency (Esa) officials are convinced the scientific imperative behind the mission will still be compelling at the end of the decade.
