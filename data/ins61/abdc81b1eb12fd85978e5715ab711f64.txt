COLUMBIA, S.C. —

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina must testify before a special grand jury investigating whether then-President Trump and others illegally tried to influence the 2020 election in Georgia, a federal appeals court said Thursday.

The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals paves the way for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to bring Graham in for questioning. She wants to ask Graham about phone calls he made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in the weeks after the election.
