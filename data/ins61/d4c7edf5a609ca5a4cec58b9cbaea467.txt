House sellers achieved less than their asking price for the first time this year, in a sign that prospective homebuyers are getting cold feet in the face of more expensive mortgages and a potential fall in house prices.Over the past two weeks the average home sold for 99.9 per cent of its asking price, according to the estate agency Hamptons, down from the record highs of more than 101 per cent achieved this year.Achieved prices are expected to wind down further over the next few months as buyers either find it harder to borrow money or think it is going to be too expensive to do so.
