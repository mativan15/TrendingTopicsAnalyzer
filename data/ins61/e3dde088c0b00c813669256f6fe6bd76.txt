Bengaluru-headquartered Infosys is facing a lawsuit in the United States by a former employee who has alleged that the IT giant discriminated against job applicants based on their age, gender, nationality, and caregiver status.
Jill Prejean, a former Vice President for Talent Acquisition at Infosys, has alleged that she 'consistently heard from at least a dozen partners, to her shock, that they preferred not to hire additional consultants of Indian national origin, that they wanted women without children at home, and candidates not approaching 50'.
