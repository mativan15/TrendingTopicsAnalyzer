Reporting from Beijing — Everyone remembers China's 'Tank Man,' who stood with bags in his hands, blocking a line of tanks withdrawing from Tiananmen Square a day after the fatal June 4, 1989, military crackdown against pro-democracy protesters. Thirty years later, Fang Zheng wonders why the tanks stopped for that man, but rolled right over him as he and other students soberly retreated west along Changan Avenue after leaving Tiananmen Square in the early hours of that fateful day.He remembers his trouser leg getting trapped in the tank's caterpillar track and the feeling of being dragged along the ground before he managed to wrench himself free.
