FRACKING will restart in Britain to provide a much-needed energy boost after the government defeated a Labour motion to ban extraction.
Labour had looked to use a vote in Parliament tonight to force the introduction of a draft law to ban fracking.

But the motion was defeated by 326 votes to 230, with a majority of 96.
Jacob Rees-Mogg last month announced that the moratorium on shale gas extraction had been lifted following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
