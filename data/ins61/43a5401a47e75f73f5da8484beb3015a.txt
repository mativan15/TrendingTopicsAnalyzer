My daughter is completing a degree in politics and international relations, but doesn't know where to begin. One option is a career within the EU institutions. What would you advise?The good news is that there are a large number of opportunities for young people (and the not-so-young for that matter) to pursue rewarding careers in EU institutions such as the European Parliament or European Commission.At the moment, there is a push by the Government to get more Irish people working within the EU institutions.
