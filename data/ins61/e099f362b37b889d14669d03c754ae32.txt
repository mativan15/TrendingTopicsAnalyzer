New York Mets top prospect Francisco Alvarez underwent ankle surgery.

Although he was able to avoid a procedure and finish out the season by receiving an injection, Francisco Alvarez underwent surgery on Tuesday for a loose body in his right ankle, as the Mets announced.

Alvarez received further imaging, which led to the decision to undergo surgery to repair damaged cartilage as a result of a loose body.

While Alvarez will be sidelined for several weeks following this surgery, the Mets say he is expected to be ready for spring training.
