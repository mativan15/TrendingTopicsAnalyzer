Prince Harry, 37, announced in 2021 that he was penning an 'intimate and heartfelt memoir' about his life'. He said the account will be 'accurate and wholly truthful' in recounting the Duke's 'experiences, adventures, losses, and life lessons'.Penguin Random House has not confirmed precisely when the memoirs will be released to the public.Royal author and historian, Tessa Dunlop, told True Royal TV that Prince Harry is relying on his links to royalty, but is walking a 'tightrope' of just how much to reveal about the inner workings of the Royal Family.
