The No. 22 on the back of the jersey was the same, but the logo on the front wasn't.

After three-plus seasons with the Wild, Kevin Fiala showed up at Xcel Energy Center on Saturday with the Kings for a reunion that felt inevitable long before the winger was officially traded.

"I really enjoyed my time here," Fiala said, "so it's nice to be back."

In the Wild's most significant offseason move, the team sent Fiala to Los Angeles on June 29 for Gophers captain Brock Faber and a first-round draft pick they used to select Liam Ohgren.
