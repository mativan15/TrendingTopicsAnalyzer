YORKTOWN, NY — Yorktown High School sophomore Annabelle Newberger was looking for a project that would help people in the community. She found one: women who can't afford feminine hygiene products or "period poverty."The 15-year-old came up with the idea of a period products donation drive to supply shelters or food banks who have clients who are in need of such items. Newberger said at Yorktown High School a lot of students were involved in charitable activities."But I didn't see anything like period products," she told Patch.
