Insurance giant Travelers Companies' margins could be under pressure as inflation stays elevated, according to Goldman Sachs. Analyst Alex Scott downgraded Travelers Companies to sell from neutral following a recent analysis into life, and property and casualty insurance companies amid rising inflation. "We are downgrading TRV to a Sell from Neutral driven mainly by our scenario analysis in the report that suggests to us that TRV has less upside to further margin improvement and that we could actually begin to see margins deteriorate as the property and physical damage severity trends have an impact," Scott wrote.
