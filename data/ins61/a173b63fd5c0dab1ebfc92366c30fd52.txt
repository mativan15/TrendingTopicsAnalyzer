Antonio Conte describes Manchester United as a 'powerful monster'. Nevertheless, the Tottenham manager feels his team have precisely the weapons needed to slay the giant beast in its Theatre of Dreams.'Manchester United always have the power,' Conte said. 'Even in the last 10 years, every season, they had the power to go into the transfer market and to invest big, big money.'Two years ago, when they finished second, they went into the transfer market to sign Cristiano Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho and Rafa Varane from Real Madrid.
