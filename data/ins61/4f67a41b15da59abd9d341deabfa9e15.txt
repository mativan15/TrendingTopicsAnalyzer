BernardaSv Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a very high-quality company with growth tailwinds that seems poised for compelling total returns in the long run from the current level. And yet, famous short seller Hedgeye recently recommended Microsoft as a compelling short idea. I do not believe that MSFT is a great short pick at current valuations, as I will lay out in this article, and I do believe that shorting Microsoft could be a money-losing idea. Both from a valuation perspective and from a business-quality perspective, there are way better short ideas available for those that are interested in shorting individual stocks.
