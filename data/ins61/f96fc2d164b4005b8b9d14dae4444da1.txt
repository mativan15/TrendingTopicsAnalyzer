Onstage, the EGOT-winner performed Paul Simon's 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' and Stevie Wonder's 'Ribbon in the Sky' as well as his own hits like 'Used to Love U,' 'All of Me,' and the Oscar-winning Selma ballad 'Glory,' and he shared anecdotes about his marriage to Chrissy Teigen, fatherhood, and his pre-fame youth — about his conservative homeschooled upbringing, his mother's decade-long descent into drug addiction, and how his early career ascendance coincided with that of his onetime friend and mentor, Kanye West.
