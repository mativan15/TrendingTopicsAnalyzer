The coroner extended her sympathies to Alex's parents, John and Narelle, who spoke of him as a 'ray of sunshine' remembered for his intelligence, kindness and infectious laugh.She found shortcomings in Alex's care at Broken Hill, including the failure to take vital signs observations at the emergency department.The inquest heard the decision not to do so was a result of a hospital ‘business rule' introduced to help it triage patients more efficiently.The business rule did not comply with NSW Health policy, was 'potentially dangerous', and should not have been introduced, Ryan said.
