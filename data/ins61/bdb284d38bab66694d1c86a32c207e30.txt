Forma, parent company of Morphe, r.e.m. Beauty, and Jaclyn Cosmetics, is mulling options, including Chapter 11. People familiar with the process told WWD that such a move is under consideration, but stressed that nothing is certain and that other options are on the table, including out of court agreements with creditors. Majority owner, private equity firm General Atlantic, acquired a 60 percent stake in Morphe in 2019, which was at the time a popular brand run by brother and sister Chris and Linda Tawil that grew in large part due to partnerships with influencers.
