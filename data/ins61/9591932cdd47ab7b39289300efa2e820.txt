With the new Anniversary Update of The Eternal Cylinder available today on Xbox, the unforgettable adventure part is obvious. But there's an underlying theme about family too. Your first family is the herd of Trebhum. Family is part of our history too. Founded by three brothers our studio is ACE Team = Andres, Carlos, Edmundo. Gaming was a part of our childhood. We were very into cooperative games as soon as that was obviously an option. I'd say we were very good about playing games together. Which I think was one of the things that worked so well later when we started working together; since we had this team mentality for gaming it worked very well for development, where we'd share tasks.
