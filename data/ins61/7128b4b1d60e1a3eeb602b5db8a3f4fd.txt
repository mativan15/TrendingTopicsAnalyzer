By Adriano Marchese Toronto-listed stocks were firmly higher Thursday in midday-trading, rebounding from the previous session's slight decline. All Canadian sectors were higher, with material, producer manufacturing and tech services leading the charge. TransAlta Renewables Inc. shares rose after it said it received a waiver from bondholders over events that may have caused a default after determining its New Brunswick turbines needed significant repairs. At midday, Canada's S&P/TSX Composite Index was up 1.
