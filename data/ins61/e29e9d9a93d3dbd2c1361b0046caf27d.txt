Jun. 2—WILLIMANTIC — According to U. S. Rep. Joseph Courtney, D- 2nd district, the $ 550 billion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which was approved by federal politicians from both major parties, was long-awaited.

"We showed that actually, as divided a country as we are in many ways, we were able to come together to do something big," Courtney said during a press event in Willimantic Wednesday.

The event was held at Willimantic Waste, the site of a multi-million bridge renovation project.
