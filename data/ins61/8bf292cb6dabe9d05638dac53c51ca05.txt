Politicians sometimes talk about breaking up companies, but it rarely happens. There are lots of reasons for this. Firstly, a lot of companies are really hard to break up. Sometimes this is just a natural fact about companies. But other times, break ups are made artificially harder. For example, Facebook (now Meta) deliberately made itself hard to break up as a defensive business strategy. Essentially, when political discourse about breaking up Big Tech started heating up, Facebook worked on integrating Messenger into Instagram and its other products.
