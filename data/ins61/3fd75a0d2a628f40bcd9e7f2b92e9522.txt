The Goa government has vowed to give clean and safe beaches to the tourists visiting the coastal state and also to the people of Goa so they can enjoy the environment and cherish the memories. However, it is facing the menace of tar balls, which are back on Goa's beaches deterring people from walking barefoot. Tar balls -- greasy blobs of thick weathered oil that wash ashore -- have started surfacing on the state's coastline. Tourism Minister Rohan Khaunte has said that he has informed the shipping ministry and the Pollution Control Board says they have taken measures.
