Upholding her trial court-granted permission to travel to Abu Dhabi for the IIFA Weekend & Awards, the Delhi High Court has asked actor Jacqueline Fernandez to submit an FDR of Rs 1 crore as well as surety of Rs 1 crore as a condition. Fernandez is being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case involving alleged conman Sukesh Chandrasekhar.
The trial court earlier had asked the actor to submit an FDR of Rs 50 lakhs and also provide a surety of Rs 50 lakhs. While disposing of a petition moved by ED against the trial court order, Justice Sudhir Kumar Jain said that trial court has imposed reasonable conditions on Fernandez to ensure her return, and the order does not call for any interference.
