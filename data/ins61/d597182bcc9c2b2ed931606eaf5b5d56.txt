A manufacturer with operations in Louisville has plans to relocate its offices after some changes in the company.

Vulcan, a provider of commercial cooking equipment, is planning to move its offices to Waterfront Plaza at 325 W. Main St. The Baltimore-based manufacturer currently runs its Louisville operations out of 2006 Northwestern Parkway in Portland.

John Grant, controller at Vulcan, said the main driver behind the move is a need for a different kind of space. The Portland facility is a warehouse that formerly held the company's manufacturing operation.
