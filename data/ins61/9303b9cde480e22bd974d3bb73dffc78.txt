Giorgia Meloni's efforts to form a government in Italy have been hit by a bitter row with Silvio Berlusconi after pictures of his personal notes emerged referring to her as "bossy and arrogant".

Ms Meloni is expected to become premier this week when she is asked by Italy's president to try to create a governing coalition with campaign allies Mr Berlusconi and the Right-wing leader of the League, Matteo Salvini.

Behind-the-scenes divvying up of ministries in what would be Italy's first hard-Right-led government since the end of World War II started after her Brothers of Italy party took 26 per cent of election ballots cast, more than those won by the forces of Mr Salvini and Mr Berlusconi combined.
