We're one fantasy and regular-season week in and everything is up in the air. The Sabres and Red Wings are young but may be ready to battle it out. No surprises with the Canes and Stars. And congrats to the one person who correctly predicted the Flyers would become a defensive juggernaut (Wednesday wasn't the best, but four goals in Florida isn't terrible) while the Wild would suddenly forget how to play D.

(Did I mention I traded for Marc-Andre Fleury right before the season? Because that happened and I'm totally not worried about it.
