After agreeing to terms for a new $2.1 billion stadium, the Tennessee Titans announced a community benefits platform, ONE Community, at a press conference Oct. 20.

In partnership with 16 local and regional organizations, the platform stands on three pillars: opportunity, neighborhoods and education. Each has its own roster of programs that have either already launched or will do so in the future, as multiple are dependent on stadium construction.

'The process we took was to listen first. … We want to have sustained impact,' Burke Nihill, president and CEO of the Titans, told the Business Journal.
