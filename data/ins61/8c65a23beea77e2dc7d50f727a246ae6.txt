The Ohio Chamber of Commerce is laying out its legislative agenda for the next decade, identifying six key ‘levers' it says present the best opportunities for boosting the state's economic competitiveness.

'We've seen some great economic wins lately with the Intel announcement and the Honda battery plant. And that's great reason for celebration. But we don't want to rest on our laurels,' Ohio Chamber CEO Steve Stivers said while unveiling The Blueprint for Ohio's Economic Future at a press conference at the Statehouse Tuesday.
