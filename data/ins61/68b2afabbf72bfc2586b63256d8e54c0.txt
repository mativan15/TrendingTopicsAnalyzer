hapabapa Lucid Motors' (NASDAQ:LCID) stock continues to slide, falling nearly 40% since late July and reaching lows not seen since before the SPAC combination, dipping below $12 per share briefly late last week. While shares are near these low prices, it raises the question: is Lucid's stock a buy? Given the EV startup's limited levels of deliveries and reduced production guidance, along with a higher valuation compared to peers and dilution potential, shares are still a bit risky and may not be a buy just yet at current prices as deliveries and revenues may continue to disappoint through Q4 and Q1 2023.
