Former President Trump on Sunday endorsed Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) in the New York gubernatorial race, calling the GOP candidate a 'winner' in a post on Truth Social.

'I have watched and known Congressman Lee Zeldin for many years,' Trump wrote. 'He is a great and brilliant lawyer who was a ‘must see' for others in Congress when they had a complex legal problem that was holding up legislation. '

Zeldin was among the House Republicans who voted against certifying the 2020 election affirming Joe Biden's win, which Trump continues to falsely claim was fraudulent.
