One of the reasons Iran's anti-government protests have persisted is the emergence of new inspirational figures every few days. The latest is Elnaz Rekabi, a sport climber who defied the Islamic Regime's strict dress code for women by competing in an international tournament in South Korea last week without wearing a head scarf.

Rekabi vanished from view after her performance and only emerged after apologizing on Instagram for baring her head. Reports suggest her statement was coerced by officials from the Iranian embassy in Seoul, who then hustled her into a flight back home.
