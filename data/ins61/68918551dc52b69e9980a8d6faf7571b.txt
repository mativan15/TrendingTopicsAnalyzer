It's among the most traded commodities in the world.

And it's gaining steam in the metro.

Espresso Tech owner Steve Latham believes local coffee has unlimited potential for growth. Latham and his wife, Teresa Bianchi, founded Espresso Tech 16 years ago and now service hundreds of clients from large corporations to small shops.

'There's still so much more room for growth because what we do has grown every year since we've been in business, with the exception of maybe one or two years,' Latham said.
