Gregory Shamus/Getty Images News Deutsche Bank doubled its price target on Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) on Friday, arguing that the drug retailer's Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) unit, Elixir, could be valued more than it previously thought. The remarks follow an agreement announced by Centene (CNC) in May to divest two of its PBM-related businesses Magellan Rx and specialty pharmacy PANTHERx for nearly $2.8B in total proceeds. 'This recent trade of PBM assets gave us the opportunity to reexamine whether there is an opportunity to potentially unlock value through the sale of the PBM,' the analyst George Hill wrote.
