Lord (Willie) Haughey has launched a scathing attack on Scottish Greens leader Patrick Harvie, warning that his influence in government is a danger to investment and democracy.The broadside comes a week after the entrepreneur and Labour peer blamed Harvie for his decision to shelve a £1 billion scheme to build 11,000 affordable homes in Scotland, after Holyrood imposed a rent freeze on private and social housing accommodation.The legislation was led by Harvie, who is minister for zero-carbon buildings, active travel and tenants' rights.
