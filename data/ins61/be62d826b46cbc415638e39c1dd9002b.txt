There is only one month left for NSW residents to spend their valuable Dine and Discover vouchers.The vouchers were issued in March as part of the state government's plan to incentivise spending and prop up the economy.All eligible NSW residents were issued three $25 vouchers to eat at participating restaurants, cafes, and pubs.Residents also received three $25 vouchers to spend on entertainment and recreation, including museums and galleries.As the state emerges from the Covid restrictions, it's the last chance to spend the vouchers before they expire on June 30.
