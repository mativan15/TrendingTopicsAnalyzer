By Ian Walker Glenveagh Properties PLC said Wednesday that it has sold the East Road site in the Dublin Docklands for 63 million euros ($67.6 million) in cash and now plans to start a EUR75 million share buyback program as part of its plan to return excess cash to shareholders. The Irish home builder said that it has now raised EUR210 million from Dublin Docklands in three separate deals. "Our continued strategy of accelerating the monetization of our urban portfolio provides strong visibility on reaching our target of EUR500 million land value by year end, while also allowing the business to improve capital efficiency through a further share buyback program commencing today," the company said.
