With a price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 8.2x Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) may be sending bullish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios greater than 14x and even P/E's higher than 27x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

Pfizer certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the P/E.
