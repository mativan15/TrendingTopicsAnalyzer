The U.S. stock market's deteriorated breadth means rallies may be short-lived, according to Charles Schwab's chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders.'Even in the most brutal of bear markets, you get sharp, counter-trend rallies,' Sonders said in a phone interview Thursday. In her view, the stock market's recent moves higher, like the one leading into Memorial Day Weekend, seem more like 'a typical bear-market rally than the start of something new and prosperous.'  Breadth has weakened 'considerably' this year for major stock-market benchmarks including the S&P 500, the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +2.
