Before there was Depp v. Heard, there was Locke v. Eastwood. In 1989, actor Sondra Locke sued Clint Eastwood, her romantic partner of about 13 years, for palimony, and the tabloids went wild. It was a celebrity bust up replete with accusations of abuse and wiretapping, all the more shocking because Locke and Eastwood had been seen as a golden couple, and had made six hit films together. Eastwood was 58 at the time of the lawsuit—the same age Johnny Depp is now; Locke, who died in 2018, was 44. She said she thought Eastwood had ended their relationship in a funk of bad feelings 'because he wasn't number one at the box office anymore, or because he was facing his mortality,' as biographer Patrick McGilligan put it.
