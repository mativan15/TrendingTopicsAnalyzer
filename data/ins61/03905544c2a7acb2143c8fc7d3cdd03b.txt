An alarmed Semyon Bagdasarov warned fellow guests on a state-run Russian TV show that Moscow needed to look again at the country's close ties with Ankara. The pundit's panic was caused by the recent test-firing of Turkey's latest ballistic missile codenamed Tayfun or Typhoon. The surface-to-surface guided missile has a range of up to 500km and was launched from Turkey's Black Sea coast within easy reach of Russia's bases in Crimea. Bagdasarov called for a rethink of Russo-Turkey ties in the wake of the launch, describing Ankara's actions as a "very dangerous trend!""We need to look differently at our alliance with Turkey," he told Russian TV.
