NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A Delaware judge halted the state's efforts to move of all of its 30,000 retired state employees off of their traditional Medicare supplemental plan and onto Medicare Advantage. The Court found that government officials provided inadequate and/or misleading information about the nature of Medicare Advantage, which provides materially worse benefits than traditional Medicare, and has been the subject of dozen of fraud lawsuits.
"We are relieved and thrilled that the Court halted this unwelcome change to our health insurance benefits," said Thomas Penoza, a plaintiff and retired Delaware employee.
