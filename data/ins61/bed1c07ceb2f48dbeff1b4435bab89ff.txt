The Marauders (16-4) will now face No. 26 Pentucket or No. 7 Arlington Catholic in a Round of 16 matchup on Tuesday. Gloucester's season ends at 14-7.'This was two really good teams, and to me it's a shame this matchup was in the Round of 32,' Dedham coach Mike Nosky said. 'What the best system is, I don't know. But, I do know damn well we're not the 23rd-best team in Division 3.'I don't think [Gloucester] was thrilled playing a 15-4 division champion in round one, coming off the season they had and conference they're in.
