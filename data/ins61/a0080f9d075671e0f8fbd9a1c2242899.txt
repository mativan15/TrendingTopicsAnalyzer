Prof Chris Howgego carefully cradles the medal minted for the coronation of the boy king Edward VI in 1547 as he mulls over the history of money from Babylon to bitcoin.'Everything depends on confidence,' says the keeper of the Heberden coin room at the Ashmolean museum in Oxford. 'Coins are just one form of money. Anything that can be used as payment is money.'Howgego cites Papua New Guinea as an example of what he means. Pearl shells were once used there as cash, which is why the word for shell – kina – is now the name of the national currency.
