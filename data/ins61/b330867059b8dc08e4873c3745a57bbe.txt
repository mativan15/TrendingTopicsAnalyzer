SAN FRANCISCO — Again, the Celtics were burned by their own ineptitude in a critical stretch, a team that has championship aspirations was psyched out by Draymond Green early, and then was so careless with the ball, offering the three-time champion Warriors countless opportunities to build on their lead.It was almost expected the Celtics would play a porous third quarter after fighting to stay close in the first half, but they even outdid themselves with how bad they were after halftime, transforming into a bunch of iso-ballers who didn't trust their teammates.
