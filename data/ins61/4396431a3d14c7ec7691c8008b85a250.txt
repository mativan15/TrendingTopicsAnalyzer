There's another business closely tied to airlines that really irritates people.

No one likes to fly any more, and there're plenty of valid reasons why.

The airline industry is currently suffering from a labor shortage, particularly when it comes to pilots. Many of them decided to take a buyout or retire early during the pandemic, and the industry has struggled to replace them.

They've also struggled to get enough engineers, flight attendants and desk workers, and the ones that are still around are starting to leave, because they're sick of getting yelled at for things that are not their fault.
