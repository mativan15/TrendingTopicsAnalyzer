The Green Bay Packers elevated receiver Juwann Winfree from the practice squad to the gameday roster for Week 6. The move was announced Saturday, making Winfree available for Matt LaFleur and the Packers for Sunday's showdown with the New York Jets.

The Packers need the extra depth at receiver, where rookie Christian Watson is dealing with a hamstring injury and is already ruled out for Sunday. Amari Rodgers has only played five snaps from scrimmage, and rookie Samori Toure hasn't been active in any of the five games to start his NFL career.
