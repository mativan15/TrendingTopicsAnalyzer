Jacob (played by Joe-Warren Plant) hasn't had a storyline of his own in ages on Emmerdale, with the young man getting his head down and staying out of the drama on Emmerdale. This is unlike his mother, Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi), who has developed a drug problem in recent weeks and as it gets progressively worse, it seems more of her loved ones could be put in danger. With the announcement of a new character being introduced on the ITV soap next week, this could be the moment she puts her son directly in the firing line.
