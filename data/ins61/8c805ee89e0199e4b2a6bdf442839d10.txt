King Charles III is thanking the public for their condolences as he continues to mourn the loss of his mother.

Queen Elizabeth II, Britain's longest-reigning monarch, passed away on Sept. 8 at Scotland's Balmoral Castle. She was 96.

The new king shared a heartfelt childhood photo of himself and the late queen in letters he sent out to supporters, thanking them for their sympathies. One recipient took to Twitter on Wednesday and tweeted a photo of the card, which was stamped with the new monarch's cipher.
