(RTTNews) - Amazon announced plans to shut down its Kindle e-book store in China next year, thus becoming the latest US company to scale back operations in the Asian country. The company has stopped supplying Kindle e-readers to local retailers, and plans to close its digital bookstore in the country on June 30th, 2023. Chinese users will be able to download previously purchased e-books until June 30, 2024, and continue to read them after that, Amazon said. Meanwhile, Amazon will still provide warranty service and other help for Kindle e-readers, and will accept returns for "non-quality issues" for any device bought after January 1st, 2022.
