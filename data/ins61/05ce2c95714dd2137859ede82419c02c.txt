The Rose has thorns.
Democratic congressional candidate Max Rose came out swinging this week — at Hunter Biden — torching the first son for his shady foreign business dealings that Republicans say potentially put US national security at risk.
'There is no doubt in my mind that what Hunter Biden did was wrong, being on the [Ukrainian energy company] Burisma board and engaging in whatever else he dealt with,' Rose told The Post during a newsroom interview.
The former Army officer said the The Post — which first and accurately reported on the existence of Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop in October 2020 — got a 'raw deal' from social media companies who repudiated the story without merit, called it Russian propaganda and censored the paper.
