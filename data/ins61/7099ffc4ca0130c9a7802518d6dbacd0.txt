It wasn't long ago that Wayfair (W 13.76%) stock was a favorite on Wall Street. The e-commerce giant, which specializes in home decor and furnishings, posted soaring growth through the early phases of the pandemic. Those gains combined with a cost-cutting effort put the company on a seemingly unstoppable path toward ever-expanding earnings.
But times change. Wayfair stock is down about 83% since the start of the year in fact. Sure, a downturn in the wider market is a major factor in that decline.
