For the first time, longtime Torontonian Andrew Usher is considering buying a home. The reason? He moved to Montreal.In March 2021, Usher uprooted his decade-long life in Toronto's west end to pursue a degree at Concordia University while continuing to work full-time remotely at his Toronto IT job.Noticing condo prices were drastically lower in his new city, Usher decided to house hunt and is now preapproved for a $450,000 mortgage, which can buy him a one- or two-bedroom apartment. 'I don't think these prices exist in Toronto,' he said.
