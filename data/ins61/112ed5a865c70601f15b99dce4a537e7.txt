An alleged Pizza Hut server appeared to take repeated slurps directly from a buffet ladle in a video that has the internet squirming.A 2009 Clemson University study on "double-dipping" backed enforcers of a single-dip policy, finding that biting a cracker or chip before dipping it again significantly increased bacteria in the dip. Researchers said the bacterial count varied depending on the dip, with salsa absorbing more bacteria than chocolate or cheese.The COVID-19 pandemic produced a lasting impact on restaurants, many of which shut down buffet-style dining to curb the spread of the virus.
