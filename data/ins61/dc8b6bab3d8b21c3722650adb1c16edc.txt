Published: 09:24 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 09:24 EDT, 18 October 2022 Downing Street has insisted Liz Truss will not back down on a key commitment to boost defence spending after the armed forces minister publicly threatened to quit if new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt ditches the pledge. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace would also be under pressure to following James Heappey in resigning if the Prime Minister's promise to spend 3% of national income on defence by 2030 was broken. Mr Heappey said he and Mr Wallace, who is tipped as a potential successor to Ms Truss in Downing Street, both believe the pledge 'must be delivered' and warned there is 'no prosperity without security'.
