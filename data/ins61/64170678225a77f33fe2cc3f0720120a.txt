Stakeholders believe the only way to save Ruapehu Alpine Lifts from suffocating under an avalanche of debt is to ask the Government to come to its rescue. Local iwi, shareholders, administrators, regional mayors and council representatives met on Monday to discuss the future of Ruapehu Alpine Lifts (RAL) after its board put the company into voluntary administration last week. Newly elected Ruapehu district mayor Weston Kirton said the situation was so serious that the only way out was to ask the Government for a bailout, while PwC voluntary administrator John Fisk said they wanted 'an audience with the key minister' as soon as possible.
