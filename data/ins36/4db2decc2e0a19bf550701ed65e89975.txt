India slipped six positions on Global Hunger Index 2022 to take 107th position out of 121 countries ranked. India has been ranked behind all south Asian countries except the war-torn Afghanistan. With a score of 29.1, the publishers of Global Hunger Index – European NGOs Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe– have labelled the level of hunger as 'serious.'GHI scores are based on the values of four component indicators – undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, child mortality. While undernourishment represents the share of the population with insufficient caloric intake, child stunting indicates the share of children under age five who have low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition.
