Elon Musk made global headlines a few weeks ago when he announced his attempt to purchase social media giant Twitter for a total sum of $44 billion.On April 25, the company's board of directors accepted Elon Musks's offer, which equals $54.20 per share, and a more than 30 percent premium to Twitter's April 1 closing stock price.This was the same price of his initial offer on April 14.Once the transaction is complete, and Musk is the sole owner of the company, Twitter will officially become a private entity.
