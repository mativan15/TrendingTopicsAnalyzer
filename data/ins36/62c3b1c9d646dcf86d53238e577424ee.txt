Adam Kay has shared the most perfect response to Jeremy Hunt after the new Chancellor of the Exchequer claimed he ‘couldn't finish' his bestselling book, This Is Going To Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor.
In an interview with The Times, Mr Hunt had claimed the book was the one he ‘couldn't finish', commenting that Kay had ‘crossed wires' about him never having experienced life on the frontline of the NHS while working as health secretary.
Mr Hunt had claimed he had in fact visited wards ‘pretty much every week' and his duties included ‘changing bed pans, washing beds and doing tea rounds in wards'.
