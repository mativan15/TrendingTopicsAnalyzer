A woman is second-guessing her choice to skip the opening of her little sister's restaurant.

She asked Reddit's 'Am I the A******? (AITA)' forum to weigh in. Her younger sister is opening her very first restaurant, and she promised to go — but it brought up a lot of past issues. Her sister frequently took advantage of her while offering little in return.

Things came to a head when her sister insisted that she borrow money for a deposit related to the opening. The Reddit poster refused to loan the money, as her sister had borrowed money before and was slow to pay it back.
