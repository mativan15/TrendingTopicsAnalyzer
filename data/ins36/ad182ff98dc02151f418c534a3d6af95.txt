NEW YORK – In the early going Tuesday afternoon, the Yankees pointed themselves toward Houston and never looked back.

Giancarlo Stanton's first-inning three-run homer was followed by a second inning shot by Aaron Judge, giving Nestor Cortes – starting on short rest – plenty of positive momentum.

And when Wandy Peralta sealed a 5-1 victory over the Cleveland Guardians, the celebration was on at Yankee Stadium.

Climbing their way back from a 2-1 deficit in games, the Yankees – behind Gerrit Cole - won Sunday's potential elimination Game 4 at Cleveland and handily won Game 5 in the Bronx.
