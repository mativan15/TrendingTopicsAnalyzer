SHELBY, N.C. (AP) — Michele Wilson relies on an extensive stock of medical items so she can give herself dialysis treatments each night.For three years, Michele Wilson has been looking for a new kidney. Wilson, 49, lives with Senior-Løken Syndrome, a rare combination of two specific conditions, one in her kidneys and one in her eyes. The condition causes cysts to develop on a person's kidneys, limiting their ability to remove toxins from their body. On a good day, the condition can leave Wilson feeling unwell.
