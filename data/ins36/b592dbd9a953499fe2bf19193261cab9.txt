Doughnuts are one of the most versatile hand-held treats you can have. And in Pensacola, they come in all different flavors, filled, frosted, covered with candies or sprinkles and big and small.

The first Friday of June is a day to come and celebrate these delectable baked goods. National Doughnut Day was first celebrated in 1938 as a fundraiser held by the Chicago Salvation Army to help people during the Great Depression.

It was a nod to the history of the Salvation Army's Donut Lassies, who were sent to France and lived in makeshift huts near the frontlines so soldiers could come and stock up on goods and doughnuts.
