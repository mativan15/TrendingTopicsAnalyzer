Oscar-winning director Ron Howard was honored with the Variety Legend and Groundbreaker Award as part of the Newport Beach Film Festival Honors, a star-studded celebration of artists who've made a 'significant impact' on entertainment this year.
Held at the Balboa Bay Resort in Newport Beach, Calif., on Oct. 16, Howard was joined onstage at the swanky brunch by fellow awardees Jonathan Majors, Patton Oswalt, Keke Palmer, Aubrey Plaza, Colson Baker, Anna Diop, Cooper Raiff and Aimee Carrero.
The event also feted Variety's 10 Actors to Watch honorees — Kerry Condon, Stephanie Hsu, Ximena Lamadrid, Christina Jackson, Thuso Mbedu, Zen McGrath, Amber Midthunder, Sam Nivola, Jeremy Pope and Joseph Quinn — who all gathered for a special conversation, where they dished on the ups and downs of the business so far and where they want to pivot their careers from here.
