Oskar Sundqvist – the self-described "smallest guy" on Detroit Red Wings' Sky Line, made his first goal of the season a thriller.

The Wings were without two regulars Monday when they faced the Los Angeles Kings at Little Caesars Arena, and spent much of the game playing from behind. Sundqvist used his 6-foot-3, 220-pound body to stuff the puck with 40.9 seconds to play in regulation. but the Kings prevailed in overtime, 5-4.

David Perron scored twice, the second time on a power play. Phillip Danault scored in OT.
