June 03, 2022 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time AUBURN HILLS, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sustainability is firmly anchored in Continental's corporate strategy as a key driver of innovation. The company's sustainability ambition comprises four focus areas: carbon neutrality along Continental's entire value chain, emission-free mobility and industry, a circular economy, and responsible value chains. Continental aims to fulfill its ambition by 2050 at the latest. Achieving carbon neutrality throughout the value chain as well as its other goals, however, are not Continental's responsibility alone.
