The Dyson Airwrap is one of the most sought-after beauty tools, often out-of-stock despite its $600 price tag. Now, a new generation of the Airwrap is available — and it comes with some major upgrades.
 

 Producing awe-inducing results without extreme heat (we tested it), the original Airwrap has proven that it's worth the investment — and became a viral success. With 2.2 billion views on TikTok, the hashtag #dysonairwap shows video after video of the beauty tool's magical hair-sucking ability (technically called the Coanda effect, which uses airflow technology to draw the hair to the tool) that leaves users with full, luscious curls.
