Many people in developing countries believe wealthier nations operate according to self interest over regard for the most vulnerable when it comes to such issues as the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. "The global economy is now a house on fire, yet we continue to use evacuation methods that rush some nations out to safety while leaving the rest of us behind to fend for ourselves in the burning building," Malawi's President Lazarus Chakwera said at the General Assembly.
