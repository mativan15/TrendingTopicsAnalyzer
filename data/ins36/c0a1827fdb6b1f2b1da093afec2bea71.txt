"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) cannot be achieved without China and the engagement of Chinese companies," said Sanda Ojiambo, assistant secretary-general and CEO of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) during her opening remarks at Wednesday's "China Town Hall", a part of UNGC's 2022 Leaders Summit.
