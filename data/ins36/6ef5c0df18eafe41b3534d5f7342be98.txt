'We haven't had classes since July (2022). Even before that, classes were pretty irregular and they did not teach us economics or optional (optional subject),' said Kirti Bedha, a beneficiary of the Jai Bhim Mukhyamantri Pratibha Vikas Yojana (JBMPVY) who is enrolled at Vajirao and Reddy Institute to prepare for the UPSC CSE examination.
Launched by the Delhi government's Department of Social Welfare in 2018, JBMPVY is aimed at providing free coaching to Delhi-based students from the SC, ST, OBC and EWS categories to prepare for entrance exams for professional courses (engineering, medical and CLAT) and competitive exams for jobs (civil services, banking, or railways).
