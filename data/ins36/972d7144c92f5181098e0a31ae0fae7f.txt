A hard truth is facing government officials around the world: They're going to have to put up with spyware infecting their phones because they need the technology too much to ban it.

Scores of government officials have had their phones hacked in recent years, including French President Emmanuel Macron, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, staffers for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the EU's justice commissioner and at least nine U.S. diplomats working on Uganda issues.

But many governments use the very spyware deployed against them — often Pegasus software from Israeli company NSO Group — to go after terrorists plotting attacks, pursue pedophiles using the internet to find victims or catch other criminals.
