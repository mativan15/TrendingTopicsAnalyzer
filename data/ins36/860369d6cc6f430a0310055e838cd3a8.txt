After much speculation, we finally have a date for when King Charles III will be crowned.
Following the sad passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles III is now the monarch.
After a meeting of the Accession Council (whose members include privy councillors, great officers of state, some senior civil servants, etc.) he officially took up the title of head of state at the start of September.
However, this is not the same as a coronation ceremony, during which the new monarch will be crowned on Saturday, May 6, 2023.
