Worsening economic data may force central banks to blink and take a less aggressive rate-rise stance, money markets are betting, having steadily dialed back expectations of where U.S. and British interest rates might peak.The equivalent of a half-point rate hike from the Federal Reserve has been priced out over the last three weeks, putting the peak in rates at 3% next June.That implies cumulative U.S. rate hikes of 210 basis points this cycle, versus 255 bps at the start of May, according to Fed Fund futures that reflect expectations of future interest rate moves.
