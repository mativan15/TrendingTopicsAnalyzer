According to a running tally compiled by UNESCO, the war in Ukraine had, by early this month, damaged thirty-seven historic buildings, thirteen museums, eighty-six religious sites, eighteen monuments, ten libraries, and thirty-seven other cultural buildings. What about dances? This is harder to calculate, because dance is essentially stored in bodies. When Oleksandr Shapoval, a longtime dancer for the National Opera of Ukraine, died in combat, in September, the Russians killed both the man and the dances he contained.
