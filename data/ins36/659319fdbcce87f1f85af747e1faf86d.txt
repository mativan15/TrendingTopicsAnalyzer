A Licking County judge paused legal proceedings in a Newark bomb case after he found the defendant couldn't be found guilty of charges filed in a bomb case due to legal definitions last week. The pause is pending an appeal of the decision.

Last week, Licking County Common Pleas Judge Thomas Marcelain found Kristopher R. Porter, 30, of Newark, not guilty of two counts of unlawful possession of a dangerous ordnance - illegal manufacturing or processing explosives, both second-degree felonies, during a Criminal Rule 12 hearing.
