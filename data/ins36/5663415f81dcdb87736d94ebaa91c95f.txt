Colorado will spend $68 million to underwrite fare-free promotions on transit systems, expand Bustang service and invest in more main street improvements under a bill signed into law Thursday by Gov. Jared Polis.
The Regional Transportation District in metro Denver is still working out plans for a likely monthlong pilot that would allow people to ride its buses and trains for free at the height of ozone season. It's targeting the month of August this year and again in 2023, with the bill providing state money to offset most of the agency's costs.
