Respawn just released the launch trailer for Apex Legends Season 15: Eclipse, which is set to go live on November 1. After introducing us to a calm, soft-spoken Catalyst--real name Tressa Smith--in Stories from the Outlands: Last Hope, her combative demeanor in today's Season 15 launch trailer is a bit of surprise--especially given the fact that it's aimed at another one of Apex's most laid-back characters: Seer (who is so well-loved that players became deeply upset when he was blamed for his homeworld's humanitarian crisis in a televised interview).
