The Pittsburgh Steelers signed wide receiver Josh Malone and re-signed running back Jason Huntley to the practice squad, the team announced on Tuesday.

Huntley is in his second stint on the Steelers' practice squad. He was originally signed on Sept. 2 and was released on Oct. 12 as the Steelers added an additional defensive back to their practice squad.

Huntley was a fifth-round pick in the 2020 NFL Draft out of New Mexico State. He started his career with the Lions, but was released before the first preseason game.
