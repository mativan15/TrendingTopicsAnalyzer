BEIJING — 
China's ruling Communist Party is holding its twice-a-decade national congress starting Sunday, at which Xi Jinping is expected to receive a third five-year term as the uncontested head of the party, government and military of the world's second-largest economy.
The proceedings surrounding the event are shrouded in secrecy, as is typical in China's authoritarian one-party state. But the weeklong congress, the 20th in its more than 100-year history, is expected to produce a new set of leaders hand-picked by Xi, who faces no term limits and has yet to indicate a successor after a decade in the top spot.
