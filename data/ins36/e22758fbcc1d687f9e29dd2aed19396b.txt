The UK network has announced the launch of two bundles which offer the PS5 or Nintendo Switch on a monthly payment plan. That means fans can take delivery of these top consoles for as little as £17 per month and only need to pay £10 when ordering.Along with the device arriving without a huge upfront fee, there are some added bonuses as these deals also include unlimited mobile gaming data and a Video Data Pass which will reduce the amount of internet access you munch through each month.
