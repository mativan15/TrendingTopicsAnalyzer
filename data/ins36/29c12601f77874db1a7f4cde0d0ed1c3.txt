Germany could be facing a €5bn (£4.3bn) hit after Russia rolled out retaliatory sanctions targeting the country's gas supplies.

Russia stopped supplying Gazprom Germania, a subsidiary of its state-owned energy giant, after Berlin placed the company under government control in May.

Since then the country's energy regulator has been forced to buy replacement gas on the market – estimated at around 10m cubic metres per day – to fulfil contracts with utility firms and regional suppliers.
