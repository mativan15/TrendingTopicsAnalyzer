Since the launch of Disney Plus in 2019, it has gained recognition as one of the best streaming services with high-quality content, especially when it comes to original content such as fan-favorite Marvel Universe and Star Wars spin-offs. It's also cheaper in comparison to Netflix, as the Disney Bundle is only priced at about $14 per month.However, one of its biggest downsides is it's only available in certain locations, including the United States and the United Kingdom. So, when you're traveling to geo-blocked regions it's most likely that you won't be able to access the site.
