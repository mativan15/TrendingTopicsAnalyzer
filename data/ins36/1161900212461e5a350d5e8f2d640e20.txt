Controversies around filmmaker Sajid Khan don't seem to rest. The Hamshakals director is currently locked inside the Bigg Boss 16 house and is unaware of the emerging outrage against him outside the house. After multiple celebrities like Sona Mohapatra, Ali Fazal, Rani Chatterjee and Tanushree Datta called out his case, Sherlyn Chopra who had once accused him during 2018's #MeToo movement has filed a police complaint. ILNSherlyn, who was herself a part of Bigg Boss in season 3, filed a complaint against Sajid at the Juhu police station in Mumbai.
