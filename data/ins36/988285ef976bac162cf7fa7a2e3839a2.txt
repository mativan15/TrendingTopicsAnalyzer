What if, in a football match, there are 22 players running after a ball but there are no goalposts? Doesn't make sense, does it? It doesn't. But when it comes to investments, most of us make this mistake. Most people do random savings and invest without financial goals. As the saying goes, 'An investment without a goal is like a traveller without a destination.'

Money can be a tool to accomplish greater goals in your life, such as giving your child the best education, pursuing your hobbies, travelling to the destinations you've always wanted, buying your dream home, saving for your golden years… the list goes on.
