Publicly listed bitcoin-related funds have seen both their share prices and asset under management plummet, in line with the mayhem of digital assets. 'Investors have significantly reduced their exposure to risk assets and remain risk averse for the moment as inflation remains high and central banks continue tightening,' analysts at Kaiko wrote in a Monday report.  Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC, +2.69%, the world's largest bitcoin fund, has lost about 67% of its value year-to-date, underperforming bitcoin, which fell about 59% in the same stretch, according to FactSet data.
