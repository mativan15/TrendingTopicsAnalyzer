BEIJING, Oct. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- In Xi Jinping's report made at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), he dedicated a part to a long-standing strategy that is aimed at talent cultivation.
Titled "Invigorating China Through Science and Education," the strategy was unveiled in 1995 and has been enriched with the infusion of new insights contained in a series of policies rolled out since then.
"Education, science and technology, and human resources are the foundational and strategic pillars for building a modern socialist country in all respects," Xi said.
