The Supreme Court blocked enforcement of a Texas law banning online platforms from restricting users' posts based on their political views, representing a major win for social media companies.
Tech industry groups had said the statute would violate the companies' First Amendment rights and force them to carry 'the vilest speech imaginable — such as white supremacist manifestos, Nazi screeds, Russian-state propaganda, Holocaust denial, and terrorist-organization recruitment.' Texas officials, including Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, say the law is needed to stop companies like Twitter and Facebook from censoring conservative users.
