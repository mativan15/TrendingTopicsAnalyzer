Boris Johnson's sister Rachel has not held back from telling it how it is.
Appearing on tonight's Question Time, which was brought forward following Liz Truss' resignation as Prime Minister, Rachel was caught up in a discussion about whether or not there should be a general election.
While Minister of State for Climate Graham Stuart MP made it clear that his view was that a general election wouldn't solve this country's problems, Rachel was pretty brutal about the Tories.
‘The only thing that is actually uniting the Tory party is terror of a general election,' she began.
