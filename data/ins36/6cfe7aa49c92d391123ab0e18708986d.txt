European Union leaders have agreed a compromise deal to ban more than two-thirds of Russian oil following weeks of wrangling over a new sanctions package.Charles Michel, the European Council chief, said the deal would cut a 'huge source of financing for Russia's war machine' as the bloc ramps up economic pressure on Moscow.The ban will not affect imports delivered by pipeline and contains exemptions for Hungary – a landlocked country that relies heavily on crude piped from Russia.
