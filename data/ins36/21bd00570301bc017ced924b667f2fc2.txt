Shares of AT&T (T -1.44%) rose 12.9% in May, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, after the telecom giant announced it was raising prices on its older wireless plans for the first time in years.
The increase would see the monthly cost of individual plans rise by $6 per month while family plans would rise by $12 monthly. The price hikes do not affect AT&T's newest Unlimited plans.

So what
Although analysts worry that AT&T's increases could cost it customers who might switch to T-Mobile or Verizon as the industry has long competed by offering customers discounts, the carriers are not immune from rising costs in this inflationary period.
