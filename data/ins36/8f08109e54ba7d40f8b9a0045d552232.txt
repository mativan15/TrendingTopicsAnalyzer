The Rhode Island farmhouse that inspired the 2013 horror movie 'The Conjuring' occurred has been sold to a Boston developer who plans to keep it open to the public. The 18th-century home in Burrillville sold for $1.525 million on Thursday, far higher than the $1.2 million asking price. 'This purchase is personal for me,' buyer Jacqueline Nuñez, owner of WonderGroup LLC, told The Boston Globe. 'It's not a real estate development. It's around my own beliefs.' Nuñez and the couple who sold the home, Cory and Jennifer Heinzen, jointly announced the sale on Facebook.
