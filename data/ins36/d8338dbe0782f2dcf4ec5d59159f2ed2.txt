The pan-European Stoxx 600 index closed the month of May down 0.85%, as concerns about inflation resurfaced following red hot consumer price prints from across the euro zone. Euro zone inflation hit an annual 8.1% in May, exceeding expectations and marking a seventh consecutive record high. LONDON — European markets are set for a muted open on Wednesday after closing May in negative territory, as traders continue to assess new data on inflation and economic activity. Britain's FTSE 100 is seen around 6 points lower at 7,602, Germany's DAX is set to gain around 48 points to 14,436, and France's CAC 40 is expected to nudge around 7 points higher to 6,476.
