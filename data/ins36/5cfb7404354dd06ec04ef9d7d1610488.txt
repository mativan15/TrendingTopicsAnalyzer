After his anti-Semitic posts and tweets were removed from Instagram and Twitter, the hosts of 'Fox & Friends' rushed to the defense of Ye (formerly known as Kanye West), claiming that the rapper is a 'target of big tech because he's too dangerous and too outspoken and too much of a free thinker. ' In response, John Legend ridiculed the suggestion that Ye is a free thinker, tweeting, 'Weird how all these ‘free, independent thinkers' always land at the same old anti blackness and anti semitism.'

Legend is right.
