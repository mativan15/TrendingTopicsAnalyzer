The former Virginia Tech football player accused of beating a Tinder date to death after mistaking him for a woman was acquitted of second-degree murder Friday.
Isimemen Etute, 19, was found not guilty in the 2021 death of Jerry Smith, 40, after his lawyer argued he acted in self-defense.
A Christiansburg, Virginia, jury deliberated for three hours before handing down the verdict, according to The Roanoke Times.
Etute had said he visited Smith last April to engage in oral sex, after matching with someone named 'Angie' on Tinder.
