Lanvin Group, the fashion company majority owned by China's Fosun International Ltd., cut its valuation ahead of an expected public listing later this year, citing pressures such as currency depreciation and stock declines among peers.

Lanvin trimmed its equity value to $1 billion from a previous $1.25 billion in March. The adjustment in part reflects a decline in the value of the euro in recent months and lower trading multiples of listed global luxury companies, Joann Cheng, chairman and chief executive officer of Lanvin Group said in an interview.
