These days it's easy to simply buy an index fund, and your returns should (roughly) match the market. But investors can boost returns by picking market-beating companies to own shares in. For example, the Keros Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:KROS) share price is up 13% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market decline of around 26% (not including dividends). So that should have shareholders smiling. Note that businesses generally develop over the long term, so the returns over the last year might not reflect a long term trend.
