Jets country…let's ride.
Gang Green is as hot as they have been the past decade, winning three straight games and sitting in second place in the AFC East at 4-2. They are riding high into the Mile High this week against a banged-up Russell Wilson and the 2-4 Broncos. These are two teams headed in different directions. The Jets are looking to win their fourth straight game, while the Broncos offense is in shambles. 
To preview the game and talk everything going on in Jets land, we bring you a new episode of the 'Gang's All Here' podcast with Brian Costello and me.
