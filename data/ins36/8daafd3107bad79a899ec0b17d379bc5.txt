Inn from the Cold (IFTC), a local emergency shelter, told Global News that what it is seeing in the city right now is 'unprecedented.''Over the past year we've seen demand for our sheltering services double,' executive director Heather Morley said.'What we're seeing is families with more children. Right now we have 19 families in our shelter and 51 are children.
