VANCOUVER—British Columbia will get a new premier-designate Friday after a tumultuous NDP leadership race that ended with the disqualification of one of the two candidates.

In the wake of that abrupt conclusion, David Eby, the province's former attorney general, is set to become premier, replacing John Horgan.

Eby's only opponent in the leadership contest, Anjali Appadurai, was disqualified Wednesday night. As it was past the deadline for new candidates to enter the party contest, Eby will become leader, thus premier-designate, Friday morning.
