British Prime Minister Liz Truss on Tuesday battled to stabilise her position after an economic crash forced her into humiliating U-turns on tax reforms, putting her future as leader in doubt.

"It's hard to conceive of a more serious political and economic crisis in recent times than that which Britain now faces," right-wing broadsheet The Daily Telegraph wrote in an editorial.

The paper, which previously supported Truss, wrote that she faced "the ignominy" of becoming the country's second shortest-serving prime minister in history, unless her own MPs gave her "breathing space".
