European telecom gear makers Ericsson and Nokia said on Monday that they had won a multi-year 5G equipment supply deal from Reliance Jio Infocomm, India's largest wireless telecom operator by numbers. Jio chairman Akash Ambani said that the telco was working with both Ericsson and Nokia for its 5G network deployment in India on the standalone (SA) mode. Jio, Ericsson and Nokia did not share financial details of the deal.

Jio has for the first time brought in European vendors to supply equipment for its network as opposed to its 4G network where South Korea's Samsung was the sole technology provider.
