At the beginning of Malorie Blackman's engrossing and often shocking memoir, the former children's laureate asks: 'Why am I an author?' What she goes on to tell us certainly shows how she was able to succeed: absolute determination, powered by rejection and by the love and support of others.The memoir eschews a strictly chronological approach. There are five themes – Wonder, Loss, Anger, Perseverance, Representation and Love. The prose and occasional poem contain intimate, often painful and sometimes funny insights into the author's life.
