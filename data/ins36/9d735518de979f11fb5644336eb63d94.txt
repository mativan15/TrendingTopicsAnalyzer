We are excited to bring Transform 2022 back in-person July 19 and virtually July 20 - 28. Join AI and data leaders for insightful talks and exciting networking opportunities. Register today! We must address the significant burnout that is happening within the cybersecurity industry, particularly now, during Mental Health Awareness Month. There are currently 400,000 job openings requesting cybersecurity-related skills, meaning current teams are overworked and understaffed. In fact, 51% of cybersecurity professionals experience extreme stress or burnout in their current positions, which is no surprise when businesses suffered 50% more cyberattack attempts per week in 2021 alone.
