MUNCIE, Ind. − City council approved the 2023 city budget Wednesday that had been submitted by the Ridenour administration by a 7-2 vote. The budget has a spending increase to provide 2% raises to employees and somewhat cover the rising cost of fuel for city-owned vehicles.

Mayor Dan Ridenour said the submitted budget forecasts spending in the general fund at about $26.6 million, a less than $1 million increase over the 2022 general budget of about $25.9 million.

Prior to the meeting, the mayor said the increase in spending will provide for fuel increases that he concedes probably won't fully cover the hike in gasoline and diesel costs.
