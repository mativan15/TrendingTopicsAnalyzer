Mackenzie (Emily Weir) has been left content with the results of her latest poker night, but her debt troubles are far from over as John (Shane Withington) enters Salt flustered and tells her that the rent hasn't been paid in two months. Mackenzie is breezy and says it's an accounting error, but behind the scenes it's clear her finances are still bad.
What's more, the pressure is on for the poker nights to continue – with player Nathan (Ryan Panizza) doing his best to persuade her – but Mackenzie is determined to find other options.
