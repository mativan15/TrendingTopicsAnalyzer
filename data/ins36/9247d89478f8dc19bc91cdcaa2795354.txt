NEW YORK, June 2, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Oliver Wyman Forum, Oliver Wyman's research and leadership community, today published the third in a series of five white papers that, taken together, provide one of the most comprehensive analysis of the US financial markets ever developed. Oliver Wyman is a business of Marsh McLennan (NYSE: MMC).
"Overhauling the Science of Valuations" combines finance, accounting, analytics, economics, history, and sociology to re-imagine concepts of financial analysis that were developed half a century ago but that have stagnated ever since.
