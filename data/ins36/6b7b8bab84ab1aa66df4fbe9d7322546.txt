Automobili Pininfarina CEO Per Svantesson is serious about sustainability and the environment.

After many years working in the industry at Volvo and various parts suppliers, Svantesson left the business and started a couple of companies working on batteries and fuel cell technology. Svantesson wanted to be ahead of the curve when the EV transformation arrived, though he was uncertain of the timing back then.

Now, he's driving that change at the top of the auto industry, meaning the high-end, ultra-luxury segment with the Battista GT hypercar.
