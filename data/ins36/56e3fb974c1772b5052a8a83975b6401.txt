This is CNBC's live blog covering Asia-Pacific markets. Shares in the Asia-Pacific traded lower on Thursday as economic fears weigh. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell 2.7% after briefly dropping 3% in early trade, the lowest level since May 2009. The Hang Seng Tech index fell more than 4%. Kelvin Tay, regional chief investment officer at UBS, said the steep drop in Hong Kong markets is due to the Chinese government's "unprecedented silence on key economic indicators." "It's largely because of concerns over the economic outlook and a rise of Covid cases in the middle of the party congress in Beijing," he said.
