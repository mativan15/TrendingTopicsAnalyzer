gguy44/iStock via Getty Images Earnings of Peoples Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ:PEBO) will likely continue to surge this year mostly on the back of high-single-digit loan growth. Further, the rising interest-rate environment will play a pivotal role in boosting revenues. On the other hand, an increase in core operating expenses will limit the bottom-line growth. Overall, I'm expecting Peoples Bancorp to report earnings of $3.05 per share in 2022, up 41% year-over-year. Compared to my last report on Peoples Bancorp, I have reduced my earnings estimate because I have revised upwards the non-interest expense estimate.
