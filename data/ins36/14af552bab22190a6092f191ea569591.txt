El Cortez Hotel & Casino may be one of the oldest hotels in Las Vegas, but that doesn't mean the historic downtown property is showing its age.

The only standing casino on the National Register of Historic Places, El Cortez celebrated its 80th anniversary last November by completing $25 million in renovations. In addition to revamping its casino floor with brand new ceilings and bold new carpeting featuring a fiery leopard print and leaf design, the family-owned and -operated property remodeled 200 Tower Premium rooms and suites.
