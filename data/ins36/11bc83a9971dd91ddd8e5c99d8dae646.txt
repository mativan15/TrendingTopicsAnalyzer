Q.: I read one of your columns about investing overseas in which you wrote, '…past performance is actually a very poor criteria for picking funds.' What makes you say that? Every fund you look at will present to you in multiple places a disclaimer such as 'Historical performance is no guarantee of future returns' or 'Past performance is not predictive of future results.' It's easy to brush that warning off as a CYA requirement but it is nonetheless true. Past performance as a selection criterion makes intuitive sense.
