The Gujarat government on Monday filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court defending its decision to grant remission to the 11 convicts in the Bilkis Bano gang-rape case. Justifying the release of the convicts of the Bilkis Bano gang-rape case, the BJP-led Gujarat government told the top court that they were granted remission as they had completed 14 years in prison and during that time period their "behaviour was found to be good".
