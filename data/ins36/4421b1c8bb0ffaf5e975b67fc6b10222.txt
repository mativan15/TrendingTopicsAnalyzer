Nicole Aunapu Mann is enjoying all the beauty that comes with seeing the Earth from afar.
 
The astronaut, 45, who officially became the first Native American woman to fly into space earlier this month, spoke with the AP from the International Space Station (ISS) Wednesday about her mission and seeing the planet from a new perspective while in orbit.
 
Noting that "the emotions are absolutely overwhelming," Mann told the outlet, "It is an incredible scene of color, of clouds and land."
 
"And it's difficult not to stay in the cupola [lookout] all day and just see our planet Earth and how beautiful she is, and how delicate and fragile she is against the blackest of black that I've ever seen — space — in the background," she added.
