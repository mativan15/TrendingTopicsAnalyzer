Dear Editor
There is another way of dealing with "urgent same day appointments". It is not innovative; in fact it involves putting the clock back nearly 20 years, to the pre-QOF era.
It is very easy: people who are ill or worried attend their general practitioner (previously known as their family doctor) for an unbooked 'appointment' on the day that suits them. They don't mind waiting to be seen if they perceive their problem as urgent.
Availability of easy access means that some will defer attending, knowing their problem may improve, safe in the knowledge that they can be seen another day.
