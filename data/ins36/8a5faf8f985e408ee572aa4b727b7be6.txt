Netflix (NFLX 1.15%) announced to shareholders in April that the company had lost 200,000 subscribers in Q1 2022. The company's stock price plummeted by more than 35%, losing $54 billion in market cap in 24 hours. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has since described the event as "horrifying, disappointing, and embarrassing." 
Since then, the company has been reorganizing its priorities and looking at new avenues to increase revenue, including cracking down on password sharing and bolstering plans to unveil an ad-supported tier to its subscription offering, in response to increasingly fierce streaming competition.
