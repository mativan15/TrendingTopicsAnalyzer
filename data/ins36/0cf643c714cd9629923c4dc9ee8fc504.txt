After the US and UK requested Beijing to allow unfettered access to the northwest Chinese province at the UN security council, China rejected the accusations of human rights abuses being levied against the country in the Xinjiang province. "I wish to point out that the representatives of the United States and Britain in their statements made unfounded accusations against China, which China firmly rejects," Dai Bing, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, told the Security Council open debate on strengthening accountability and justice for serious violations of international law.
