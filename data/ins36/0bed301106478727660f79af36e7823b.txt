Published: 08:54 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 09:14 EDT, 21 October 2022 Oct 21 (Reuters) - Snap Inc shares sank nearly 30% in premarket trading on Friday, after the company's forecast of zero revenue growth pointed to more pain ahead for a social media sector heavily dependant on digital advertising. YouTube-parent Alphabet Inc, Facebook-parent Meta Platform Inc and Pinterest Inc fell between 2% and 7%. Twitter Inc slid 8%, also dragged by fears of security reviews of billionaire Elon Musk's takeover bid.
