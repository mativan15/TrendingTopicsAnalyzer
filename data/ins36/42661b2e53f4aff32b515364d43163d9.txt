AgenciesAmerican actor Selma Blair announced Monday night that she would not continue competing in this season of "Dancing with the Stars" due to health concerns. Blair, who disclosed her multiple sclerosis diagnosis for the first time in 2018, has performed well in the series over the previous five weeks. She stated, however, that her body "has taken a hit." Blair told her dancing partner Sasha Farber in a filmed segment that aired on Monday night that after undergoing MRI and other diagnoses, it has been found most unsuitable for her to continue in the competition.
