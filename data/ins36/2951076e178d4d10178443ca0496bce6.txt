NEW DELHI: Aditya Birla Group (ABG) chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said he is ‘absolutely committed' to stay invested in the ailing telecom operator Vodafone Idea. 'As of now, we are very committed. The intent is to find a financial partner to come and invest in the company,' Birla told BQ Prime in an interview, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, adding that the worst is behind for the telco. 'I think that's in the works [equity conversion]... most important thing to do now is to get funding for which discussions are happening with investors around the world… not the most easiest to happen because the company was in trouble as we know.
