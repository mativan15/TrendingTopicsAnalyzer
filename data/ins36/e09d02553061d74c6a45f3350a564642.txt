According to UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the North West Space Cluster will generate jobs, attract investment, support businesses and create skills. And at the launch event held at Jodrell Bank's Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) headquarters, Science Minister George Freeman added that the cluster would prove vital to the government's mission to double its share of the global space market by the year 2030 and 'level up the UK'. The new cluster will be led by the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), in tandem with a consortium of key regional, national and international partners.
