Fresh Market (TFM) Fresh Market is a chain of 159 mid-sized, fresh food-focused grocery stores, with perishables making up 71% of sales (versus 35% in traditional grocery stores). Its targeted consumer is similar to that of Whole Foods, owned by Amazon (AMZN). Fresh Market particularly benefitted from the sharp increase in in-home eating caused by the pandemic. Although customer traffic declined by 10% as consumers limited trips outside the home, average transaction size increased 25% and same-store sales rose 22%.
