E_Y_E Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock has risen 2.7% in Monday premarket trading as the company's Q3 earnings exceeded Wall Street estimates, helped by rising interest rates, strong consumer and global banking units and fairly stable global markets revenue. The bank increased its provision for bad debt as it built reserves in preparation for a weaker economy. In the company's Global Markets division, growth in fixed income, currencies and commodities sales and trading revenue helped to offset a decline in equities sales and trading revenue.
