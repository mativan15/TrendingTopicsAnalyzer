The Giants signed receiver Marcus Johnson to the 53-player roster off the practice squad, the team announced Tuesday. He was out of standard game-day elevations after being promoted for each of the past three games.

The Giants had two open roster spots after placing rookie defensive lineman D.J. Davidson and defensive back Tony Jefferson on injured reserve last week.

Johnson started each of the past two games, when he caught his season total of five passes for 60 yards.
