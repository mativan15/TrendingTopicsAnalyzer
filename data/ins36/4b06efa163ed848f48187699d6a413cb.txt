Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Thursday that people must wear masks and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour if they didn't want fresh restrictions, as the state is reporting an increase in the number of coronavirus infections. The chief minister gave the warning after he chaired a Covid Task force meeting.

In a statement issued after the meeting, Thackeray said in the last one-and-a-half month, Covid cases in the state had increased seven-fold. Additional chief secretary (health) Pradeep Vyas said Mumbai, Thane and Pune had around 97% of the state's cases.
