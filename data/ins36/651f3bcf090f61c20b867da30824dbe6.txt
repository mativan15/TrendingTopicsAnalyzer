Semafor, an online publication covering a range of topics from climate change to technology, launched today (Oct. 18). Created by former New York Times columnist and Buzzfeed editor Ben Smith and Bloomberg Media ex-CEO Justin Smith (who are not related), Semafor seeks to combat news bias and misinformation by sectioning out different viewpoints in its articles.

Of all times to start a publication, the present news economy isn't favorable. Inflation is at its highest 12-month point in decades. Publications are 'ferociously' competing for eyeballs and advertising dollars, said Craig Huber, media analyst at Huber Research Partners, a media research firm.
