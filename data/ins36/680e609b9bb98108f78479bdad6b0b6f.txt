The Enforcement Directorate has opposed Congress MP Karti Chidambaram's anticipatory bail plea, calling it 'premature', saying there were no grounds for the anticipatory bail plea to be permitted. ED's counsel told a special CBI court on Monday that the agency has just started a probe into a 'money laundering case' against him. Karti's counsel contended that the ED registered the case 'in haste' and 'without any evidence of money laundering'.

 Recording contentions of both parties, the special CBI court reserved its orders.
