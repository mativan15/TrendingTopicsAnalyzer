Kicking off this week's, Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo in Orlando this morning, Gartner analysts told the audience of senior IT executives that they should "use IT to drive sustainable growth," especially in uncertain economic times. In the keynote, the analysts focused on using IT to revolutionize work by using tech to enable the workforce to create sustainable outcomes; to responsibly invest to deliver both financial and sustainability outcomes; and implement resilient cybersecurity.

In the first category, Gartner VP and Distinguished Analyst Tino Nunno pushed the concept of "revolutionary work," noting the difficulty many firms have in hiring and retaining employees.
