President Putin will face 'severe consequences' if he unleashes nuclear weapons on Ukraine, Downing Street has warned, as the head of the armed forces said troops need to be prepared for war.Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, flew to Washington this week for talks with his US counterpart amid concerns that the Russian president could follow through on his threats to detonate a nuclear warhead.Some senior government figures believe that although Putin is unlikely to carry out a nuclear strike on land, he could use a nuclear weapon as a show of force by firing it into the Black Sea.
