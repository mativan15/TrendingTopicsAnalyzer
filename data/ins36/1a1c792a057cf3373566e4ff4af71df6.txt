How has the Eagles' secondary gone from worst to first? originally appeared on NBC Sports Philadelphia

This year's Eagles secondary and last year's Eagles secondary don't even play the same sport.

Remember all those quarterbacks who completed 80 percent of their passes against the Eagles last year? Remember all those quarterbacks who had career games playing against this secondary? Remember all the times teams would start chucking the ball up and down the field and the Eagles barely put up a fight?

Yeah, things have changed around here.
