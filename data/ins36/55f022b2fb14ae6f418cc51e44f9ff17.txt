As I walk to the neighbourhood cafe to get my cappuccino, the kerb-side is overflowing with household items: a massive TV, a rice cooker, a mattress and a bed frame, a few chairs, some kitchen utensils, and tables. I am in shock. I asked myself, 'Why would people throw perfectly fine items?'I am tempted to rescue each one. What shocks me even more is that several days later they all remain lying in the kerb-side as I walk to the cafe.Some of the items in hard rubbish can still be used.Credit:James Alcock.
