Reuters(Representative image)Buoyed by surplus rainfall this year, Nepal is exporting surplus electricity to India through its power exchange market for the second consecutive year, state-owned power utility body, the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) has said. In November 2021, the Energy Exchange under India's Power Ministry had granted permission to Nepal after lobbying from Kathmandu, as the NEA is now in a position to sell its surplus energy, according to a report in The Kathmandu Post newspaper.
