Investors should buy mega-cap tech stocks as valuations in the Nasdaq 100 fall to levels not seen since the depths of the dot-com bust, Fundstrat's Tom Lee said in a Friday note.That's a bold call considering that the Nasdaq has seen the bulk of this year's stock market sell-off, with the tech-heavy index falling nearly 30% at its lows. Rising interest rates and concerns of an economic recession have weighed on the valuations of companies that sport fast growth but little profits.But after the year-to-date decline, Lee now sees an attractive risk/reward profile in the Nasdaq 100 and its associated mega-cap tech stocks, according to the note.
