Small to medium office tenants are leading the charge in the leasing market and are now responsible for the bulk of the take-up in the sector.

This has led to a clear division emerging in the way small and large corporate occupiers are addressing their office requirements post-pandemic, new CBRE research has shown.

Financial consultant Lorica Partners has secured new office space in 68 Pitt Street, Sydney.

While the larger tenants are downsizing, such as Westpac vacating 16,000 square metres at 275 Kent

Street in Sydney, spaces of around 1000 square metres are being snapped up by a range of tenants from consultants to tech experts who prefer a smaller office to working from home.
