Boston Police issued a community alert Saturday warning parents of a kidnapping scam.

This alert comes after at least three parents of students who are enrolled in Boston public schools received phone calls from someone who tried to trick them into paying ransom by falsely claiming their children were in danger or had been kidnapped.

'The scammers had information about the parent's child, including their name, and demanded the parent send money through Western Union,' Boston police said in a statement.
