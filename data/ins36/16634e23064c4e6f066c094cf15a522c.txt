adventtr Overview Lilium N.V. (NASDAQ:LILM) is currently massively undervalued. LILM is a significant player in the electric vertical take-off and landing [eVTOL] business, which is expanding quickly. Due to the company's lack of current significant revenue or profit generation and the fact that it still has a lot to demonstrate to the market, I believe there is a huge valuation gap between LILM's current market price and its true worth (which translates to higher execution risk). I anticipate a favorable response from the market if the company can demonstrate that investors can put their faith in its management.
