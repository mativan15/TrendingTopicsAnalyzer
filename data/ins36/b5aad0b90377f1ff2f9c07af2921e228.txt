JHVEPhoto An expected dip in demand for home improvement products prompted Evercore to downgrade Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) stock on Wednesday. The firm moved from an 'Outperform' to an 'In-Line' rating on the name as 'slipping lead indicators' led the firm to lower EPS estimates into 2023. The firm's analysts indicated that despite faith in Lowe's (LOW) management and its ability to maintain margins amidst a more cost-intensive environment, overall macroeconomic headwinds hold back bullishness.
