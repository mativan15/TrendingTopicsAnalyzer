Millions of Americans are still eligible to receive a COVID-19 stimulus payment, with some households in store for a possibly massive payment.   More than 9 million mostly low-income Americans did not claim pieces of – or all of – the various relief payments delivered the pandemic, the IRS announced in a news release. Many are still qualified to receive the money even if they had no income last year; however, they will be required to file a tax return in order to take advantage of the relief payments, including the expanded child tax credit, the 2021 recovery rebate credit and the earned income tax credit.
