Crown Prince Haakon of Norway is speaking out on a "difficult" topic.
 
During an outing, the heir to Norway's throne was asked about the reports saying that discussions are going on about whether or not his sister, Princess Märtha Louise, will keep her royal title.
 
"This is a topic that I find difficult," Crown Prince Haakon said, according to Royal Central.
 
Märtha Louise, 51, got engaged to Shaman Durek — a Los Angeles-based "spiritual guide and gifted healer" whose celebrity fans include Gwyneth Paltrow, Nina Dobrev and James Van Der Beek — earlier this year.
