Six soldiers from the Irish Guards and a former Coldstream Guard have been arrested over a suspected cocaine racket, it was reported last night.
The troops, whose Colonel-in-Chief is the Duke of Cambridge, were arrested on suspicion of dealing class A drugs and money laundering offences.
According to The Sun, the soldiers were held for allegedly organising a loan shark operation in which they lent money at extortionate rates, collecting debts and laundering cash.
The individuals were reportedly arrested on Wednesday after raids carried out in Hampshire, Berkshire, North Wales and Northern Ireland.
