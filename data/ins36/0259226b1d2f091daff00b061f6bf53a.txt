Richard Madeley and Charlotte Hawkins discussed whether patients should have to pay a £10 fine if they miss their scheduled doctor's appointment. The Good Morning Britain hosts welcomed Professor Martin Marshall, who was opposed to the idea, and Dr Daniel Olaiya who believed it would be beneficial to fine patients. The discussion arose after it was reported the taxpayer has already dished out around £120 million to cover the costs of no-shows in 2022 so far.The debate certainly sparked a strong reaction online, and while many agreed with the idea, others were completely opposed to it.
