Hello world, and welcome to The Guardian's liveblog of the BBC's Platinum Party at the Palace. That's right, some people are singing on TV on a Saturday night, and thus The Guardian is legally mandated to liveblog it.

What is the BBC's Platinum Party at the Palace? Glad you asked. It's the pop culture centrepiece of the Queen's platinum jubilee; an hours-long miniature Live Aid that takes place in a palace and, as far as I am aware, exists to raise money for no good causes. Instead, we'll be treated to performances by Queen + Adam Lambert, Diana Ross, Nile Rodgers, Elbow, Duran Duran and, slightly bewilderingly, Hans Zimmer.
