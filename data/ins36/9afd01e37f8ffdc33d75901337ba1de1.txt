'If it's money I say he owes me, and he says I owe him, why isn't he being picked up for fraud for not paying me my commissions?' Day said. 'I don't understand.'Murphy said police had gone through a process where 'he's come to us and he's provided a statement to us saying he's owed this money, and then we've gone through the accounts'.Day said the dispute was 'before the court right now' and questioned, 'why are we not just dealing with it with the court?''If he thinks I didn't pay it to him, bring it up in the court - present your evidence, I'll present mine, it'll be resolved,' Day said.
