Retirement savers will be able to stash away significantly more money in their 401(k)s and IRAs next year, the IRS announced Friday. Due to the soaring cost of living, the inflation-adjusted employee contribution limit for 401(k)s will be $22,500 for 2023. That's an unprecedented increase of $2,000 from this year. Those with traditional or Roth IRAs can contribute up to $6,500, up from $6,000 this year. The news comes a few days after the IRS also announced the new tax brackets and standard deduction for 2023.
