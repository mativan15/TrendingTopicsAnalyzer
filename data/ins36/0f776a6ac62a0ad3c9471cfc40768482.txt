Four-star Gavin Griffiths put on a display over the weekend, showing why he is a coveted prospect and one of the best forwards in the class of 2023.
Griffiths is one of the top prospects on the Rutgers recruiting board – if not the top prospect. With a college decision potentially coming down the road sooner rather than later, Griffiths showed that is capable of being an elite player at the national level.
He showed great shooting range, athleticism, ball-handling, rebounding and defensive prowess over the weekend at the Nike EYBL event in Louisville.
