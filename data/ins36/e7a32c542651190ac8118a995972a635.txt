Interpol cannot grant observer status to Taiwan during its 90th General Assembly beginning on Tuesday, its Secretary General Jurgen Stock said.
Taiwan has demanded the observer status for its meaningful participation in Interpol so as to ensure that no gaps and loopholes exist in the global fight against cross-border crime.
In response to a question, Stock said, 'In 1984, the Interpol General Assembly recognised the People's Republic of China as the sole representation of China. As such Interpol recognises Taiwan is part of China and as China is a member of Interpol, Interpol cannot grant Taiwan observer status in General Assembly.
