Shared micromobility company Bird is exiting several markets across the world as it struggles to build an economically viable business, according to a regulatory filing.
Bird said it will 'fully exit Germany, Sweden and Norway, as well as wind down operations in 'several dozen additional, primarily small to mid-sized markets' across the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to the company. Bird would not respond to requests for more information from TechCrunch, so it's not clear which cities Bird will exit.
