THE Moon is slowly moving away from Earth, a shock new study has revealed.
It's currently shifting 3.8cm further from our planet each year - and has been doing for billions before that.
The distance between the Moon and Earth has been widening very slowly
Today, the Moon is 238,855 miles away, but it was once a lot closer.
Some 2.45billion years ago, it was just under 200,000 miles out.
The Moon also has a braking effect on Earth, meaning the further it goes the longer a day lasts.
So back 2.45billion years ago there were actually 16.
