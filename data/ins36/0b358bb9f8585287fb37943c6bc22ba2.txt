The SNP is preparing to fight a general election, the party's Westminster leader said, as he insisted Scots will be 'appalled' at the prospect of Boris Johnson making a dramatic comeback as prime minister.Ian Blackford said that 'given everything that happened' when Mr Johnson was in charge at Downing Street, it would be 'beyond the pale' for him to return.'It is almost beyond belief that the Conservatives would even consider this,' the SNP MP said.The coronavirus 'partygate' scandal saw Mr Johnson become the first prime minister to receive a criminal penalty while in office.
