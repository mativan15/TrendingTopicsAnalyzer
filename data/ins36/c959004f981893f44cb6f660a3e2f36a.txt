On Friday morning, a 5.0-magnitude earthquake shook Hawaii Island, inflicting modest property damage in certain locations and initiating a series of aftershocks that experts fear could last for days. According to the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, the largest quake occurred only 24 seconds after a 4.6-magnitude quake. Both were located south of Pahala, near the southeastern face of Mauna Loa, with the bigger one being 4.6 miles deep. The severe tremors were felt by hundreds of individuals as far away as Oahu.
