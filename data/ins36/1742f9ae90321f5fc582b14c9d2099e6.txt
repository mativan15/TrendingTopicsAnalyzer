Graham Potter has claimed Erik Ten Hag has made his Manchester United a more direct team since beating them with his Brighton in the opening match of the season. The Seagulls gave the Dutchman a humbling introduction by winning 2-1 at Old Trafford on August 7. Brighton also thrashed Ralf Rangnick's side 4-0 at the Amex Stadium in May. Potter moved to Chelsea last month and is unbeaten in his first seven games. But Ten Hag has also improved his team and the Old Trafford club gave their best performance of the season in beating Tottenham on Wednesday night.
