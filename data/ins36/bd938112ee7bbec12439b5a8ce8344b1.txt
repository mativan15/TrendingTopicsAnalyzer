After a rough few weeks of headlines about his health and tightening poll numbers, the John Fetterman campaign would like to have some fun again.

The Pennsylvania lieutenant governor and Democratic candidate for US Senate on Wednesday launched a new website, Fettermemes.com, that opens to the public a small library of multimedia featuring his Republican opponent, Mehmet Oz, with the express hope that people will create new memes.

'We have a base of supporters that are enthusiastic and engaged online and off, but I think especially online like no one in politics has ever seen before,' campaign spokesperson Emilia Rowland told BuzzFeed News.
