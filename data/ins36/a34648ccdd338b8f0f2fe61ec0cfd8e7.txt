SANAA, Yemen — Yemen's Iran-backed rebels said they targeted a cargo ship Friday off an oil terminal in the war-wrecked Arab country's south to prevent their rivals, the pro-government forces, from using it for oil exports.

The statement was the first announced military action since a truce between the country's warring sides expired earlier earlier this month.

The Houthis said the attack in the port of Dabba, in Yemen's eastern province of Hadramawt province, was a "warning strike." The territory is controlled by the country's internationally recognized government.
