North Macedonia and Montenegro will not compete in 2023's Eurovision Song Contest.

According to a statement released by the broadcasters of both countries, the cost of participating in the multi-national music competition has been a key factor in causing them to drop out.

These countries join Russia on the list of non-participating nations so far. Russia was banned from competiting in the 2022 competition due to the country's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, with the ban remaining in place for next year.
