Kansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes is set to participate in Capital One's 'The Match' on Wednesday.
Mahomes is just a quarter of the NFL star power set to participate in the fourth iteration of the Sports Emmy-nominated charity golf event series. Mahomes will be joined by Buffalo Bills QB Josh Allen to face off against Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers for ultimate bragging rights on the golf course. There has been plenty of trash talk ahead of this game, but today each player will get a chance to put their money where their mouth is.
