Strictly Come Dancing 2022 star Fleur East has come to the defence of Shirley Ballas after the judge was criticised for her decision in last week's dance off, calling the trolling ‘unfair'.
During the most recent results show on the BBC programme, singer Fleur and her partner Vito Coppola ended up in the bottom two opposite radio personality Richie Anderson and his partner Giovanni Pernice.
Judges Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse and Anton Du Beke all voted to save Fleur and Vito, while Shirley revealed that she would have chosen to keep Richie and Giovanni in the competition.
