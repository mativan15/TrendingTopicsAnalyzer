zorazhuang/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Deutsche Bank thinks the current quarter likely marks a bottom for Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), which is already on a roll after last week's earnings beat - and that gradual quarterly improvement will begin from the third quarter on. Analyst Leo Chiang says recovery is under way but exactly how fast that happens depends on the macroeconomic situation and what happens with COVID-19 from here. The company is facing a tougher operating environment in Q2 than in Q1 in its ads and cloud businesses, but Chiang expects tough cost controls to stick around until a more meaningful improvement for revenues.
