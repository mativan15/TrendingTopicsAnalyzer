Liam Payne has suggested that his multi-million pound fortune is all for his son Bear Payne, revealing that he will hand over several companies to his child when he is older. The singer, 28, opened up about parenthood on the latest episode of the Impaulsive podcast earlier this week, during which he was interviewed by its host Logan Paul, 27. The One Direction member spoke during the episode about being a father to son Bear, five, whom he shares with his ex Cheryl, 38 - who was his partner from 2016 to 2018.
