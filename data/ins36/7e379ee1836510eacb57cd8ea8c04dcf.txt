When Will Germaine, 20, of Valley Stream, NY, recently needed professional attire for his new role as student government president, the community health student at Hofstra University didn't shop online or drive to the nearest mall. Instead, he cruised the racks at Hofstra's 'career closet' at the campus health and wellness center.
Since opening this permanent location in September, the campus boutique allows students to select new and gently used work attire for internships, job interviews, networking and professional events.
