WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Education on Wednesday said it will cancel all remaining federal student loans used to attend any campus of for-profit Corinthian Colleges Inc, which shut down in 2015 amid multiple federal and state investigations into whether it misled investors and students.

The decision, which Vice President Kamala Harris will discuss publicly on Thursday, will result in $5.8 billion in loan forgiveness for 560,000 borrowers, the largest single such move ever made by the department, department officials said.
