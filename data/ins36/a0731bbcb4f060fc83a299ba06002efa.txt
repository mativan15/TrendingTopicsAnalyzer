Following the reports that newly introduced heat-tolerant PBW 826 wheat variety was being sold at premium price despite the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) having officially exhausted the initial stock, the Ludhiana agriculture department swung into action and carried out a surprise raid at a seed store and godown here on Monday night. Ludhiana chief agricultural officer Amanjit Singh said 28 gunny bags of PBW 826 seed weighing 140kg, which were hidden under a pile of sacks and covered with tarpaulin, were seized.
