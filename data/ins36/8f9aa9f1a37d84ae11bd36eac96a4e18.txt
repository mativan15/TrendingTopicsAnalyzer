A Florida realtor is already seeing people looking for properties in Hurricane-ravaged Florida, according to NewsNation.

"There are some that have been scared away and equally as many who say this is my time to swoop in and make a deal," said Kristen Conti, realtor of Peacock Premier Properties, on the evening program "Rush Hour" on Wednesday.

In late September, Hurricane Ian swept through Florida, killing over 100, and the "indirect" death count, between medical issues and other factors, could be in the thousands, according to the Sun-Sentinel.
