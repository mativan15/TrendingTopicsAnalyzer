UPDATE: Amazon is having a PS5 restock right now, but you have to request an invite on the site to get access which is new. We will keep tracking this. It's been a rough couple of months for anyone trying to track down a PS5 restock at a major retailer, but today Walmart is hosting a huge event that everyone can get in on. As a part of its Walmart Plus day, a PS5 restock will be taking place at 3 p.m. ET (12 p.m. PT). To participate in this PS5 restock event, you'll need a Walmart Plus subscription -- if you don't have one already you can get one here and get in line early.
