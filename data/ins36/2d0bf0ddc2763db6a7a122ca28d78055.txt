PITTSBURGH (AP) — The Pittsburgh Steelers placed rookie defensive end DeMarvin Leal on injured reserve Saturday with a knee injury, the latest setback for a banged-up defense that will be extremely shorthanded on Sunday against Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Leal's play had been one of the few bright spots for the Steelers (1-4), who have dropped four straight and suffered the franchise's worst loss in 33 years last weekend in Buffalo.

Leal, a third-round pick out of Texas A&M, was hurt late in the week.
