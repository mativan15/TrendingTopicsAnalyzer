Former agriculture minister David Littleproud has ousted Barnaby Joyce to become Nationals leader. Perin Davey, a senator since 2019, has been elected his deputy. Littleproud, 45, who was deputy leader, is from Queensland; Davey, 50, is from New South Wales. Bridget McKenzie, from Victoria, remains the party's senate leader. The Liberals, as expected, elected Queenslander Peter Dutton, 51, and Sussan Ley, 60, from NSW, as leader and deputy, respectively, after the pair stood unopposed. Dutton immediately pitched to the suburbs and small business.
