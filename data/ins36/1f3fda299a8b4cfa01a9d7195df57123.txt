Labour has taken a huge 36-point lead over the Conservatives, according to a recent poll which would see the governing party facing electoral wipeout if a general election were to be held soon.Keir Starmer's party has surged ahead in voting intention surveys following weeks of economic chaos caused by Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-Budget, most of which was dramatically reversed by new chancellor Jeremy Hunt on Monday.Mr Starmer has said that his party is ready to deliver an election manifesto "at speed" and this week members of his shadow cabinet began receiving training on how to govern, delivered by the Institute for Government think tank.
