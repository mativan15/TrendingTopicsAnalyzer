​Southland Hospital will continue pausing services and sending patients elsewhere in the forseeable future as country struggles to recruit during international workforce shortages. Minister of Health Andrew Little said the problems at the hospital were recruitment, not money. 'The Government has provided the money needed to hire more staff, but the challenge is filling those positions.' Little was responding to comments made earlier this month by health advocate Melissa Vining who warned Southland Hospital was 'on the brink of collapse'.
