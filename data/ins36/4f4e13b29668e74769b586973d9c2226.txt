The First Minister has been urged to publish any economic modelling done of the impact of border checks with England after independence.Nicola Sturgeon outlined her Government's proposals for the economy in a post-independence Scotland on Monday, including some detail about the border between Scotland and England.While border arrangements will be subject to negotiations between the two nations, Scotland re-joining the EU – one of the Scottish Government's key objectives – would complicate border crossings.
