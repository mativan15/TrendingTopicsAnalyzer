Eddie Howe is determined to keep Newcastle grounded despite seeing his new-look team touted as European contenders.

The Magpies head into the weekend sitting in sixth place in the Premier League table, just a point behind Manchester United, whom they face at Old Trafford on Sunday at the start of a week which could go a long way towards establishing their credentials for this campaign.

Howe's men, who have beaten Fulham 4-1 and Brentford 5-1 in their last two outings, travel to United and Tottenham either side of Everton's midweek visit to St James' Park, and the head coach is treating a difficult run of fixtures as a barometer of their development to date.
