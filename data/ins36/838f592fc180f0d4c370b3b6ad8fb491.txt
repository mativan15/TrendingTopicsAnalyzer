AT&T is giving its new mid-band 5G network a stealthy rollout throughout New York City, and we have the first exclusive test results. They show that if you've been struggling along with an iPhone 11 or XR on AT&T, it's finally time to switch to a new 5G phone.Big Blue has had America's strongest 4G network in our tests since 2019, but it was outpaced by both Verizon and T-Mobile where mid- or high-band 5G was available in 2020 and 2021. In recent months, Verizon has announced a massive expansion of its faster mid-band 5G network, while AT&T has only announced eight cities, and doesn't show mid-band on maps.
