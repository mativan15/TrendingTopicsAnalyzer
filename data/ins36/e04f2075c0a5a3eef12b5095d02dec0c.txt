India has a surplus of federally held stocks of rice and wheat, and the government could intervene in the open market 'if needed' by selling cereals at a discount to curb prices, food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said on Monday. The government expected sufficient output of kharif or summer-sown rice currently being harvested and hopes to procure 77 million tonnes of paddy, compared to the previous year's 78 million tonnes, Pandey said. The government's paddy stocks could go up to 90 million tonnes, taking into projections the upcoming winter-sown rice season.
