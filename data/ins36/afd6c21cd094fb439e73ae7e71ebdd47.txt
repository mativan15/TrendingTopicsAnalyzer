India's largest steel producer, , will continue to supply products to its buyers in Europe without passing on any increase in costs despite New Delhi's decision to impose an export tax, a senior company official said on Monday. India recently imposed an export tax of 15% on some steel products from zero, at a time the country's steelmakers were looking to make up for tepid local demand by increasing market share in Europe, where the Ukraine conflict has hit supplies.
 The government also scrapped import duty on coking coal, a key steelmaking raw material, and raised export tariffs on iron ores and concentrates to 50% from 30%.
