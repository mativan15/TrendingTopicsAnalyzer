The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a plea to cancel the bail granted to Chhattisgarh's former additional director general of police, Gurjinder Pal Singh — accused of amassing disproportionate assets — maintaining that a person's status does not count while granting bail. 'While considering bail, status of person is not to be considered,' said a bench of justices BR Gavai and Hima Kohli on Tuesday before dismissing a petition filed by Chhattisgarh government challenging the bail granted to the suspended officer by the state high court on May 12.
