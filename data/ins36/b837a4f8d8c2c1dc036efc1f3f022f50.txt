A husband and sole income earner has divided opinion online after demanding his wife use some of the money she received as inheritance to pay off his student loans.However, his other half has so far refused, telling him "the inheritance belongs only to her."They say that money is the root of all evil and, when it comes to relationships, that old adage does appear to ring true. A 2019 University of Tennessee study found that, regardless of whether the relationship was a happy or healthy one, money was what couples disagreed about most.
