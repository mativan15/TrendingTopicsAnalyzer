Malaysia has announced Visa on Arrival (VOA) for some Indian travellers, starting June 1. Travellers arriving in Malaysia through selected entry points via Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, or Indonesia, with a valid visa from either country can avail this benefit.

The VOA fee will be MYR 200 ($46), and travellers will be required to show proof that they have at least $500 cash/debit card/credit card/traveller's cheque or any electronic money, which is certified by the Central Bank of Malaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia).
