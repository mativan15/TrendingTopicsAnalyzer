US oil giant Exxon Mobil says it has discontinued operations at the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in Russia's Far East. Exxon told NHK on Thursday that the Russian government unilaterally terminated the company's interests in the Sakhalin-1, and that the project has been transferred to a Russian operator. A new entity to take over the project was set up last Friday, one day after the Russian government issued a decree to that end. In March, Exxon announced its intention to end its operations in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
