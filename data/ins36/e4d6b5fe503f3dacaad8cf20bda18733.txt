aydinmutlu/iStock via Getty Images Investment summary We continue to rate TransMedics Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMDX) a speculative buy following the previous analysis (see: here). Deeper analysis of the company's fundamentals reveals TMDX's invested capital and return on investment trends have curled off FY21 lows and are heading towards a magnet of profitability into the coming periods. Additionally, with management's upgraded guidance from the last earnings call, we propose that TMDX will continue to gain market share as a differentiated player in the organ transplant space.
