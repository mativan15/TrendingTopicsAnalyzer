Bank of America is undeniably a large bank. Just on account of its size, you can expect that it generates a fair amount of customer complaints, and that's true. Even so, reviews generally aren't favorable.
According to the Better Business Bureau (BBB), it's closed nearly 3,000 complaints with Bank of America in just the past year alone.
