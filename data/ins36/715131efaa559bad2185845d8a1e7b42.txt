Having an emergency fund to dip into in the case of a leaky roof, sporting injury or some other disaster is a great way to protect yourself and your finances.

However, in a time of massive mortgage repayments , skyrocketing rent and the high cost of living , it can be challenging to get this money together. In fact, according to Canstar research, more than a third of Australians don't have an emergency fund.

Plus, with interest rates on savings accounts historically low - albeit starting to rise - you might be wondering if there are better options for putting together an emergency fund.
