A set of strange incidents took place in 1779. The zamindar of Kasijura (in present-day Odisha) Raja Sunder owed money to Narain Kashinath, a prominent merchant of Calcutta. After having exhausted several avenues to recover his money, he finally approached the Supreme Court. The first Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William in Calcutta, was the highest-level of judiciary in those days. Under the Regulating Act of 1773 was formed the highest-level of the executive, the Governor-General and his council of five members, referred to as the Supreme Council.
