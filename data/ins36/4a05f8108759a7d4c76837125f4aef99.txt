Private investment in space continues to be battered by larger macro-economic trends, like high interest rates and inflation, but not all sectors of the space industry are affected equally, a new report from New York-based VC firm Space Capital found.
While broader market conditions are disproportionately affecting funding in deep tech – which includes high capex industries like launch and 'emerging industries' (think private space stations and orbital debris mitigation) – geospatial intelligence and remote sensing companies are well-positioned to withstand these trends, the quarterly report found.
