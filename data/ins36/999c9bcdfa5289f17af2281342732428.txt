AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) — Broadcasters were criticized by FIFA president Gianni Infantino on Saturday for what he called unacceptably low offers for rights to screen the Women's World Cup next year.

Offers of just 1% of the value of men's World Cup rights deals have been rejected, Infantino said, for the tournament that starts in July in Australia and New Zealand.

The men's World Cup has driven FIFA's expected overall income toward $7 billion for the four-year commercial cycle that ends in December after that tournament in Qatar.
