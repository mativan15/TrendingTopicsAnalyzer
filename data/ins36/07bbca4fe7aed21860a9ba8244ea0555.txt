At this point, it is impossible to know what exactly the Pittsburgh Steelers have as a team. The same team that beat the Cincinnati Bengals and Tampa Bay Buccaneers got blown out by the Buffalo Bills and lost to the New York Jets.

So whichever version of the Steelers we get for the remainder of the season, my money is on both, this team is still working on a rebuild. This means there will be a need for players. Whether this means bringing in veterans or draft picks, trading a player or two could help.
