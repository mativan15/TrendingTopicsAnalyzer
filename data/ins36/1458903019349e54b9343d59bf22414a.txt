The City of Calgary and the owners of the Calgary Flames upgraded their relationship status Wednesday to something a little more serious. The city issued a release stating that they've agreed to begin formal negotiations with Calgary Sports and Entertainment Corporation on the terms of a new event centre that would house the Flames, Hitmen, Roughnecks, big-name concerts, and high-profile comedians. "We're at the beginning of an important stage," said Ward 1 Coun. Sonya Sharp, chair of the event centre committee.
