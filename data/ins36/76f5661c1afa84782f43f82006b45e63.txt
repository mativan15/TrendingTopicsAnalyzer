Wait times for Winnipeg ambulances continue to climb, according to new numbers from the Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service (WFPS).
The average wait time for an ambulance in the city in 2022 is just under 21 minutes — an increase from 13 back in 2015.For calls that are deemed non-emergent, the response time has doubled over the past five years to nearly 41 minutes from 20.WFPS chief Christian Schmidt, however, said despite the increases, the service is still able to get a trained professional — if not an ambulance — to a patient's side in a much quicker timeframe in emergency situations.
