The chronic skills shortage is a new problem for many employers, but not for Trudi Ballantyne, who long ago decided to tell her employees she would pay them not to work. Ballantyne runs a Te Puke-based rural accounting firm called Stem and three years ago decided to put in place a scheme to pay workers for a full day, but have them work six hours. The move wasn't just about giving people more time off, but expanding how far away people could commute from. Te Puke is half an hour away from Tauranga, so the new initiative effectively paid anybody living in Tauranga for their commuting time.
