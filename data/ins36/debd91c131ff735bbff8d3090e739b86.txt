In this week's episode of 'Chicago This Week,' we welcome summer. Chicagoans return to the lake for the opening of beach season and take to the parks to picnic and explore. We'll show you some great spots to eat and drink outside this time of year.

'Chicago This Week' is a half-hour show that features news, sports, business and entertainment stories from around Chicago. All the producing, reporting, writing, shooting and editing is done by Medill graduate students.
