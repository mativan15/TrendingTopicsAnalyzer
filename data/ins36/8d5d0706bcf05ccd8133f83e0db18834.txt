Indoor cycling apps are changing the way many riders view training indoors.

Instead of having to head out for a cycle in the pouring rain, cycling apps allow riders to challenge themselves and interact with others from the comfort of their own homes.

While the apps keep riders inside, a supposed attack on the nature of cycling, they're becoming increasingly more sophisticated and enjoyable to use. Riders can become immersed in their ride, exploring terrains they would never usually have the opportunity to.
