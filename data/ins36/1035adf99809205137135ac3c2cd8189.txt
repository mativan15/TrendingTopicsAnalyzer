The Covid-19 situation resulted in schools in India and elsewhere remaining shut for a long time. Since the last couple of months, schools started reopening in different states and that brought a lot of cheer among students who missed visiting their school premises and attending offline classes. However, like every year, schools did declare summer vacations and that led to children being away from their schools for a while. While children enjoy going on a holiday with their families or indulging in some hobby during their summer vacations, many of them miss the fun and learning atmosphere their school provides them with.
