The crypto crash isn't the only way the decentralized currency can lose its holders a lot of real money. According to a new report from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), cryptocurrency is increasingly used as part of scams, either as an integral part of the scam itself or just the way scammers want to be paid.
The FTC says 46,000 people reported losing more than $1 billion worth of crypto in scams between January 2021 and March 2022, noting that this number is only the people who reported their losses to the FTC.
