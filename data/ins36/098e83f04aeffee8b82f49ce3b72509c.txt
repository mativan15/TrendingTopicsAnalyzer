San Francisco: The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now after Tesla CEO Elon Musk over late disclosure about his substantial stake in Twitter. According to reports, the SEC told Musk that he "does not appear" to have disclosed his acquisition of Twitter shares within the commission's required 10-day window. The SEC said that Musk "likely used the wrong form when he eventually disclosed his stake", reports The Verge. The letter, filed last month and made public now, asked clarifications from Musk on "why he chose to use a form meant for passive investors and whether the agency is wrong about his filing coming in late".
