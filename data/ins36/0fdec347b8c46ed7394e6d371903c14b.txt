The Government's response to the apparent beating of a protester by Chinese diplomats is "wholly inadequate", Sir Iain Duncan Smith has said as he called on ministers to move to expel them from the country.
Zheng Xiyuan, China's consul-general, was named in Parliament alongside four other diplomats as being involved in the incident in Manchester on Sunday, during which they clashed with protesters. Bob Chan, a pro-democracy activist, was dragged on to consulate grounds and attacked.
Sir Iain said it was "an assault on people in the United Kingdom, against all the rights that we hold dear and against our freedoms", and demanded to know what the Government intended to do.
