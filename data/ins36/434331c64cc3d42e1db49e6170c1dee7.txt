Flyers claim a forward who Tortorella knows pretty well originally appeared on NBC Sports Philadelphia

For added depth up front, the Flyers on Wednesday acquired a forward who John Tortorella is familiar with from his days in Columbus.

The club claimed Lukas Sedlak off of waivers from the Avalanche. The 29-year-old played for Tortorella's Blue Jackets from 2016-17 to 2018-19.

After going to the KHL for the past three seasons, Sedlak returned to the NHL in the summer when he signed a one-year, $800,000 deal with the Avalanche.
