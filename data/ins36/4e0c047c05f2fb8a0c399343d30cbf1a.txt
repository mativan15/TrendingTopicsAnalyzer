Tickets for next year's Glastonbury Festival will see a price hike to £340 when they go on sale in early November, organisers have confirmed.
It's a shocking rise considering the last time tickets went on general sale in 2019 they were priced at £265 plus a £5 booking fee for what should have been the 2020 festival.
Of course, that year, was of course subsequently cancelled twice due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Tickets for 2019's festival were sold in 2018 for £248, plus a £5 booking fee.
The price rise comes as many businesses and individuals struggle during the cost-of-living crisis as energy costs soar and inflation remains high.
