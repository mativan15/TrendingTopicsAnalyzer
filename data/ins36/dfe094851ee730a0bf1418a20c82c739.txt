Streamer and adult performer Kaitlyn Sisagura, known online as Amouranth, has returned to Twitch after a viral video where she said that her husband was financially and emotionally abusing her.

Until her Sunday video, she'd never revealed that she was married. Sitting in a bedroom, Sisagura shows texts of her husband Nick Lee calling her names like 'dumb fuck.' She livestreams a phone conversation between them in which he shouts expletives at her and tells her to 'leave the house.'
