A green think tank has estimated that the UK has squandered a major opportunity to slash household energy bills by offering a major tax break for oil and gas exploitation. Alongside imposing a windfall tax on the bumper profits gained by energy companies, Mr Sunak offered a 91 percent tax break for oil and gas exploration.The think tank believes that the tax break has led to the UK missing out on billions in revenue, which could have been used to permanently slash the energy bills of two million households in the UK through home insulation measures.
