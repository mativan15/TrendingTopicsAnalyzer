State-owned , and may not go ahead with a proposed pipeline monetisation plan, having convinced the petroleum ministry that this would be an expensive way to raise capital, said people familiar with the matter. The government expected the companies to transfer some of their pipelines to separate infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) and sell minority stakes in those to raise ₹17,000 crore. The companies have told the government that their high credit ratings, among the best in the country, will allow them to raise capital easily and at a much lower cost than any return they would have to offer InvIT investors, said the people cited above.
