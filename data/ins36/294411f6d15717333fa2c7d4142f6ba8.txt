Music-industry monopoly Live Nation/Ticketmaster, which wants to build a controversial concert venue on the site of the old Bradley Center in Milwaukee, is the 'Walmart of promoters.' They've 'built a business going into cities and either acquiring and downsizing local independent promoters … or simply running them out of business.'

But those weren't my words.

These were the words of Charlie Goldstone, president of Live Nation/Ticketmaster-owned FPC. He made those remarks in 2014, before the anti-competitive behemoth – just like he predicted they might – acquired FPC.
