Gas prices show no signs of slowing this year. While experts predict US national average per gallon prices above $6 this summer, costs at the pump have already passed $7 in many parts of California. The right gas credit cards can ease that pain a bit. Most gas credit cards give you rewards when you spend money to fill up your tank. Some provide rewards for specific gas stations, while others give you cash back on gasoline purchases anywhere. And a few give money back for purchases on all sorts of categories, like restaurants, hotels or airplane tickets.
