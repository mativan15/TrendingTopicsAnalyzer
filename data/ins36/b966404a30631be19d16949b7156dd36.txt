It doesn't take a genius to see that Tennessee Titans defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons is, at the very least, on a fast track to becoming one of the best defensive players in the entire league, if he isn't there already.

Simmons is the type of disruptive defender that even the most casual football fan would be mesmerized by whenever they take the time to watch a Titans game.

The Mississippi State product has been a game-wrecker all year long, and unsurprisingly, he grades out as one of the best pass-rushers in the NFL.
