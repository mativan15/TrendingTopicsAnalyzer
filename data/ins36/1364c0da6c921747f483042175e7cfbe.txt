Calgary Flames fans got their first look at the team's reverse retro jersey for the 2022-23 season on Thursday. The jersey, made by Adidas, is a twist on the design the team sported in the mid-90s. It features a black background with a white flaming 'C' and a diagonal "pedestal" hem stripe. "This unique stripe breaks across the traditional horizontal pattern to align under the crest with similarly angled sleeve stripes complimenting the look," said Adidas in a news release. The NHL Shield logo is "remixed" in vintage orange and black colors.
