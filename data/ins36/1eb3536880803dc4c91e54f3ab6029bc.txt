The AAP government in Punjab backed Mann for his stand on SYL even as the Opposition trained barbs at him. Calling him a 'son of the soil who stood firmly to protect Punjab waters', Cabinet minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal said that the interests of the state are completely protected under Mann's leadership. Dhaliwal added that Mann's firm stand with facts had left the opposition speechless. 'The Opposition parties that are advising our government now had clandestinely laid the foundation of this canal for their vested political interests,' he said.
