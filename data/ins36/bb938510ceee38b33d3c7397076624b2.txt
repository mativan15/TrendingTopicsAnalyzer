Many of the farmers in this Punjab village admit that they are going to burn the paddy stubble left after the harvest — the main source of pollution in the National Capital Region in October and November. Most are also desperate to move out of the paddy-wheat cycle of cropping. The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has warned them that they have groundwater left for 15 more years — at a stretch. As they prepare to harvest their nearly mature paddy crop, they say they have realised that farming has become unsustainable for several reasons: a water table that has fallen to the 'red', or 'overexploited' category; rising costs of pesticide and other inputs; extreme weather events such as unseasonal rain of the sort that hit all of northwest India in early October; and the problem of dealing with paddy stubble.
