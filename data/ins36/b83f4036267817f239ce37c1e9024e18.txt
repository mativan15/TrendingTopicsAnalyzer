Nissan Motor is gearing up to intensify rivalry in the SUV segments in India. The three SUVs, one of which is set to make a comeback to India, will be positioned from the compact to the mid-size segments when launched.
 








Nissan Motor has lined up three SUVs for India which are currently undergoing tests. Among the three models is the new X-Trail, which is set to make a comeback to India after eight years.
