Mumbai: The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) demanded a judicial probe into the Maharashtra government's decision to refuse permission to the city police to prosecute senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Rashmi Shukla in an alleged phone-tapping case registered in the Colaba police station. NCP chief spokesperson Mahesh Tapase said the state's decision was akin to giving Shukla a 'pardon' though there are cases registered against Shukla.'Let the court investigate and decide who is guilty and not the government,' Tapase said on Friday.
