Oct. 15—Adrian Briones grew up in Huntsville and graduated from Huntsville High School in 2002 before heading to Tyler Junior College (TJC) as a walk-on defensive end.

After spending two years at TJC, he would transfer to Belhaven College in Jackson, Miss., to finish his playing career.

Now, Briones is currently the associate director of football performance for UCLA and helps create plans for injured offensive and defensive big-skill players to return to the field. He moved into the role after being at the University of Southern California as an assistant strength and conditioning coach for football during 2020 and 2021.
