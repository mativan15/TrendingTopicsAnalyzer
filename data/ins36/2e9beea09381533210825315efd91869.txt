I've already purchased three vinyl records for an album I haven't heard a single note of. It's not unusual to preorder music—especially from a major artist like Taylor Swift, who typically puts together monthslong album rollouts to drum up interest in—and presales of—her forthcoming records. (Her surprise 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore were exceptions to this.) But three vinyls is a bit excessive, even for a longtime fan like myself. At $35 a pop (plus shipping, since they were released at different times and purchased from different stores), I've spent close to $100 for the same 13-track record.
