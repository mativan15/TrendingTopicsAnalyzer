Brian Daboll knew how Kayvon Thibodeaux would handle not having a sack five games into his rookie season because the Giants head coach asked the first-round draft pick about it the first time that they met.
In a meeting at the NFL combine in February, Daboll accidentally spoke of a possible scenario in which Thibodeaux was playing for the Giants and facing mounting pressure to get his first sack after five games.
'We're going to figure out how next week we're going to take advantage of whoever we play and get three sacks,' Thibodeaux said at the time, per Giants.
