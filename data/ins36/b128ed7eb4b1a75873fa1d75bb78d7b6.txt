3:19 AM ETPHOENIX -- The first half of Wednesday night's season opener conjured up the still-fresh painful feelings from last spring's embarrassing playoff exit for the Phoenix Suns. Once again, the Suns were being dominated by Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks at home.That made the rally from a 22-point deficit for a 107-105 win at the Footprint Center that much sweeter for the Suns."If you get your asses kicked, you want to get your get-back," Devin Booker told ESPN's Jorge Sedano during the postgame on-court interview, acknowledging the humiliation from a 33-point blowout loss in Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals.
