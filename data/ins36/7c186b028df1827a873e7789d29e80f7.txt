Hello and welcome to Friday.Dear Pat Riley — Well, guess Sen. Marco Rubio won't be cheering on his hometown team tonight as they try to stay alive in the NBA playoffs.Taking it to the team — Rubio late Wednesday and early Thursday morning ripped into the Miami Heat over the team's decision to air a commercial that criticized Florida's voting laws and for its decision to encourage fans to call Rubio and Sen. Rick Scott and ask for 'common sense gun laws.' The team made the request on gun legislation after it held a moment of silence for the victims of this week's horrific school shooting in Texas.
