I'd do the same if I were in her position, as in donating a shitload of money to institutions/organizations I believe in. There's absolutely nothing empowering or even remotely decent about having obscene amounts of money, and I'd feel like a monster if I had more money than I could spend in a lifetime while so many people could make great use of it.
