Oil prices could stay elevated on the back of the recent OPEC+ decision to cut output by two million barrels a day , according to Bank of America. "The cut to oil production comes at a time when global inventories are already low and U.S. reserves are at levels not seen since the 1980s, pushing oil prices higher-for-longer," the bank's analysts wrote in an Oct. 17 note. They estimated that this could send oil prices to an average of $100 per barrel next year – 20% above consensus. Brent prices spiked to nearly $98 per barrel following the OPEC+ decision, but have since slipped, trading around $90 for Brent and $84 for WTI on Tuesday.
