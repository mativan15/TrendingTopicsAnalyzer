There's a reason why Japan is the only side not to have conceded a goal at the end of the group stage of the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup The 2014 champions maintained their all-win record with another flawless performance, this time knocking out France 2-0 at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Tuesday.Tanikawa Momoko and Kusunoki Sayami scored in either half, the second coming in added time through a powerful header from a corner-kick. Japan could and should have scored more, but it was their defensive solidity that caught the eye.
