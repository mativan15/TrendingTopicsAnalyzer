Mr Matheson, who denied the allegations, was facing a four-week suspension and had been asked to stand down as City of Chester MP by Labour.The Independent Expert Panel had released a report recommending suspension, after the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, upheld two allegations of sexual misconduct against Matheson by a former member of his staff, made under Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS).The sexual misconduct allegations that were upheld explained that the MP's behaviour ranged from attempting to kiss the member of staff on her mouth and making her hold his hand, to commenting on her appearance 'while looking at her suggestively'.
