How much someone is entitled to in regards to the state pension is dependent on their record of National Insurance contributions. As of April, the payment rate for benefits increased by 3.1 percent so the full new state pension is currently worth £185.15 per week for claimants. However, in order to get the full available amount, state pension claimants must have at least 35 years of National Insurance contributions under their belt before retirement.People who are employed usually have their National Insurance taken out automatically from their wages.
