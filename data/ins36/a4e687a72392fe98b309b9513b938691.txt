Continuing their gaining streak for the third straight session, the benchmark indices closed higher on Tuesday. The gains were led by heavyweight Reliance, banking and IT stocks. The 30-share Sensex ended 550 points higher at 58,960, while its broader peer, Nifty50, ended above the 17,450 mark. 'Benchmarks gained a percentage primarily led by the PSU banks as the pick up in the corporate loan cycle and retail loans during the festive season provided the much-needed Tailwinds," S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP Securities, said.
