In Ancient Egypt, stools were for commoners; chairs with backs and armrests were reserved for the elite. By the 5th century BCE, Ancient Greece had invented the klismos, a 'democratic' chair with outward-curved legs and a curved backrest, meant to be used widely, as a great equaliser.

Through the next 2,000 years, politics, economics, design and technology would alter the upright seat until it reached perhaps its apogee in 17th-century Mughal India, with emperor Shah Jahan's peacock throne, a gem-studded, gold-laden symbol of status and power.
