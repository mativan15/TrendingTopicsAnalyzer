Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News Investment Thesis Take a huge secular trend, add a rapidly growing, founder-led, industry-leading company, and combine that with a market that doesn't like anything technology related right now - the result? Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU). This is a company that has seen its share price fall dramatically over the past year, and in a world where streaming services such as Netflix (NFLX) are losing millions of subscribers, you might understand why. Yet Roku is not Netflix; it isn't losing subscribers, and it expects annual revenue growth of 35% in 2022 off the back of +50% revenue growth in both 2020 and 2021.
