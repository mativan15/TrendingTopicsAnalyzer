The Capitals, who lost three in a row to start the 2012-13 campaign, have yet to convert any of their nine power-play opportunities this season. They went 0-for-4 in a 5-2 setback to the Boston Bruins on Wednesday and 0-for-5 with the man advantage in a 3-2 defeat to the Toronto Maple Leafs the following night.
