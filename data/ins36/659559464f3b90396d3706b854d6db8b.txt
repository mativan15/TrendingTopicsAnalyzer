The Kerala high court on Thursday rejected the plea moved by the three accused in the alleged human sacrifice case questioning their 12-day police custody granted by the sessions court. However, the court allowed them to meet their lawyers for 15 minutes on alternate days, but the lawyers will not be permitted during interrogation. Dismissing their plea, justice Kauser Edappagath said the accused cannot dictate in what manner the investigation should be carried out. 'The gruesome murder of two women purportedly for human sacrifice has shocked the people of Kerala,' the judge observed while dismissing their petitions.
