Published: 12:07 EDT, 31 May 2022 | Updated: 12:09 EDT, 31 May 2022 Missguided - the women's only clothes website that fell into administration today - was founded 12 years ago by Nitin Passi, a 39-year-old former public schoolboy who became one of the most recognisable faces in the fast fashion industry. Passi, a fitness fanatic who drove a £300million pink Lamborghini, revolutionised online fashion retailing with his focus on social media endorsements by celebrities including Nicole Scherzinger, Sofia Richie and Jourdan Dunn - while tempting millions of young women to buy his products by advertising them on popular TV show like Love Island.
