A cabbie who deliberately drove a minibus at a cyclist who had criticised his driving faces a jail sentence.
Charles Yorston, 60, ‘jerked' his vehicle to the right just as Andrew Learmonth drew level with his window.
The resulting impact sent Mr Learmonth, a prison officer out for an evening ride, into mid-air.
Tangled in the wreckage of his bike, he was thrown right across the road and struck his head on the far kerb, cracking his helmet and leaving him with cuts, bruises, and a fractured right elbow that still causes him pain nearly three years later.
