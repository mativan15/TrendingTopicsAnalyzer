With Vagahau Niue on the world's list of endangered languages once again, the government says it's concerned about preserving it for the next generations of Niueans. This week is Niue Language Week, or Faahi Tapu he Vagahau Niue, dedicated to a language listed by Unesco as 'definitely endangered'. Minister for Pacific Peoples Aupito William Sio joined members and leaders of the Niuean Community to celebrate the beginning of the week on Sunday at south Auckland's Favona School, home to the country's only Vagahau Niue bilingual class.
