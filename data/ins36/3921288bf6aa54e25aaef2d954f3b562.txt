NEW DELHI: With the Congress set to vote to elect its new chief, it would be the sixth time in its nearly 137-year-old history that an electoral contest would decide who would take up the mantle of the party's president.Also, with Sonia Gandhi Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra not in the running for the party president's post, a non-Gandhi would be at the helm after over 24 years following the polling on Monday and counting on Wednesday.Senior party leaders Mallikarjun Kharge and Shashi Tharoor are pitted against each other and have been crisscrossing various state capitals to woo the over 9,000 Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) delegates who comprise the electoral college for electing the party chief.
