The LA woman who suffered a traumatic brain injury when a homeless man stabbed her in the head with gardening shears FaceTimed her mom after the brutal attack — and her first words were: 'Mom, this is serious, I've been stabbed!'
Kyli Watts, 24, was walking in North Hollywood about 11:30 a.m. Oct. 10 when 30-year-old Jonathan Cole allegedly rammed the tool with 4-inch blades into the back of her head for no apparent reason, police said.
With the shears still embedded in her skull, Watts ran to a nearby restaurant, where she called 911 and FaceTimed her mother, Amy Watts, a psychiatric nurse in North Carolina.
