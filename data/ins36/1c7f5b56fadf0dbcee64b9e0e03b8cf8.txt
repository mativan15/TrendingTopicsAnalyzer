Six months after its most recent competitive match, the Ukraine men's soccer team returns to action Wednesday as its circuitous World Cup qualification path winds through Scotland. Ukraine and Scotland will meet in Glasgow after their initial contest was postponed by FIFA in March because Ukraine could not field a team after Russia invaded weeks before. The winner of Wednesday's match will face Wales on Sunday for a place in this year's World Cup in Qatar, where that team will join England, the United States and Iran in Group B.
