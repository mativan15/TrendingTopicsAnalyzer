More than half of Michigan's local officials say that moving government meetings online during the pandemic decreased the overall quality of such gatherings, according to a University of Michigan survey.

The finding comes from the spring 2021 wave of the Michigan Public Policy Survey conducted by the Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, which first asked local leaders questions about online presence a decade ago.

The survey found a gap in online presence between larger urban jurisdictions, which tend to have more resources and staffing to devote to their websites and are more likely to provide various high-tech online offerings, compared with smaller rural jurisdictions, which often have fewer resources and provide fewer services.
