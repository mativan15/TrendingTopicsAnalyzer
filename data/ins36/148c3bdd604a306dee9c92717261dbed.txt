Lupita Nyong'o has never forgotten the sense and sensibility that Emma Thompson instilled in her when she first burst into the industry.

The Black Panther: Wakanda Forever star told The Hollywood Reporter that she was often encouraged by fellow actors to "strike now" after winning an Academy Award in 2014 for 12 Years a Slave. Instead of rushing into another role, Nyong'o said that Thompson — whom she met on the awards circuit — advised that she take her time when it came to any major career decisions.
