The Bank of England's huge government bond holdings were a drain on the UK public finances for the first time ever last month.
The loss to taxpayers in September was £156m, ONS figures showed. That came as interest payments on the Bank's holdings totalled almost £1.6bn – eclipsing the roughly £1.4bn received in coupon income.
The figures reversed a trend of more than a decade where those bond holdings fed about £120bn to the Treasury and explain why the Government has had to earmark £11bn of cash to transfer to the central bank this year.
