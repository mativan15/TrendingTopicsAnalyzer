We're beyond the halfway point in Star Wars series Andor. Episode 7 landed on Disney Plus on Wednesday. After successfully stealing millions of credits from the Empire as part of a major rebel heist, Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) turned down an offer to betray his new allies and run off with the money.
Distraught after killing his would-be partner in crime, he goes it alone again. We know he'll be back with the rebels eventually though, since this is all part of his journey to becoming the morally questionable hero we meet in Rogue One.
