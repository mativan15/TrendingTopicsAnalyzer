In a stinging attack on the BJP-led Central government, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday said it wouldn't be surprising if the Enforcement Directorate issues summons against former Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, in the National Herald newspaper case and paste the notice on his memorial.
In his weekly column published in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana', Raut alleged that National Herald was like a weapon created by Nehru during the freedom struggle and not a property.
'When will traders in the present-day politics understand this?' asked Raut, who is the executive editor of Saamana, in an apparent jibe at the BJP.
