Crypto companies raised a record $30 billion of venture capital (VC) last year and the number of deals in the sector remains elevated despite the recent fall in cryptocurrency markets, Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a report Tuesday.

However, deal activity is likely to drop, mirroring trends in other VC categories, the report said.

The number of VC cryptocurrency investments peaked in December.
