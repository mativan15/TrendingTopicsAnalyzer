By Megumi Fujikawa TOKYO -- Japan's overall consumer inflation rose 3% from a year earlier in September, exceeding the Bank of Japan's 2% target for six consecutive months, government data showed Friday. The figure matched a 3% annual increase in August. Consumer prices excluding fresh food and energy prices rose 1.8% from a year earlier in September. Despite recent increases in prices, the Bank of Japan is likely to continue its ultra-easy monetary policy as it believes the increase is due mostly to temporary factors including higher energy prices.
