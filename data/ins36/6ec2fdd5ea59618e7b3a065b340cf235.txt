Former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan could be barred from standing for elected office Arif ALI AFP/File Islamabad (AFP) – Former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan could be barred from political office Friday when the election commission rules on charges he misled officials about gifts he received from foreign leaders while in power. The case is another twist in political wrangling that began even before Khan's April 10 ouster, and is one of several being fought by the former international cricket star and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party.
