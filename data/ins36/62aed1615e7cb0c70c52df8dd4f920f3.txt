The Congress leadership on Friday termed as "unacceptable" party leader Shivraj Patil's controversial statement equating Jihad with the Bhagwat Gita. After BJP lapped up the former Union Home Minister's comment to target the Congress, AICC spokesman Jairam Ramesh tweeted: "My senior colleague Shivraj Patil reportedly made some comments on the Bhagavad Gita that's unacceptable. Subsequently, he clarified. @INCIndia's stand is clear. Bhagavad Gita is a key foundational pillar of Indian civilisation.
