Thousands of farmers have been camping outside Punjab chief minister's house in Sangrur for the past nine days and plan to stay put till the state government accepts their slew of demands, mostly including compensations. The protesters, led by the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Ekta-Ugrahan, have occupied both sides of the three-kilometre stretch leading to Sangrur from the Patiala-Bathinda highway. At least 300 vehicles have been stationed there permanently, wherein farmers stay. Additional farmers join them, but leave by the evening.
