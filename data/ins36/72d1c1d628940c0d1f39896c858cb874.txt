Steve Jennings/Getty Images Entertainment Four of Coinbase Global's (NASDAQ:COIN) leaders have collectively reaped more than $1B by selling shares since the cryptocurrency exchange listed its shares for public trading last spring, according to analysis of regulatory filings by the Wall Street Journal. During the same period, though, the company's shares have dropped by 82% (as of Thursday's close). The four executives — co-founders Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, along with President and Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi and Chief Product Officer Surojit Chatterjee — received proceeds that totaled ~$1.
