Pay Dirt is Slate's money advice column. Have a question? Send it to Athena and Elizabeth here. (It's anonymous!) Dear Pay Dirt,  About a year ago, my wife and I had some hard discussions about her having to go to work to make ends meet financially. She had strong feelings about being a stay-at-home mom for our girls who are 8 and 12, while my position was from the financial side only. I was rather insensitive at the time in our discussions which did not help matters. Now, we have had a positive change in our finances, and she could leave her job and go back to being a stay-at-home mom, with our income staying where we need it to be to meet expenses and save for the future.
