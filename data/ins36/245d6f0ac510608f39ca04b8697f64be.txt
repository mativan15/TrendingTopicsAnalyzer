While water may seem like an important piece to making your car clean and shiny, it's not necessary. I'm not saying the tried-and-true bucket-and-sponge method isn't effective -- but if you live in a drought-ridden area with water restrictions or you're looking to cut back on water usage in general, a waterless car wash is the way to go. Even if you have a good car wash nearby that uses recycled water, I find a lot of car washes do a lousy job for a lot of money while lazily attacking my car with a pressure washer.
