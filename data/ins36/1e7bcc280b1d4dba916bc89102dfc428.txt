Dallas-based AT&T is in discussions with Morgan Stanley to bring in an infrastructure partner for a fiber-optic network expansion that is expected to be valued at $10 billion to $15 billion, according to Bloomberg.

According to the story, the discussions with the investors are early and could fall apart but AT&T is set to find a partner by this year or early 2023.

The investment comes as AT&T begins to deliver fiber connections past its 21-state phone territory and offer it to areas where only wireless service was previously available.
