The Atlantic's David Frum faced backlash on Twitter after he suggested the United States government should nationalize Elon Musk's Starlink company to provide free internet to Ukraine during their war with Russia.Frum argued on Monday that it is becoming too "unwise" to suspect that Musk will continue to provide Starlink satellite equipment to help Ukrainian citizens access the internet during Russia's invasion of the country. To remedy this, he suggested the U.S. government should seize and nationalize the company if Musk ever plans to pull his satellites.
