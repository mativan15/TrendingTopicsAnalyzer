We are buying 40 shares of Estee Lauder (EL) at roughly $202.18 a share. Following the trade, the Trust will own 210 shares of EL, increasing its weighting in the portfolio to 1.59% from 1.29%. In today's "Morning Meeting," we mentioned we would make our next purchase in Estee Lauder if the stock fell closer to $205 a share. With shares below that level in afternoon trading, we are making another small buy as part of our strategy to slowly scale into this position on weakness. Shares of this cosmetics giant have lagged in recent weeks for two reasons.
