Toilets can be difficult to clean, especially if you have hard water as limescale can build up. One hack cleaning enthusiasts claim to work is the 2p trick. Express.co.uk put this to Queen of Clean, Lynsey Crombie and she revealed the correct way to clean limescale from a toilet. According to many Mrs Hinch fans on the dedicated Facebook group, dropping a 2p coin into the toilet water can help break down the limescale. Some have even resorted to plunging the toilet water out, and then using a 2p coin to scrape the limescale out of the toilet bowl.
