The process to legalize adult-use cannabis in Germany has recently rekindled the interest of US and Canadian cannabis companies to invest in Europe. Canadian cannabis company Tilray said on Sept. 6 that it initiated a policy roundtable with German regulators on adult-use cannabis legalization in Germany. However, Burkhard Blienert, the commissioner on narcotic drugs at Germany's Federal Ministry of Health, corrected the company's claim clarifying that the meeting with Tilray consisted of a one-time conversation with several political representatives, as reported by MJBizDaily.
