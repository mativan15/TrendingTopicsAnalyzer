 The Maharashtra government on Wednesday lifted the stay on the land allotment decisions taken by the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) since June 1. An order issued to this effect by the industries department has, however, excluded Ambernath and Trans Thane Creek (TTC) MIDC in Navi Mumbai for now. The stay was imposed on August 8 after the chief minister's office sought a review of all the allotment proposals. The order affected 191 proposals covering 697 acres, which were expected to generate ₹12,000 crore in revenues.
