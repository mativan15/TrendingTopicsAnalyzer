After a slower-than-anticipated start, more interest in the Downtown Denver Partnership's incubator program could mean that businesses are, once again, ready to bet on the 16th Street Mall.

Out of five businesses selected to participate in the DDP's Popup Denver program to support local entrepreneurs and fill vacant storefronts on the mall, two have shuttered their doors, two have yet to begin their three-month pilot, and only one is still standing.

But that hasn't stopped potential downtown players from vying for the next five storefronts in the program.
