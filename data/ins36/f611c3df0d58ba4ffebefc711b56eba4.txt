Cornerback Alontae Taylor is set to return to the Saints lineup on Thursday night.

The second-round pick has missed the last four games with a knee injury, but returned to practice this week and the Saints announced that they have activated him on Thursday afternoon. Taylor appeared in the first two games of the season and had one pass defensed.

New Orleans made room for Taylor on the active roster by releasing wide receiver Keith Kirkwood.
