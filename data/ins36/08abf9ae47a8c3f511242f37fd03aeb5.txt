A new spacecraft shield is flying to orbit.The coating aims to hold off space radiation that can blast away at spacecraft surfaces, and cause problems with electrical shorting or overall erosion.Florida International University will launch the technology to the International Space Station this fall, although the institution hasn't specified exactly when (opens in new tab) or upon what spacecraft. A test sample will be mounted outside the orbiting facility for at least six months, to assess how well it performs in real life.
