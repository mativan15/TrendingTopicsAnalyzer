Liz Truss faces a showdown with rebellious MPs after declaring a vote on her controversial fracking plans a 'confidence motion in the Government'.
The Prime Minister has ordered backbenchers to support the contentious policy, even though many have openly expressed their opposition to it.
No 10's hardline approach will be seen as a major gamble, raising the stakes with a rank and file already in a mutinous state over her leadership.
Labour has tabled an opposition day debate motion that would guarantee Commons time to debate a new law to ban fracking once and for all.
