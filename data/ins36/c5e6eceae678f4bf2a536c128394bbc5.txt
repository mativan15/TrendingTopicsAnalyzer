A silver Roman penis pendant, described as a ‘significant national find' has been unearthed on a farm in Kent.
Metal detectorist Wendy Thompson discovered the phallic amulet, only the second silver such one to be found in the UK from the Roman era and with a unique design.
Wendy, 73, a retired estate agent, said: ‘It was only a tiny thing really. We were just as normal, covering a field up and down with a metal detector.
‘I turned over this spade of earth and there it was, about eight inches down, I guess.
