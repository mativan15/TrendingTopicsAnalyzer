5:05 PM ETBENTON HARBOR, Mich. -- Scott McCarron didn't have time to think about his surgically repaired left ankle on Friday. Mother Nature wouldn't let him."It was crazy," McCarron said of the weather changes.He shot a 5-under 66, including eight birdies, in the rain and wind at the Senior PGA Championship at Harbor Shores to share the early second-round lead at 8-under 134 with Canada's Stephen Ames, who also shot 66."Weather (when) we teed off ... was not too bad," McCarron said. "(It was) 60 (degrees) and then we got to the third hole, and I think it dropped 10 or 15 degrees.
