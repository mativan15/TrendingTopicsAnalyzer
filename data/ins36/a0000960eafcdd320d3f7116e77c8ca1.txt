Blackmores' biggest shareholder Marcus Blackmore has accused the vitamin maker's management of offering up too many excuses for poor performance and failing to align executive incentives with shareholder interests.

Blackmore, who owns a stake of around 20 per cent in the company, gave a spray to the company's board at its annual general meeting on Thursday, revealing he was voting against its remuneration report and short and long-term incentives set out for chief executive Alistair Symington for 2023.
