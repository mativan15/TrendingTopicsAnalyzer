LeBron James is still playing at an All-NBA level at 37.

But the Los Angeles Lakers have been able to take advantage of what James brings just once since he signed with them four years ago, winning a championship in 2020. They made the playoffs one other time and missed the playoffs twice.

That's not exactly what the Lakers had in mind when James left Cleveland in 2018, but here they are, searching for ways to rejoin the elite in the Western Conference, which is no easy task with Golden State, Phoenix the Los Angeles Clippers, Denver, Memphis and Dallas also in the mix.
