For a guy who once said he wasn't going to be on many future earnings calls, Elon Musk has a hard time staying away. Last night, Tesla reported its third quarter earnings, and Musk was front and center, making boastful claims about his company's future (bigger than Apple and Saudi Aramco), dropping hints about Tesla's next vehicle platform, hyping the much-delayed Cybertruck, and even offering some commentary on his on-again, off-again deal to buy Twitter. Musk defended the company's performance despite missing delivery and revenue expectations amid fears of softening demand for Tesla's vehicles.
