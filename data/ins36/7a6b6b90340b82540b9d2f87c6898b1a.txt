'Chor': Imran rips Pak PM after bypoll win; Shares 'solution' to economic crisis

Imran Khan rips apart Shehbaz Sharif after a big win in Pakistan's by-polls. The ex-Pak PM fired a 'chor and gaddaar' jibe at the ruling Shehbaz Sharif government. The former Pakistan Prime Minister said that he would die but not bow down to 'chors'. Imran Khan's 'chor' barb at the Shehbaz government comes just days after Pakistan Finance Minister Ishaq Dar was heckled at an airport in Washington, D.C. with similar chants.
