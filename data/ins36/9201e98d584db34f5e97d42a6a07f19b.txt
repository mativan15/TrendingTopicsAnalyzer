Dear Katie,
My husband and I booked dinner and a one-night stay at Restaurant Sat Bains With Rooms in Nottingham, which has two Michelin stars. We thought it would be a very special treat to celebrate our birthdays and 22nd wedding anniversary.
We were really looking forward to it, but unfortunately, just days before the reservation, I was struck with severe sciatica. It rendered me unable to sit, walk or drive.
