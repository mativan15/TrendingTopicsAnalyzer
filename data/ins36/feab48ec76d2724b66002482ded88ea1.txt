A day after the Gujarat government told the Supreme Court that it obtained "suitable orders" from the Centre for granting remission to the convicts in the Bikis Bano gang rape case, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging that while there was talk of respect for women from the Red Fort, but in reality, there was "support" for rapists. The Gujarat government on Monday had told the Supreme Court that petitioners challenging the remission given to 11 convicts in the Bilkis Bano gang rape case are nothing but an "interloper" and a "busybody".
