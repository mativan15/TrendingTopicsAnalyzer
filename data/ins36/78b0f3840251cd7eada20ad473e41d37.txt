Samoa must use the their opening disappointing defeat against England as motivation according to star man Jarome Luai.

Matt Parish's side helped kick-off the 2021 Rugby League World Cup in front of a crowd of 43,119 at St James' Park, Newcastle.

However, things didn't go as planned for the favourites, as England claimed an impressive 60-6 win on home soil in a dream start for Shaun Wane's men

Luai insisted his team-mates will use the 'sh**' losing feeling as a motivation, with Greece and France to play next respectively in the group stages.
