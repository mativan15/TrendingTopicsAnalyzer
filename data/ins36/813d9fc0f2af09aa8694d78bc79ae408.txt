PROVIDENCE — The Providence Police Department is getting two federal earmarks worth $2.275 million to buy new police cars and improve cyber- and physical security, US Senator Jack Reed said during a visit to the Public Safety Complex on Washington Street Thursday.'From rolling out new patrol vehicles to strengthening cyber security operations at the Providence Public Safety Complex, which serves as law enforcement's nerve center, this new funding will make a positive difference,' Reed said in a news release.
