HJBC/iStock Editorial via Getty Images TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE, OTCPK:TTFNF) is benefiting from the current price environment and underinvestment in oil and gas over the last years. The company intends to grow the dividend by 5% per year and a US$2Bn buyback was announced for 1H22. In light of the energy transition, the focus lies on growing the LNG and Renewables business while maintaining discipline with respect to capex spending. The forecasted dividend growth, share buybacks and current valuation make TotalEnergies a buy at the current level of US$59.
