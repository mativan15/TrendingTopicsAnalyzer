As the cost of buying food continues to soar, going vegetarian might be the last thing on your mind – after all, it's often deemed expensive. 
But if you've taken the (meat-free) bull by the horns and embraced October as Vegetarian Awareness Month, good for you. 
In fact, it could even save you money. Oxford University research has found that adopting a vegetarian, vegan or flexitarian diet could slash your food bill by up to a third. 
Of course, it's not always easy to stick to a plant-based diet, especially when you're starting to crave the taste and texture of meat.
