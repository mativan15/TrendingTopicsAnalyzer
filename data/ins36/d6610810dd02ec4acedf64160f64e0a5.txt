A 24-year-old Los Angeles woman is recovering from a traumatic brain injury after a homeless man stabbed her in the head with a pair of gardening shears in an unprovoked attack, authorities said.
Kyli Watts, 24, was walking along Lankershim Boulvard in North Hollywood around 11:30 a.m. Oct. 10 when the grisly assault took place, according to news station KTLA.
The suspected stabber, 30-year-old Johnathan Cole, rammed a pair of gardening shears with four-inch blades into the back of Watts's head as they passed while walking down the street, police said.
