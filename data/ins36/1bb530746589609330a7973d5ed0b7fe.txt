Just when we thought we'd have to wait until after Thanksgiving to get deep discounts on hot items, Target gave us a sweet surprise by quietly dropping Black Friday sales — in October.
 
Ahead of the ultimate sale season, Target is slashing prices on some must-have products, and right now you can save big on home and tech — from Apple AirPods to iRobot Roombas. Now's your chance to grab those items you might have missed from Amazon's second Prime Day sale.
 
The best part? Target will be adding new deals each week leading up to the real Black Friday, so you can start saving on top electronics today.
