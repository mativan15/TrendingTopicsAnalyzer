Experts have raised the alarm over Chinese makes of smart meters that can reportedly be remotely switched off, sparking blackouts fears. A quarter of a million Britons reportedly own smart meters made by a firm with connections to the Chinese Government, which experts say have the potential to "destroy" the national energy grid. Kaifa Technology UK is controlled by a subsidiary of the Beijing-owned China Electronics Corporation (CEC), and the firm has struck deals with at least three British energy companies.
