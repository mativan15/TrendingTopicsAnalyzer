Electrical power is mandatory for work and home - and it is Hurricane Season! Steven Cruise of Generator Super Center says he's dealing that every day. ""Business is booming! Everybody in the State of Texas knows all about ERCOT. Controlling your power supply is now more important than ever." Cruise continues to say his installation and repair crews are in constant demand and some customers are having to wait. "For the customer right now, lead times are backed up. ERCOT: High Temperatures this Weekend could Strain Power Grid We're at an all-time shortage of qualified licensed electricians and plumbers - like many other industries!" Cruise says beware of fly-by-night dealers.
