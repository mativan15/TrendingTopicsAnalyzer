The trio of candidates running for Indiana's U.S. Senate seat shared different ideas of what matters most to Hoosiers as they faced off Sunday in a debate — to date the only one scheduled before the Nov. 8 election.

Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Todd Young, Democratic candidate and Hammond Mayor Tom McDermott Jr., and Libertarian candidate James Sceniak shared their positions on abortion, inflation, immigration, Ukraine and other issues in the one-hour event broadcast locally by Lakeshore Public Media.
