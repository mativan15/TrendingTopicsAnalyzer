Published: 08:00 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 08:01 EDT, 20 October 2022 Britain has become the laughing stock of the world's media as Liz Truss's leadership goes 'from absurd to ridiculous' amid daily scenes of 'abject chaos' in parliament.Column inches from Australia to America, Ireland to India, and across mainland  Europe have been filled with mockery for both 'hopeless and hapless' Truss and a Tory party they said has been doomed 'by its own idiocy'. But the tone was far from cheerful. Many seemed deeply shocked that the British parliament, a 'temple of democracy and the oldest traditions', has been reduced to a 'circus' that one said risked turning the venerable UK into a 'Banana Republic'.
