So here is Mika Zibanejad, blazing-hot the way he was during the final six weeks of the 2019-20 season, when he scored 23 goals in the 22 games immediately preceding the pandemic pause, turning into one of hockey's ultimate shooters.
While scoring four goals in the Blueshirts' opening four games of this season, the elite center has been credited with 24 shots on net, but that's hardly the whole of it, with No. 93 unleashing 38 attempts, including 12 in the opener against Tampa Bay and 11 on Monday against Anaheim.
