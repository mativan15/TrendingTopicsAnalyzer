Mortgage rates reversed course, jolting up after as much as a week of declines.
 
The average rate offered for a conventional 30-year fixed mortgage climbed to 5.61% from 5.43% the previous business day, while the average 15-year rate shot up to 4.72% from 4.49% the previous business day. 
 
Rates have leveled off some since spiking in April to as high as 6.19% and 5.26%, respectively—the highest levels we'd seen since at least 2019 (and likely much farther back.) Even with the most recent jumps, both are still a good half percentage point below those April peaks.
