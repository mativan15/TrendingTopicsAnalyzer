Loose Women got very heated as they discussed politics earlier today. Amid concerns over Prime Minister Liz Truss and her recent apology to Tory MPs, Linda Robson took the opportunity to throw her support behind former Conservative Party leader Boris Johnson once again - making several comments that didn't go down well with co-star Coleen Nolan and those watching at home. Viewers of the ITV show claimed the Birds of a Feather actress 'hasn't got a clue' about politics and called for her to think about what she says on-air, as Linda recalled Johnson saying hello to her a few times when she bumped into him near her home.
