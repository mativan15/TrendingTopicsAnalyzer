Jun. 3—LEWISTON — College and university graduations are wrapping up, just as high schools in central Maine get ready to dismiss students for the summer. Tourist season is upon Maine, which means all the trappings that come along with summer fun and seasonal business are getting revved up.

Summer is also a traditional time for teens and college students to earn some extra money, but times are changing. Nationally, not enough of them are pursuing what used to be considered traditional summer jobs — like lifeguarding, working at an ice cream store, or a local camp.
