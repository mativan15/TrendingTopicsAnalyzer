New figures have revealed that the cost of building a home has jumped by a whopping $76,000, which means more construction firms will 'hit the wall'.

The cost of building a house skyrocketed by a record $76,715 in April as supply chain and labour shortages continued to bite, with alarm bells sounding that more construction firms will collapse in the coming months amid soaring prices making fixed price contracts unprofitable.

It comes as the number of construction companies going under this year has accelerated, with predictions that huge jumps in prices will not ease and are set to continue into the next financial year.
