The Oklahoma Sooners come into the NCAA tournament as one of the hottest teams in the country. Leading up to their Big 12 title run, the Sooners won five straight Big 12 series, including three on the road. Their wins over Texas Tech and TCU provided a lift for the Sooners and their tournament run helped them land a two seed in the Gainesville Regional.
