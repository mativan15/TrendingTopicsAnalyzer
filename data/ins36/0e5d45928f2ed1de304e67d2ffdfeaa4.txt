May 29—One of the biggest wind-energy projects in the world is being whipped up in Central New Mexico, a giant stride for the state's role in renewable energy.

The overseer of the project, Pattern Energy, already has completed a New Mexico project called Western Spirit that will provide electricity to Los Angeles, San Jose and other California cities. Pattern Energy has scheduled a bigger New Mexico project, called SunZia, for completion in early 2026.

Proponents say the potential for wind-aided power could generate a profound shift in New Mexico, allowing two things it possesses in abundance — endless gusts and huge stretches of empty land — to be widely used to create energy and make money.
