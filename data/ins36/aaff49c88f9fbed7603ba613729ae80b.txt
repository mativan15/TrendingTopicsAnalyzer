Can Britain go on like this? Can Britain, in other words, continue to be governed by an increasingly chaotic administration that is never far from collapse, and lacks democratic support?At the time of writing, the UK has an unelected prime minister, Liz Truss, who was recently installed by a tiny cabal of activists. But she has already ceded much of her power to another, de facto prime minister – Jeremy Hunt – who is in charge of economic policy and the bulk of the government's domestic agenda. Can this be right? Certainly, it is striking that Mr Hunt, who came last in the Conservative leadership election – with all of 18 votes from his fellow MPs – should now have leapfrogged the many others who outperformed him in the hustings, and be running the country.
