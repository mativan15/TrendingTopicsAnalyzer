Even as cities across British Columbia saw sweeping change in terms of who leads their councils, one thing stayed the same as the last municipal election — voter turnout continued to lag far behind provincial and federal votes.As of 3 p.m. PT on Sunday, based on preliminary results, just over 37 per cent of voters turned out to elect local representatives. It's a number that's a few percentage points lower than four years ago, but continues to mirror a trend that holds true across Canada.So why aren't people voting in local elections? And how did essentially the same level of political participation result in markedly different city halls on Saturday?"For the more casual voter, who might turn out for a provincial or certainly a federal election, the municipal level is seen as a utility," said David Black, who teaches political communication at Royal Roads University in Victoria.
