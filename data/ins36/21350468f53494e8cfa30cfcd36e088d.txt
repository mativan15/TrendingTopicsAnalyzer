May 29—EAU CLAIRE — Helping to fill the new downtown transfer center funding gap, drilling a new well and creating affordable housing are among ways the city is proposing to use its share of federal COVID-19 recovery funds.

Earlier this month City Manger Stephanie Hirsch presented her proposal for how the city could use $13.5 million coming from the American Recovery Plan Act.

"The ARPA funding will make a large one-time investment that we hope will be transformative," Hirsch said.

The proposal includes addressing some funding gaps in Eau Claire that became prominent during the pandemic, but also projects for issues identified by resident surveys and the City Council.
