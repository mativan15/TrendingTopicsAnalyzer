Feds plan safe opioid supply, Sept. 29

Carolyn Bennett, minister of Mental Health and Addiction, has proposed a regulated supply of free drugs to addicts, in the hope of stemming the tide of deaths by drug overdose.

Providing drugs freely to addicts does more harm than good.

It does not deal with the main driving force for their addiction, such as poverty, mental and physical illness, which causes despair and hopelessness.

People who are addicted to drugs lose their human dignity, become malnourished, and have a pervasive lack of self-esteem, and become homeless as a result of their continued drug use.
