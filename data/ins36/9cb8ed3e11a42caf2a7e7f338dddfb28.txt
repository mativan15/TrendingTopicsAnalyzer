Germany has been forced to nationalise gas importer Uniper, pumping about $29bn into the company. The Danish, Finnish and Swedish governments are also guaranteeing lending for collateral, in schemes worth about $10-$24bn each.
Under the UK's scheme, the Bank of England will provide a 100pc guarantee on 'additional lending' to energy firms, over and above the usual loans they get from banks. 
It will be designed to be used for short-term, last-resort support, the Bank says, aimed at helping energy firms 'manage risk in a cost-effective way'.
