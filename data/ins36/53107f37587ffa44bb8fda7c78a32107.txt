Vito Maggio, who has always enjoyed Windsor's downtown, is set to open up shop there in the near future. 'I'm very excited to go downtown and make this happen,' he said. Maggio is not moving any of his current restaurants away from Walkerville but he is going to fill a vacant building with activity. He bought the old City Grill late last year. 'When that opportunity came up that I could purchase it I was really excited to keep on growing,' he said. He hasn't committed to a business model but has a lot of ideas.
