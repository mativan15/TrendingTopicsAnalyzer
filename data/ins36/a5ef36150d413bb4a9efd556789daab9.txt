WASHINGTON – An advocacy group with conservative ties is grabbing voters' attention with a variety of billboards and newspaper ads mocking ideas supported by some progressives.The group, known as Citizens for Sanity, has launched the messaging campaign in multiple battleground states.The ads have featured phrases like "Help Charlie become Charlotte," "Mother Nature is Racist" and "Violent Criminals Deserve Our Respect.""The idea is to take some of these more insane things from the far woke left and just bluntly putting it out there," said Ian Prior, a strategic adviser with the group.
