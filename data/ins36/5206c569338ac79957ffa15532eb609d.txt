Small and Medium Enterprises' (SMEs) impact on economic growth is widely acknowledged. Nevertheless, the literature lacks empirical evidence as to how the sustainable performance of manufacturing SMEs in developing countries with unstable and turbulent business environments, such as Palestine, could be enhanced. Relying on the Triple Bottom Line (TBL), Resource-based View (RBV) theory, and sustainable performance literature, this study explores the influence of systematic strategic planning (SSP) and strategic business innovation (SBI) on the sustainable performance (SP) of Palestinian manufacturing SMEs.
