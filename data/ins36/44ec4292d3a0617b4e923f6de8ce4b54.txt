Farmers have criticized a plan that could see them pay for greenhouse gas emissions produced by their livestock. The government says it is in talks with farmers over the proposed tax.Farmers gathered across New Zealand on Thursday to protest a controversial government proposal to tax livestock emissions. The levy, which is still in the consultation phase, would be on methane and nitrous oxide emissions produced by New Zealand's livestock population of six million cows and 26 million sheep. The government announced the plan last week in a "world's first" bid to combat climate change and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
