6:00 AM ETPHILADELPHIA -- The timing could have been better for new Philadelphia Eagles cornerback James Bradberry.Needing to shed salary, the New York Giants entered the offseason looking to trade Bradberry, who had been one of the team's most productive players over the past two seasons with seven interceptions and 25 pass breakups. There was interest in the Pro Bowl defensive back, but talks with multiple teams never crossed the finish line. So the Giants held onto him through free agency and the draft before finally releasing him on May 9.
