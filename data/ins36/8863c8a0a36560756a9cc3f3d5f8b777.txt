New Zealand golfer Steven Alker shot a sizzling final round to win the second major of the year on the PGA Tour Champions. Alker fired in nine birdies on his way to a stunning 63 and victory at the Senior PGA Championship at the Harbor Shores Golf Club in Michigan on Monday (NZT). That saw him haul in overnight leader Stephen Ames of Canada to finish the tournament at 16-under for a three-shot win and the biggest victory of his reborn career in the over-50s scene. The title earned Alker just over $964,000 and kept him top of the tour's prize money list.
