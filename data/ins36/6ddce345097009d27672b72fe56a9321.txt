Aviad Gabbai, 42, a Kiryat Malachi resident, returned to AMIT Kiryat Malachi, where he once studied and has served as principal for the past two years. 'At the beginning, I felt strange,' he says. 'But I came with a mission to show each boy and girl that from the desk they are sitting at as students, they can go far, all the way to the principal's office and beyond.'

Nurit Davidi graduated from the AMIT Dyckman Ulpana in Be'er Sheva 30 years ago, and after working as a teacher in her hometown of Sderot (Nurit is the wife of Sderot's mayor, Alon Davidi) and the Director of Informal Education at the AMIT Network, she decided to return to the school – this time as the principal.
