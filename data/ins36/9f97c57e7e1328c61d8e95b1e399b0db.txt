It turns out that 2022 will be the year of at least three UK prime ministers, with Liz Truss resigning on Oct. 20 following calls from her own party to step down. This would have been no surprise to the UK tabloid the Daily Star, which had been predicting Truss's downfall in the meanest way.

On Oct. 14, the Daily Star demonstrated its belief that Truss wouldn't last by setting up a live video feed trained on a head of lettuce, accompanied by the title 'Can Liz Truss outlast a lettuce?' Gradually, the lettuce, adorned with a set of fake eyes to enhance its anthropomorphic look, was joined by various other props meant to keep the surprising number of lettuce watchers engaged.
