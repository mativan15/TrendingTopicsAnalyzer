Kelly Scheib knows a thing or two—or eight—about parental leave. 'I like to say there are eight babies out there who call me momma,' the newly appointed chief people officer of Crunchbase—the first to fill the role—tells Fortune. Scheib, 39, has cared for a lot of children—three biological kids and five foster kids (two of which she's since adopted). Naturally, that experience has also shaped her career. Foster care and adoption weren't always a priority for Scheib, but after learning about a genetic predisposition that put her family at higher risk of cancer (her brother died in 2019 at 37 years old from pancreatic cancer), she and her husband decided they'd have to take a different route if they wanted to add to their family.
