Last May, the Nigerian Presidency launched the Nigeria Startup Bill in collaboration with a group of Nigerian tech leaders and several government bodies to govern how startups and regulatory bodies operate and collaborate in the multi-billion-dollar tech ecosystem.
Today, that bill has been signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari. This news was made known via a tweet by Isa Pantami, the country's minister of Communications & Digital Economy. He also mentioned that the bill, now called the Nigeria Start-Up Act, was initiated by his office and the country's Office of the Chief of Staff.
