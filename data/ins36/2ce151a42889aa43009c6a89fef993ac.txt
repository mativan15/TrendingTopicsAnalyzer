London-based physicist Jessica Wade has won the praise of netizens for her feat. Wade, who works for gender equality in STEM, has written more than 1,600 Wikipedia entries for women scientists who have been ignored for a long time. Good News Movement said in a tweet Wade, 33, has received an invitation to Buckingham Palace to receive the British Empire Medal and a citation from Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales.
According to an NBC report, Wade began writing about women scientists who were not paid by their employers, other scientists and the public when she was in her 20s.
