When organizers at South Korean entertainment company KAMP Global announced in August that they were bringing a star-studded K-pop festival stateside, it almost seemed too good to be true. However, upon revealing KAMP LA's lineup, confirming a diverse array of A-level talent such as Taeyeon, Monsta X, Kai, Momoland, BamBam, and more, the mega-concert that looked like a K-pop stan's fantasy became real. With fans around the country flocking to the Golden State, KAMP LA 2022 took over Pasadena's Rose Bowl stadium from October 15–16 for two days of energetic performances, comeback teasers, and community building.
