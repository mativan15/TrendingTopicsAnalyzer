If you'd rather stay home on Black Friday to continue to digest your Thanksgiving meal instead of braving the raucous crowds that flood every single retail establishment in your general area, the NFL has your back.

In 2023, Amazon Prime will broadcast the NFL's first-ever Black Friday game, which is scheduled for Friday, Nov. 24 (the day after Thanksgiving) with an estimated kickoff of 3pm ET.

"Thanksgiving is synonymous with football, and we're excited to give our fans another day of NFL action during this holiday weekend," said Hans Schroeder, chief operating officer for NFL Media, in a statement.
