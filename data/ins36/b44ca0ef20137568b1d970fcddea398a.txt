Sir Keir Starmer has condemned the ‘grotesque chaos' of Liz Truss sacking former chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng.
Ms Truss, forced to fire her closest ally and reverse yet another key economic policy, is now ‘clinging' to Number 10, he said.
Speaking at the regional Labour Party conference in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, Sir Keir said the Tory government's financial policies have proved deeply ‘damaging'.
‘We can't take irresponsible risks with the country's finances, we must be the party of sound money,' Sir Keir said this morning.
