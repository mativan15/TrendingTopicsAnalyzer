Fred Sirieix has weighed in on the James Corden restaurant complaint saga, after the Late Late Show host was ‘banned' from a diner in America.
The Gavin and Stacey star made headlines after he was banned from Balthazar, in New York, amid allegations that he was ‘nasty' to waiting staff.
In response, James issued an apology, but then insisted he hadn't done ‘anything wrong' on ‘any level.
