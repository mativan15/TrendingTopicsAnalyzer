Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Lourdes Gurriel Jr. has had successful surgery on his left wrist.

The club confirmed that the 29-year-old Gurriel had the procedure on Thursday.

Gurriel missed the last few weeks of Toronto's regular season as well as the Blue Jays' two-game wild-card loss to the Seattle Mariners with an injured hamstring.

A team spokesman said that the right-handed Gurriel had had issues with his left wrist throughout the season.

It was decided after Toronto's elimination from the post-season on Oct.
