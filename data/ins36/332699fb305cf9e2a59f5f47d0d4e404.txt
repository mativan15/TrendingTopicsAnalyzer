Mental health advocate Jazz Thornton began this season of Dancing with the Stars with just one term of high school dance experience under her belt.

It took ten weeks of effort, hours and hours of practice, learning to move her hips and avoiding Covid-19 – but last night the founder of Voices of Hope was crowned the season nine winner.

'I am the complete opposite to sexy shake your hips kind of person,' she told Stuff the morning after her win, on the back of no sleep, still fizzing with the 'surreal' win.
