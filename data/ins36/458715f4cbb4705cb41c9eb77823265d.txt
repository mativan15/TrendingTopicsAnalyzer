If, as is now all but certain, Reece Topley is ruled out of the T20 World Cup in its entirety, the likely beneficiary will be Tymal Mills, who is as near a like-for-like replacement as there is at England's disposal. There are other left-armers in the squad already, but neither Sam Curran nor David Willey has the same sort of pace as these two.Topley rolled his ankle on the boundary rope during fielding drills before the warm-up match against Pakistan in Brisbane on Monday. The squad has since moved to Perth, where they will take on Afghanistan in their opening group game at the Optus Stadium on Saturday.
