Sheryl Sandberg, the COO of Meta Platforms, is resigning after 14 years of running the company alongside Mark Zuckerberg. It was 'time to write the next chapter of my life', she said in a 1,542-word post on Facebook accompanied by effusive comments from her fellow executives at the company.Her departure had been anticipated for some time. An investigation last year by the Wall Street Journal analysing internal Facebook data found that the percentage of staff reporting to Sandberg, 52, had been shrinking in recent years.
