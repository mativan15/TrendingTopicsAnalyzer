JERUSALEM — Israel reacted with fury Tuesday to Australia's announcement that it will no longer recognize West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing a controversial diplomatic move made four years ago by the previous conservative government.Israel's Foreign Ministry summoned the Australian ambassador Tuesday to explain the policy shift, which was announced after two days of contradictory messages on the issue from Canberra. Only hours after officials denied that the change was imminent, Foreign Minister Penny Wong confirmed that Australia would not move its embassy to the Jerusalem until Israelis and Palestinians came to a permanent agreement on the disputed capital.
