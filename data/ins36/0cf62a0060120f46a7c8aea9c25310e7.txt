Dhananjaya's role as Daali in Tagaru gave him a cult status as a gangster. But having donned different avatars after that, he is back as his fans' favourite – as gangster for Head Bush. As Head Bush releases in theatres today, he chats with Bangalore Times about how he manages to find that fine balance, between Daali productions that presents this film, his life as a producer and actor, about a gamble called life and more... 
Ten releases in two years in several shades and pivotal roles. Do you need to work on the balance? I do some films for the fans, some for the soul, some for the actor in me.
