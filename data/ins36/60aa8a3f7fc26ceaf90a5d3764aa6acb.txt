For 22 years Denzil Minnan Wong was the voice of Don Valley East on city council, regularly racking up double digit victories on election nights. But the longtime city councillor and current deputy mayor is one of seven incumbents who have chosen not to run in this election. That, in turn, has created a rare open race in a part of the city not typically accustomed to them. There are a total of 11 candidates vying to be elected in Don Valley East as a result, making it the fourth most crowded ballot across Toronto's 25 wards.
