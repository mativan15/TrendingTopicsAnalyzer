Kenichi Horie, dubbed 'Japan's most famous yachtsman', has become the oldest person in the world to complete a solo, non-stop voyage across the Pacific Ocean, aged 83.

His journey began at a yacht harbour in San Francisco on 27 March and Mr Horie returned home on Saturday as he crossed the Kii Strait off Japan's western coast at around 2.39am local time – completing his journey in 69 days.

After spending the night in his customised, 19-foot-long Suntory Mermaid III, Mr Horie was towed into his home port of Shin Nhishinomiya on Sunday.
