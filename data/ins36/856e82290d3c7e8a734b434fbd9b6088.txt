'Growing a business is like completing a jigsaw puzzle and if you miss out one piece, you'll come up short,' says Alok Goel, the co-founder and CEO of Drivetrain. Goel and his team claim that Drivetrain, which is today announcing a $15 million funding round, will help businesses avoid falling into that trap – and therefore to complete the picture and fulfill their potential. Drivetrain is a cloud-based software-as-a-service application designed to make it easier for businesses to plan their execution strategies and to monitor their performance against their targets.
