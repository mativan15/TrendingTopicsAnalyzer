CNN —

Former world No. 1 Simona Halep has been provisionally suspended from tennis after testing positive for a prohibited substance at this year's US Open.

According to the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), Halep tested positive for Roxadustat, which is a banned substance listed in the 2022 World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List.

The two-time grand slam champion has denied knowingly taking the banned substance.

'Today begins the hardest match of my life: a fight for the truth,' the 31-year-old said in a statement on social media Friday.
