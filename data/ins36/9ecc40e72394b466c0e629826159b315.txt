The BJP Sunday accused the AAP of doing 'pressure politics' following the CBI's summons to Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia for questioning in connection with its investigation into the excise policy.
BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia, at a press conference, said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was the 'kingpin' of scams his ministers are accused of. 'These days, Kejriwal compares himself to god and his ministers to freedom fighters. Kejriwal should be ashamed as his corrupt ministers are filling his coffers while Bhagat Singh sacrificed his life for the country,' Bhatia alleged.
