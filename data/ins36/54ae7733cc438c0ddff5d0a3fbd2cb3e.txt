Seeking the help of non-resident Gujaratis (NRGs) in the upcoming Assembly elections in Gujarat, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ushered in an era of 'politics of performance' by eliminating appeasement, casteism and dynastic politics.
'The biggest work done by Narendrabhai was to give a platform for the talented in the democratic setup. Those who have the ability were given a platform. Narendrabhai rooted out parivarvad (dynasty politics), jaativad (caste politics) and tustikaran (appeasement) from the country and started an era of politics of performance.
