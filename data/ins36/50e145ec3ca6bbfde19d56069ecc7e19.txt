By Ed Frankl Rational AG said Friday that it would suspend its business operations in Russia and close its distribution company based in Moscow by the end of 2022. The German oven manufacturer said the decision came in response to economic and political developments from the war in Ukraine. "Our withdrawal from the Russian market will happen gradually and in an orderly manner, so that we can meet our existing obligations to our local customers and partners as effectively as possible," Rational Chief Executive Peter Stadelmann said in a statement.
