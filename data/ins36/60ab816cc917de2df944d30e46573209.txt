Mumbai: The Supreme Court on Friday approved a loan settlement offer given by Siva Industries promoters, while quashing a liquidation order passed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and upheld by the appellate authority. Siva group founder C Sivasankaran's father, RCK Vallal, offered the settlement under Section 12A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, which enables lenders to seek NCLT approval to withdraw their petition for corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) provided 90% of them agree to the proposal.
