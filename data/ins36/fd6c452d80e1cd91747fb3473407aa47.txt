Kanye West is stirring up more controversy with part three of his interview on Drinks Champs. The 45-year-old fashion mogul and rapper, who now goes by Ye, spoke with hosts N.O.R.E. and DJ EFN about numerous topics during the nearly 45-minute conversation, including his theories about George Floyd's death, how Jewish people control media and entertainment, Drake‘s success in hip-hop, and much more. Ye, who recently attended the premiere of conservative commentator Candace Owens' new film, The Greatest Lie Ever Sold: George Floyd and the Rise of BLM, said he believes Floyd's death was caused by fentanyl and not by suffocation from a police officer's knee.
