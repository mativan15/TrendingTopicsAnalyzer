Credit rating agencies are right to seek the intervention of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to resolve the confusion following the Reserve Bank of India 's (RBI) new, stringent directive on ratings given on corporate loans. The directive says ratings on such loans can't be notched up based on 'guarantees' and 'letters of comfort' to help group companies raise money and bargain a lower interest rate on the back of such support from parent companies. However, Sebi's existing directive allows all these supports to lift the rating for non-convertible debentures.
