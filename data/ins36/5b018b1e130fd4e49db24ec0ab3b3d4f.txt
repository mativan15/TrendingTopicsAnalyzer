A cryptocurrency crash could have repurcussions well beyond crypto itself. Contagion could spread to the fixed-income market, and then to other financial markets as well.That's the investment implication of a new study out of Yale University that began circulating in academic circles earlier this month. Entitled 'How the cryptocurrency market is connected to the financial market,' the study was conducted by Sang Rae Kim, a doctoral candidate in Yale's economics department. The study's findings are surprising, since there was no obvious contagion in early May from the collapse of TerraUSD USTUSD, -17.
