REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File PhotoSwiss financial services firm UBS will increase India-based senior positions, as it moves to make the country a core technology hub, a top executive said. At present, about 36% of the digital and information group workforce is based out of India, driving a large part of technology development for the bank.

'We will be moving roles and looking to retain, promote and hire 7-10 managing directors in the next year or two, making sure that India is one of our core hubs,' Mike Dargan, chief digital and information officer, UBS Group AG, told ET.
