British equities have outperformed those in Europe in recent months and there is more to come, according to one of the City's most influential brokers.Strategists at Morgan Stanley told clients yesterday to stay positive on the UK stock market, which has already enjoyed a boost from improving investor sentiment.'We remain buyers of the FTSE 100, where valuations remain low,' they said.'Strong price action, coupled with broadly neutral earnings revisions, has driven a sharp re-rating for UK equities', which means the British market 'is now back at pre-Covid levels in absolute terms', they noted.
