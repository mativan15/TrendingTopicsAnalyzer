John Bel Edwards and Democratic Congressman Troy Carter announced on Wednesday a $35 million project to stop the erosion. About a fifth of the money will come from the Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service, courtesy of the recent infrastructure act. Construction of a small dam is scheduled to start in fall 2024 and be completed in two years.
