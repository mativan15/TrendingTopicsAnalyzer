For those looking for an opportunity to catch their breath, there's no respite in college football as it enters the second half of this already unpredictable season. Week 8 brings another full schedule of quality games seven days after No. 1 Alabama fell, as did three other unbeatens in the top 10.

The headliner Saturday comes in the Pac-12 with No. 9 Oregon hosting No. 10 UCLA. The Bruins have played five of their six games at home, making this trip to Autzen Stadium dangerous. Both teams are unbeaten in conference play, which provides the opportunity for the winner to be in great shape to make the league's championship game.
