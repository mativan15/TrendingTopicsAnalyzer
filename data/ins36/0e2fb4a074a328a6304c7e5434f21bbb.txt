Bitcoin has been through two clear 'halving' cycles in its short existence, from 2012–2016 and 2016–2020 (epochs 2 and 3 on the chart below). We ignore the first epoch because the asset was too young and wild (even for it) to be of any use. These cycles are book-ended by the 4-year 'halvings', when the supply of newly minted bitcoins coming into the market halves. According to ByteTree Terminal data, the next halving is due on the 9th April 2024. This is now only 18 months away, which in market terms means it is time to sit up and pay attention.
