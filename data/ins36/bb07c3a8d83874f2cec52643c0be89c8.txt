BlackBerry Ltd's US$600-million patent sale announced in January has hit a snag.The Waterloo, Ont. company said in a release Wednesday it is no longer under exclusivity with Catapult IP Innovations Inc., a US special purpose entity formed to buy the assets, 'given the length of time that the transaction has taken.' BlackBerry BB-T 'is exploring alternative options in parallel' as Catapult 'continues to work on securing its required financing,' the Canadian company said.The deal, which passed a federal government review under the Investment Act, has been in the works since 2020.
