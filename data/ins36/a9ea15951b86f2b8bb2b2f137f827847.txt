Farmers have opposed the railway's move to establish a private freight terminal (PFT) at Perundurai by acquiring 30.50 acre of farm lands and wanted the terminal to be established near Vijayamangalam railway station where the railway owns 70 acres. Under the ‘Gati Shakti Multi-Modal Cargo Terminal (GCT)' policy of the Central government that aims to boost investment from industry in development of additional terminals for handling rail cargos, the railways had permitted Legacy Warehouse and Logistics Private Limited to establish a terminal at Thulukampalayam village located between Ingur and Vijayamangalam railway stations in Perundurai taluk.
