A developer has told the city it faces a unique obstacle on reporting jobs pledged for a property tax break in the Short North – even though the building is full and has created jobs.

Crawford Hoying is among three developers recommended for warning letters after an annual review of the city's property tax incentives, saying their abatements could be dissolved if they don't comply with reporting requirements or submit a plan within 60 days for attaining their hiring goals.

The developer hasn't been able to provide jobs data for WeWork's Columbus location at 800 N.
