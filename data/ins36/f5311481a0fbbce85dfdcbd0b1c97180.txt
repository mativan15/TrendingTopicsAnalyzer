For the third time, Chip Kelly is going back to the scene of his greatest success, the place where he revolutionized the fabric of college football with dizzying offenses and kitschy uniforms.

For the first time, fans inside Autzen Stadium might feel like they're seeing the same guy they remember.

His team is unbeaten. His offense is so good that it's almost a shock when it doesn't score. His defense reliably gets enough stops.

It's the sort of thing that the man who vaulted Kelly into the national spotlight at Oregon always thought would happen for his protégé at UCLA, if a bit sooner than Year 5.
