Whoopi Goldberg turned viewers' stomachs after she revealed that she and her daughter openly discuss their bowel movements. The View panellist was discussing family life with guest John Stamos when she admitted that she and her 48-year-old daughter Alex "still talk about poop". John said how his son "says poop a lot", and Whoopi replied: "That's my kind of guy." "No matter what age. Mine's 48 and she and I still talk poop," she said. According to Whoopi's granddaughter Amara, the Sister Act star got her nickname because of her habit of openly letting rip.
