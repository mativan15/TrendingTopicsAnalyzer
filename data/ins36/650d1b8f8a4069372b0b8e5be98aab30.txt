In 2022, every company is expected to have a diversity and inclusion strategy. The murder of George Floyd has catapulted corporate DEI commitments into the public spotlight. Many companies have made bold statements on diversity and inclusion in response to consumer demand. And now they have to deliver. There is nowhere to hide. Gen-Z is the most racially and ethnically diverse generation in U.S. history. More than 48% are non-white. In the U.K., 40% of the population is estimated to be non-white by 2061.
