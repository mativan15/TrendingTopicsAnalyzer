Israel-based Ayala Pharmaceuticals, which has its U.S. headquarters in Wilmington, entered into a merger agreement Wednesday with Advaxis Inc. in what would be a union of two companies focused on developing therapies targeting cancer.

The proposed all-stock deal calls for Ayala (NASDAQ: AYLA) shareholders to own 62.5% of the combined company and shareholders of Monmouth Junction, New Jersey-based Advaxis (OTCQX: ADXS) to own the remaining 32.5%. Executives of Advaxis will lead the combined company, which will be based in New Jersey and have offices in Israel where the majority of Ayala's 35 employees are based.
