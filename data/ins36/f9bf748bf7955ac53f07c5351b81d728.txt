Texas sued Google on Thursday for allegedly collecting residents' facial and voice data without their consent — and accused the tech giant of turning millions of everyday Texans into 'unwitting cash cows being milked by Google for profits.' 
State attorney general Ken Paxton alleged in the suit that Google violated a state law that bars companies from collecting people's faces, voices, fingerprints and other biometric information without their explicit consent. 
'Google has, since at least 2015, collected biometric data from innumerable Texans and used their faces and their voices to serve Google's commercial ends,' Paxton wrote in the suit.
