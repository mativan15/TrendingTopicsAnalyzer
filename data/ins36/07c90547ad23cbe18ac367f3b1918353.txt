Texas wide receiver Jordan Whittington has suffered from injury after injury over the course of his college career. The senior has been limited to just 13 games throughout his first three years at Texas.
Whittington has finally been able to stay on the field in 2022 and is taking advantage of his opportunity. He has snagged 28 passes for 381 yards on the season. Whittington got into the endzone for the first time in the year against Iowa State last Saturday.
