There are a ton of great shows to see this weekend in Bay Area. Here is a partial rundown.
Trolley Dances are back
Epiphany Dance Theatre is bringing its quirky and impressive gift to the Bay Area — the San Francisco Trolley Dances — back for its 19th rendition.
The concept is simple: Catch a trolley car ride and along the way you'll be delighted by short performances from of the city's most talented dancers at designated stops. Led by Epiphany artistic director Kim Epifano and managing director Zoë Klein, this year's trolley car special dance route runs from South of Market to Chinatown along the city's new Muni T-Line extension.
