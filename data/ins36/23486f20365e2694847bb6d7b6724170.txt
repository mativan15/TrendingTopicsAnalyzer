While the Centre is pushing for booster shots, Mumbai's Covishield stock will last for only seven more days. Vaccination centres are being advised to offer Corbevax as a heterogeneous Covid booster dose but beneficiaries are not keen on mixing vaccines.
At present, Mumbai has only 2,000 vials of Covisheild left at six to seven vaccination centres. With the flattening of the pandemic curve, the demand for doses has dropped but those who want to take the shot are returning from vaccination centres without taking the jab due to shortage of Covishield vials.
