Capital One rounds out the list of the 10 largest US banks based on assets, according to a Federal Reserve's 2022 ranking. It offers a set of deposit accounts that provide solid services for retail banking customers including certificates of deposit and youth accounts. Capital One offers innovative banking experiences, marrying digital banking services with physical locations in select cities, and airports, across the country. The Capital One Cafés, for example, offer a unique experience compared to traditional bank branches by providing both clients, and the general public, with free Wi-Fi, comfortable lounge seating and Peet's coffee and treats.
