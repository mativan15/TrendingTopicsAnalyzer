The Winnipeg Jets will be without forward Nikolaj Ehlers for a little longer.
It was a travel day for the team after getting a reality check on Thursday in losing to the Vegas Golden Knights to close out the three-game road trip, but Ehlers will not be in the lineup when the Jets host the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday.The Jets placed the slick skating forward on injured reserve on Friday with an undisclosed injury. Ehlers missed the last two games of the trip.Ehlers has to spend a minimum of seven days on the injured list, and the move is retroactive to October 18, so he'll definitely be sitting out both games on the upcoming homestand.
