ASX-listed co-working space operator Victory Offices has confirmed the closure of all of its Sydney city locations and lost its chief financial officer, as the ailing business looks to find its feet after falling out with its landlords.

In a trading update issued before its shares were put in a trading halt, Victory said the 'decision to exit is expected to have a positive impact on the recovery of the company's portfolio of office locations', given that the Sydney CBD locations were likely to continue to operate at a loss for some time in the future.
