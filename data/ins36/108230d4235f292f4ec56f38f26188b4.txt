The Cabinet is expected to approve a ban on new evictions lasting until next March when it meets this morning despite misgivings about the measure among some in Fine Gael.Once Ministers give the go ahead, the Government will introduce legislation in the Oireachtas, which it aims to pass before the end of this month.However, it is expected that the eviction ban will not extend to tenants who refuse to pay rent or misuse a property and that existing notices to quit will still be enforceable.Sources with knowledge of discussions in Government said the advice of the Attorney General was that a complete ban, or an indefinite halt to evictions, would be open to a successful legal challenge.
