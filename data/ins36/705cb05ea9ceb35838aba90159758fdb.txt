Petroleum dealers across Telangana will not purchase petrol and diesel, from the national oil marketing companies they represent, on May 31 in support of demand for higher commission and a mechanism that safeguards them whenever Excise duty on fuel is reduced. Customers, however, will not be impacted as dealers will cater to them with existing stocks, Telangana Petroleum Dealers Association (TPDA) president M. Amarender Reddy said. There are around 3,500 petroleum dealers, of the three OMCs namely Indian Oil Corporation, BPCL and HPCL, in the State and they purchase around 90 lakh litres of fuel daily.
