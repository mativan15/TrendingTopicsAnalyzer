Willem Marx: Our camp guide is Nasuri Saidu, a former fisherman from a landscape of lakes now forced to rely on rations from the World Food Program.He introduces us to Yagana Ali Abakar, a mother of nine from Nigeria working to establish herself here as a seamstress. It's very much a family business, but it's far from booming. Even the sewing machine is rented. She owns almost nothing.So, this is a UNHCR-supplied house. And inside, I can see some mats, some clothes, some blankets, one small table, and a single earthenware pot.
