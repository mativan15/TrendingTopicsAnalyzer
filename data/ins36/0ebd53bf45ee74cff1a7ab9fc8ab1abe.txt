The new member of Chillicothe Council is offering open office hours on third Mondays, starting today, October 17th, 2022. Jamie Brown attended his first council session last Monday to represent the 6th ward, which includes his home street of Douglas Avenue. In a Facebook post, he wrote that you can come in and have a quick chat, ask questions, or let him know what issues you think are crucial to Chillicothe and Ross County. Brown's open office will be 4:30 to 6pm today in the Chillicothe-Ross County Public Library Annex, behind the main library building at 140 South Paint Street, in Room D.
