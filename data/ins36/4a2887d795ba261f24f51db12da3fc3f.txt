Strictly Come Dancing star Matt Goss, who has a rare muscle condition, has opened up about how the BBC's juggernaut show is helping improve his strength and body confidence.
The Bros frontman is paired up with Nadiya Bychkova on dancing competition series, vying to impress judges Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Shirley Ballas and Anton Du Beke.
While the pair have landed at the bottom end of the leaderboard twice, and narrowly avoided being eliminated in the second week, the performer said the long-running show has done wonders for his self-esteem.
