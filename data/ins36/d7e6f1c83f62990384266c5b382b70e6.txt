Residents and community organizations in Laval say urgent actions need to be taken to deal with the rise in gun violence this summer.Many say they're feeling shaken after the shooting this Wednesday at a restaurant in the city's Vimont neighbourhood that led to the death of a 42-year-old man. Last month the city also saw three shootings within the span of three days."The kids are scared. They're scared to come out, they're scared to play, scared to do things," said Rodney Dorvelus, a community worker at the Bureau de consultation jeunesse, a community centre that focuses on strengthening young people's autonomy.
