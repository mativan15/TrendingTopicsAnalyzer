LUCKNOW: As the discussion on the governor's address ahead of the UP budget drew to a close in the Vidhan Parishad on Friday, members from the opposition and ruling party sparred over the achievements of the BJP government listed out by the governor.

Where the Samajwadi Party MLCs attempted to talk about the government's failures, BJP members hit out at SP and Congress, taking potshots at senior leaders like Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi.
