It's amazing how the perception of a program can change in a year. Notre Dame wasn't on anyone's radar at the beginning of last season. Now, college basketball fans have to at least consider the possibility that the Irish will make noise in 2022-23. That's because the AP has come out with its preseason poll, and the Irish were one of five programs to receive exactly one vote.
As typically is the case, the Irish will have to prove themselves against some quality ACC competition. North Carolina, last year's national runner-up, is the top-ranked team in this poll.
