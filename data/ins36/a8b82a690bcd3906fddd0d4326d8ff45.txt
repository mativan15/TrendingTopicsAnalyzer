Newest Boston Celtics forward Justin Jackson spoke to the media after his first practice with the team after having officially made the Celtics' regular roster for the 2022-23 NBA season. 'It's a blessing for sure,' said the Houston native of making the team after a bit of a tough start in Boston's earlier preseason games.
'(I'm) definitely looking forward to coming to an already great team, an already great historical organization, and just learning as much I can and contributing in whatever ways I can possibly contribute,' added Jackson, whose 16-point, 4-rebound game against the Charlotte Hornets on Oct.
