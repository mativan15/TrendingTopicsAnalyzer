chandigarh@hindustantimes.com The UT administration will continue to provide MBBS admissions at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, as per the new eligibility criteria for wards of defence personnel that removed all exemptions for them under the 'UT pool' category, as the Supreme Court dismissed the plea against the move on Friday. UT's new criteria benefit only those wards of defence personnel who had permanent residence in Chandigarh at the time of entry into service. The plea by Ananya Goswami, the daughter of a serving Colonel, was dismissed by the SC bench headed by justice Dr DY Chandrachud and justice Hima Kohli.
