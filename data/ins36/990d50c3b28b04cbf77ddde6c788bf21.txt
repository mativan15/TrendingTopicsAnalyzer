Some will tell you that people don't change, but current science tends to disagree. A person's personality can change naturally over time, or deliberately with effort. It can also change collectively, apparently, thanks to a global health crisis.

New research published in PLOS One reported that American adults experienced changes in their personalities over the COVID-19 pandemic. The changes were small but equivalent to around a decade's worth of personality changes in only two years.

The researchers analyzed data from 7,109 adults, aged 18 to 109, enrolled in the Understanding America Study.
