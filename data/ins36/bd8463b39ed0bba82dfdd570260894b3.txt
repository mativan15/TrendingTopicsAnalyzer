The oilseeds industry has urged the government to increase the import duty on all kinds of oils after Diwali. It expressed the apprehension that prices of oilseeds might fall when the arrival of the crop picks up after Diwali and farmers may face difficulties as lower duty on imported oils will encourage traders to import more and reduce dependency on domestic oilseed production. 'We have written to the Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal to roll back the present duty structure and increase it. Otherwise, the oilseed farmers will suffer,' said DN Pathak, executive director, Soybean Processors Association (SOPA).
