Last week, a pair of British activists tried to galvanize action on climate change by tossing a can of tomato soup at a Vincent van Gogh painting.
The two young agitators belonged to Just Stop Oil, an organization dedicated to opposing new fossil-fuel extraction, largely by means of nonviolent civil disobedience. 'What is worth more, art or life?' they asked shocked spectators in London's National Gallery. 'Are you more concerned about the protection of a painting or the protection of our planet?'
Many observers rejected the notion that they needed to choose between preserving Earthly life and enjoying van Gogh's sunflowers.
