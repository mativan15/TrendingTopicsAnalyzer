About 70 Wichita leaders, business professionals and rising young adults are back from last week's three-day, city-to-city trip to Minneapolis.

Organized annually by the Wichita Regional Chamber of Commerce, the group visits a different U.S. city each year to introduce business and community leaders to innovative projects and ideas that can be adapted and implemented back in Wichita. In Minneapolis Oct. 12 through 14, participants learned how the city approaches community dashboarding, collaborative partnerships, economic development, tourism and performing arts.
