Netflix has released the trailer for its Teletubbies reboot, featuring new faces and voices from the original show. Parents, be very afraid.
The trippy children's TV show, which was originally broadcast on the BBC between 1997 and 2001, had already been rebooted in 2015. 
When that first reboot was cancelled in 2018 after four seasons, that appeared to be the end of things for the Teletubbies on TV.
