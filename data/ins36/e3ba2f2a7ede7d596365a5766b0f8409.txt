Elon Musk has recommitted his pledge to provide war-torn Ukraine with internet connection.

The SpaceX CEO said the initiative to give the country 20,000 units has already cost $80m and will reach $100m by the end of the year.

'The hell with it … even though Starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we'll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free,' the billionaire tweeted.

SpaceX's Starlink network has helped those in Ukraine stay connected throughout the Russian invasion.
