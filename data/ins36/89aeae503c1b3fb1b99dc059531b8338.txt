To his formidable mother-in-law, Queen Victoria, Prince Henry of Battenberg made a gallant offer in the summer of 1887. He suggested marking her half-century on the throne by naming his second son, due to be born that autumn, Prince Jubilee. Happily, the Queen declined. The baby in question turned out to be a girl, christened Victoria instead.
For more than 200 years, just how to celebrate Royal jubilees has challenged those both inside and outside the Firm. In October 1809, 71-year-old George III was in no condition to participate in the large-scale public events planned for his Golden Jubilee – including a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral, dinner in the Mansion House and a fête at Frogmore – and within months would become mentally unfit to rule.
