Justin Sullivan What is the Goal of this Article? The goal of this article is to provide information to investors to help them choose if AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is a financially resilient or fragile business currently and for the future. This is not financial advice and investors should conduct their own research before investing to see if the companies discussed in this article fit into their portfolio parameters. For me personally, after doing the research, AMD still is a stock that fits my portfolio parameters and I believe it is making the right moves to becoming more financially resilient.
