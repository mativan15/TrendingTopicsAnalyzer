sarawuth702 Investment Thesis Ideanomics (NASDAQ:IDEX) is trading at a low price and isn't looking too ideal for short-term growth potential. Instead, the company's recent acquisitions and as-a-service business model position itself in value territory. It's going to be a long-term waiting game. It can potentially be profitable through the company's EV business moves through its recently acquired companies like Solectrac - manufacturer and distributor of electric agriculture equipment; US Hybrid - which designs and manufactures zero-emission electric powertrain components; Energica - the world's leading manufacturer of high-performance electric motorcycles, and many other potential avenues for growth for Ideanomics.
