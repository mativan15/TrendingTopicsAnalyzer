Billy Al Bengston, a Kansas-born California painter who drew inspiration from the car and surf culture of midcentury Los Angeles, and was part of a 1960s movement, known as L.A. Cool School, that helped transform the city from an art-world afterthought into a hub of contemporary art, died on Oct. 8 at his home in Venice, Calif. He was 88.

His wife, Wendy Al, confirmed the death, of unspecified cause.

A surfer, a motorcycle racer and briefly a Hollywood stuntman, Mr. Bengston found prominence in the late 1950s as part of a new wave of Southern California artists aligned with the pioneering Ferus Gallery in West Hollywood, founded by Walter Hopps and the artist Ed Kienholz.
