Over 200 people have gathered at Auckland's Western Park in a show of solidarity with Iranians around the world, who are taking to the streets to protest the Iranian regime's treatment of women. On September 16, 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died whilst in police custody. She had been arrested by the country's ‘Morality Police', who claimed she was not adhering to the Iranian regime's strict hijab requirements. Amini's death sparked a series of protests in Iran calling for women's right to freedom. Protesters have been arrested or beaten to death by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.
