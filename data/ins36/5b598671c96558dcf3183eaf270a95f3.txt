BERLIN — German lawmakers voted Friday to approve a 100 billion-euro ($107 billion) special fund to strengthen the country's military, preparing the way for a massive procurement drive three months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine jolted the government into action. The measure won broad support in the parliament's lower house after Chancellor Olaf Scholz's governing coalition held lengthy negotiations with the main opposition Union bloc. A majority of 593 lawmakers voted in favor of the fund, with 80 opposed and 7 abstaining.
