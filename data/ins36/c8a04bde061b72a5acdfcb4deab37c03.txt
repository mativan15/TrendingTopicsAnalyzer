LIMA, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Peru's economy expanded by 1.68% in August compared to the same month a year earlier, marking a slight acceleration in activity from July, figures from the national statistics institute (INEI) showed on Saturday.

INEI said growth in the world's No. 2 copper producer was driven by most sectors of the economy in August, pointing to gains in construction, transportation, hotels and restaurants, commerce, agriculture, power utilities and other services.
