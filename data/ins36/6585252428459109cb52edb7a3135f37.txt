Government payments to St John Ambulance for hours they must ramp ambulances should not be hidden from taxpayers as they currently are, Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson says.

'I think it should be [public],' she told a Business News breakfast on Thursday morning.

Georgina Wild, 80, died of a suspected heart attack while waiting hours for an ambulance in Perth.

'I think people should know what's going in and how it is going to be invested, so I don't have an issue with it.'

Under St John's current contract with the government, they are paid for every minute that a hospital is ramped, but the rate at which they are paid is kept secret under the barrier of 'commercial in confidence'.
