There is a huge scope for India to move in the global value chain systems and have high-value addition in global exports, Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal said on Thursday. India's share in global exports is less than 2 per cent. So, huge potential is there to boost the shipments despite global headwinds and low trade growth predictions, he added. "So, we can easily aim for doubling our exports and increasing our exports (share) to 10 per cent over a period of time and these opportunities exist even if somebody is saying that global trade scenario is looking bleak," he said here at the CII National Exports Summit.
