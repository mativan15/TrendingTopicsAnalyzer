Police have said removing Just Stop Oil protesters is a "work in progress" after 24 hours of delays on the Dartford Crossing.
On Monday, protesters forced closures on the crossing after they scaled the Queen Elizabeth II road bridge linking Essex to Kent in the early hours of the morning. A 33-year-old London teacher called Marcus and Morgan Trowland, a 39-year-old bridge engineer, had vowed to stay there and keep the bridge closed for 24 hours after climbing up the 275ft masts and securing themselves to the structure with climbing ropes and harnesses.
