Chewy (CHWY 6.15%) has some big questions to answer for investors on June 1. Shares of the online pet supplies company have underperformed the market by a wide margin in recent months, mainly due to worries about a slowdown in the e-commerce industry.
Chewy also gave investors reasons to worry in its last earnings report, which showed falling customer retention that might portend weaker growth ahead. CEO Sumit Singh and his team will likely discuss that issue, plus rising costs, in the upcoming report.
