CHELSEA striker Romelu Lukaku is reportedly keen to quit the club and return to Italy - but tax rules could scupper the move.
The 29-year-old Belgium international was the Blues' top scorer, with 15 goals in all competitions.

But only eight of these came in the Premier League, in 26 games.
After paying Inter Milan £97.5million to bring Lukaku back to England, more was expected.
Now, according to TuttoMercatoWeb, AC Milan and Juventus are sniffing around the forward.
