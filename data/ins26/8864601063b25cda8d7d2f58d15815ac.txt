Sadly, I identify all too well with the sentiments expressed by Kerry Hudson (Struggling to pay at the supermarket till, I felt that childhood shame flooding back, 29 May). As a child from a poor family, I remember furtively hiding my yellow 'free school dinner' ticket, identifiable to any onlooker by the different colour. I would palm it over to the dinner lady, swamped in shame – as if the polyester school uniform (provided by the local authority via vouchers from a portable building in the car park) weren't evidence enough that I was marked out as an 'under-being'.
