Germany wants to impose higher efficiency requirements on energy intensive companies, according to a draft proposal by the government.

Businesses consuming more than 2.5 gigawatt-hours in a year will be required to do energy audits, while those using more than 10 gigawatt-hours will also have to introduce energy or environment management systems, the proposal floated by the Economy Ministry late Tuesday in Berlin said.
