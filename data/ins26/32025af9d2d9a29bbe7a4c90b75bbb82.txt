Israeli prime minister, Yair Lapid, has criticised Labor's decision to drop the recognition of West Jerusalem as that country's capital and Australia's ambassador has been summoned to explain.

Lapid has accused the Australian government of a 'hasty' foreign policy shift, after it reversed the previous government's decision.

The Israeli foreign ministry also revealed that it would summon the Australian ambassador to a meeting to register its 'deep disappointment in the face of the Australian government's decision resulting from short-sighted political considerations'.
