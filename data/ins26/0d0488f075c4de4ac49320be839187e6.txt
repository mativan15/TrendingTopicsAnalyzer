Freeport-McMoRan Inc.'s third quarter earnings topped analyst expectations as the Phoenix-based mining giant grapples with what it called a 'strikingly tight' copper market.

In its latest filing, the company reported quarterly revenue of just over $5 billion, which was down from just over $6 billion a year earlier. Net income for the quarter was $404 million, which was down by nearly $1 billion from Q3 2021.

That translated to an adjusted net income of 26 cents per share. That price slightly beat Wall Street estimates by just over 5%, though it was 23.
