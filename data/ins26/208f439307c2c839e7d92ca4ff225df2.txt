Liverpool stars Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah both reportedly wanted £400,000-a-week to pen new deals at Anfield. Mane looks set to call time on his Reds career this summer and head for Bayern Munich, while Salah has just one year remaining on his current deal and could also eventually be on his way if his demands aren't met.Liverpool have become one of the best teams in Europe under manager Jurgen Klopp, who joined the club in 2015. In the last three years they have won the Champions League and Premier League, and also lifted the FA Cup and Carabao Cup.
