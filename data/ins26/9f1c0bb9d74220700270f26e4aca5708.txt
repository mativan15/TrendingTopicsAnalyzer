Matthew Wright divided This Morning viewers after questioning the extent of the Queen's platinum jubilee celebrations.

The broadcaster appeared on the ITV series on Friday (3 June) to discuss the four days of lavish events taking place to honour Queen Elizabeth II's 70 years on the throne.

Wright didn't hold back when talking about his true feelings on the subject, acknowlegding the 'spectacle' as 'wonderful', but stating it comes 'at a time when we are haemorrhaging money as a country' due to the cost of living crisis.
