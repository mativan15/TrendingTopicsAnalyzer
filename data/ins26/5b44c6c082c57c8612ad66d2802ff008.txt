How would you identify a rich person 50 years ago? They apparently wore a Rolex watch, drove a Mercedes or Ferrari, wore Versace, and walked around with an original Fendi bag.
In the past, we identified who belongs to the elite class out of conspicuous markers, but today the new marker of the elites is a consumption that is not conspicuous or eye-popping. If in the past the elite was characterized by silverware (Silver Spoons), a Rolex, or Mercedes, today the elite group shows behavioral patterns that are 180 degrees different from the ones we used to associate with the "rich" people.
