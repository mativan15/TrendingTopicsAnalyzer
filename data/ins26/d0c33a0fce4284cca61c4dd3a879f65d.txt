Collider.com Editor's Note: The following contains spoilers for Episodes 1-6 of Andor.Diego Luna's performance in Andor is a different type of protagonist than the ones we've seen before in the Star Wars franchise. While the saga has had its fair share of both grizzled old men and young dreamers, Cassian has the youth of Luke Skywalker and the cynicism of Han Solo.
