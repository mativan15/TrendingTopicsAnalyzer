Hedge fund giant Tiger Global has plummeted 52% so far this year through the end of May, according to a Bloomberg report.The fund saw its losses accelerate last month as it fell 14.2%, significantly underperforming the broader stock market indices. In May, the S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq 100 fell just 2%. The latest decline also deepened year-to-date losses at the hedge fund, which was down 44% at the end of April.The losses have wiped out more than $16 billion in assets under management for Tiger Global, erasing years of spectacular gains as founder Chase Coleman rose tech stocks all the way up — and now all the way down.
