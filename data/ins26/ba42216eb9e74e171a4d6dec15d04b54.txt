Welcome to the second installment of our 2022 Power 100, the NBJ newsroom's list of the most influential people in the city's business scene.

Today, we introduce you to the Heavy Hitters. These are the biggest names in town, the legacy players in Nashville business. Their family names open doors, and they have deep pockets. They're longstanding members of Nashville's business elite. You might call them the old guard, except they are still wielding significant influence across the city.

As a reminder, Power 100 is an assessment based on our newsroom's reporting and expertise covering the region's high-powered business community to know who's driving decisions, both in the headlines and behind the scenes.
