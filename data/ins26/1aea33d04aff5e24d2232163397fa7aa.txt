Published: 18:13 EDT, 15 October 2022 | Updated: 18:17 EDT, 15 October 2022 The Government maintains its controversial HS2 project remains within budget in spite of leaked documents which suggest the first phase could blow out 'many billions' more than anticipated.The HS2 rail project - which is set to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds in a bid to rebalance the UK's economy -  has been called 'expensive, wasteful and destructive' by environmentalists. Critics claim the line will destroy or irreparably damage 108 ancient woodlands and 693 wildlife sites, and that Euston Square Gardens will be built over with a temporary taxi rank before being sold off to developers.
