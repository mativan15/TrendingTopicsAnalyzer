TORONTO - A Toronto city councillor who was seeking re-election in Monday's municipal election has died.

Mayor John Tory said he was 'saddened' to learn of Cynthia Lai's death on Friday afternoon, and offered condolences to her husband and sons.

'They will be joined in mourning by many friends and by the many people she served so well over the years,' Tory said in a written statement.

Tory said he had knew Lai for more than 20 years, and was impressed by her professionalism in her various roles as a politician and a past president of the Toronto Real Estate Board, a job in which Tory said Lai was the first Chinese-Canadian woman elected.
