Mike Ashley has stepped back from his multibillion-pound retail empire four decades after setting up his first shop.The billionaire formally stepped down as a director of Frasers Group at the company's annual general meeting yesterday, handing over day-to-day running of the FTSE 100 group to Michael Murray, his son-in-law.However, Frasers was dealt a blow over plans to hand Murray, 33, a bonus worth £100 million when 12.2 per cent of voting shareholders rejected its remuneration report.Ashley is expected to retain influence over the stores business through his controlling stake of almost 70 per cent, but has said that he feels 'very confident passing the baton' to Murray.
