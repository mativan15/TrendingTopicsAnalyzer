Published: 10:29 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 13:09 EDT, 17 October 2022 Tottenham manager Antonio Conte has put to rest fears Richarlison could miss the World Cup by confirming the forward is expected to be fit to feature in the tournament next month. The Brazilian sustained a calf injury during the second half of Saturday's 2-0 win over Everton and left the ground on crutches. Richarlison gave a tearful interview post-match where he conceded his World Cup dreams could be over but his club boss provided a positive update on the 25-year-old when previewing Wednesday's trip to Manchester United.
