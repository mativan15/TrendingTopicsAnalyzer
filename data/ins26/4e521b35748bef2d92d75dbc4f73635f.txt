As people reorganise their lives around the surprise closure of State Highway 6, one valley is facing total isolation. Kokorua Rd connects a dozen households to the highway at Whangamoa, in the hills between Marlborough and Nelson, close to where the heaviest rain fell during severe flooding in August. Kokorua Rd farmer and Rai Valley fire chief Nigel Patterson hosted Waka Kotahi officials and neighbours on Thursday to discuss the seven-week closure for flood repairs between Hira and Rai Valley from November 1.
