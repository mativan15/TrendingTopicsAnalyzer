Russia has claimed that Britain has never experienced a PM as disgraceful as Liz Truss, who announced her resignation as UK prime minister today. "The catastrophic ignorance and the queen's funeral immediately after her audience with Liz Truss will be remembered," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Telegram.  AP"Britain has never known such a disgrace as Prime Minister."
Moscow and London's relationship has worsened due to problems like the Salisbury poisoning of a former Russian spy in 2018.
