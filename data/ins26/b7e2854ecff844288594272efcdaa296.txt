Ministers have been warned of potential power cuts to as many as six million households this winter, according to reports. Government modelling of a "reasonable" worst-case scenario predicts major gas shortages in winter if Russia cuts off more supplies to the European Union, the Times says.
Limits could be imposed on industrial use of gas, including on gas-fired power stations, causing electricity shortages, and six million homes could see their electricity rationed in curbs that may last more than a month, mostly at peaks in the morning and evening.
