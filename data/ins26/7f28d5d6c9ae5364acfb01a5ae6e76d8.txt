APFILE- In this Sept. 5, 2018, file photo, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington. Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, claimed in 2008 that he hired Sheryl Sandberg, a Google executive, because 'she has just about the most relevant industry experience for Facebook, especially since we need to scale our operations and scale them globally.' Zuckerberg was 23, and Sandberg was 38. Facebook has since become a behemoth, and Zuckerberg is the same age as Sandberg was when he hired her.
