SweetBunFactory This is a tricky time to invest in industrials, and Nordson's (NASDAQ:NDSN) multi-market diversification doesn't really help now given the growing concerns about end-markets like semiconductors, consumer electronics, short-cycle industrial, and consumer non-durables. Likewise, this tends to be a capex-driven business with relatively little cycle visibility. On the other hand, this is a niche-oriented business with a proven track record of performance, and I like the company's focus on managing for long-term performance (and not short-cycle optimization).
