Every investor in Metro Bank PLC (LON:MTRO) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. I quite like to see at least a little bit of insider ownership. As Charlie Munger said 'Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.

With a market capitalization of UK£135m, Metro Bank is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors.
