The Layla Kapok Pillow is a popular adjustable bed pillow made from shredded memory foam blended with natural Kapok (a sustainably-sourced fiber that feels similar to cotton). It's created by mattress manufacturer Layla Sleep, and there's a big focus on cooling comfort here, making it a good choice for hot weather and sleepers prone to overheating at night. It comes with a bag of extra fill too, so you can make the pillow as shallow or as deep as needed to suit the position you feel most comfortable sleeping in.
