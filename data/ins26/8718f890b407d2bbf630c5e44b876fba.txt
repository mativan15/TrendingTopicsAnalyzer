A Central Ohio electric vehicle battery project is getting $75 million in federal support.

Cirba Solutions last week announced a $200 million expansion of its Lancaster operations.

President Joe Biden Wednesday announced $2.8 billion federal funding for 20 electric battery projects across the country, including $75 million toward Cirba's Central Ohio plans.

Cirba will use the funds to expand its critical mineral upgrading assets at its lithium-ion processing facility.

The company is a recycler.
