Eyes across the globe have been focused on Amber Heard and Johnny Depp for the past six weeks as the details of their tumultuous marriage have been revealed during their defamation case.
Depp is suing Heard for defamation following a 2018 article she did for Washington Post in which she described herself as a ‘public figure representing domestic abuse'.
Heard has also countersued Depp for leading a ‘smear campaign' against the actress after a former member of his legal team branded her domestic violence claims ‘a hoax'.
