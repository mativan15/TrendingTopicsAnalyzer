Rishi Sunak is to forge ahead with plans for an 'NFT for Britain' despite market turmoil that has wiped billions of pounds off the digital assets.
The Chancellor and Royal Mint remain committed to creating a state-backed non-fungible token, spokesmen said, even though the size of the market has fallen from a peak of $37bn (£29bn) in April to around $26bn and several high profile sales have flopped.
Mr Sunak surprised economists last month when he announced plans to delve into the craze for NFTs, which are effectively online certificates showing that the holder owns something, usually digital art.
