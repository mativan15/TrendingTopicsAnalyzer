The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) is reportedly alarmed by China's alleged hiring of some 30 veteran British military pilots to teach trainees in the People's Liberation Army.The practice is legal and was first noticed by the British government in 2019, when a handful of such cases were identified, an unnamed official explained, according to several Western news outlets, including the BBC, Sky News and the New York Times.According to media reports, the MoD considers the situation grave enough to issue a formal 'threat alert' to warn serving and former pilots about the Chinese recruitment drive.
