Ten years later, as a leading seaman, he again attempted the AIB, and this time passed. He served briefly in the carrier Hermes as a petty officer before joining Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, where he passed out top of his class.
Of his long rise from the lowerdeck to the quarterdeck, Nowosielski said: 'There has always been the opportunity in the Navy for people from the lowerdeck to [become officers] but it's not easy … [and] you have to have a lot of commitment as well. It has taken me longer to reach this position [command of Victory] than it would have had I entered as a junior officer, but it has given me a great deal of experience of life on the lowerdeck which hopefully I can use.
