Patriots coming off surprising shutout; Browns desperate

The Cleveland Brown host the New England Patriots on Sunday, and a win would improve one of the teams to .500 on the year. Cleveland fans probably lament some of their team's misfortune, as all three of the Browns' losses have been by three or fewer points.

As for the Patriots, they are coming off an impressive 29-0 victory over a Lions team that led the league in scoring through four weeks with 35 points per game. What's even more amazing about the game was that New England started a third-string quarterback in Bailey Zappe, who also happens to be a rookie.
