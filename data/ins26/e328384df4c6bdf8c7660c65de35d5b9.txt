As a result, they will buy an average of 36 percent of their Christmas shopping locally – including food, drinks, stocking fillers, and wrapping paper.This is because 51 percent see their local businesses as an important part of the community – with as many as two-thirds (67 percent) considering a local business owner a friend.And six in ten are concerned about their independent retailers, while nearly half (46 percent) would be sorry to see a local retailer forced to close.More than a third (36 percent) are prepared to spend more on their Christmas shopping, if they need to, to support their high street.
