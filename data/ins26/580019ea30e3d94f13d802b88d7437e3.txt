Google Hopwood DePree and you'll come across multiple photos of a chap who looks like he could have been in the Brat Pack: shaggy blonde hair, blue eyes, teeth as straight as sugar cubes, wide Hollywood grin.
Look him up further on the film database, IMDB, and you'll discover that Hopwood has indeed acted, albeit not in any high school flick. He was once a 1995 film called Rhinoskin, starring as an actor trying to make it in the business, and a couple of other parts followed, but it's probably fair to say he hasn't been overly burdened by invitations to the Oscars ceremony since.
