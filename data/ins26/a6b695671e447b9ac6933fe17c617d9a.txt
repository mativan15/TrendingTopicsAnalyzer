STORY: Mikaeil Alizadeh used to give dance lessons in secret in Iran.

She moved to Turkey in 2015, after receiving threats - fearing she'd be jailed for being a dancer.

A neighbor had even reported her to the police. They accused her of being a prostitute.

I had to make a choice, she says - between dancing, or living in Iran.

Now - she is hoping to use her voice from abroad - for change in her home country.

Alizadeh is one of hundreds of Iranians who have attended protests in Turkey - triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini.
