As investors search for quality stocks after a choppy month for equities, Barclays has some buy-rated picks that are cheap and expected to generate lots of cash. On Tuesday, stocks struggled to find a direction in the final day of trading in May. All month, stocks have logged some wild moves, with the S & P 500 briefly dipping into bear market territory. All three major averages remain well off their highs with the Dow Jones Industrial Average about 11% below its record, the S & P 500 down more than 14%, and the Nasdaq off by roughly 26%.
