Scott Olson/Getty Images News Oatly (NASDAQ:OTLY) produces dairy alternatives using oats. This includes oat-based milk, yoghurt, and ice cream. When the company went public in May 2021 it did so at the top of its indicated range at $17 per share, raising $1.4 billion. A $10 billion valuation that was far above Beyond Meat (BYND), another plant-based food stock market darling. Just over a year later and Oatly is now trading at a $2.4 billion valuation with the price of its common shares at just over $4.
