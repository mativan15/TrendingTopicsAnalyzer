Director Prem is the latest to hop on the pan-India bandwagon with his latest movie KD – The Devil. The teaser of the film was unveiled in the presence of media members from across the country. Bankrolled by KVN, the film stars Dhruva Sarja in the lead role.
KD's teaser has been cut with the nervous energy that's typical of Prem's movies. Set in the 1970s Bangalore, now Bengaluru, the film is said to be inspired by real-life events.
The teaser opens with the entire police department being put on a high alert as a most wanted gangster is set to get out of jail.
