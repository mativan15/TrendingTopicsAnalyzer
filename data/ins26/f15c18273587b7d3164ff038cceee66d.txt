To launch the virtual meta-pride parade on June 24, NYX Professional Makeup has tapped People of Crypto Lab (POC), a creative and innovation lab dedicated to increasing representation in Web3, and The Sandbox, a leading decentralized gaming metaverse. With diversity and inclusion at the heart of the partnership, NYX Professional Makeup will be the first cosmetics brand to be integrated into The Sandbox. The Web3 initiative will include a uniquely diverse representation of marginalized communities in the form of digital NFT avatars.
