UP Yoddhas found some form as they defeated Bengaluru Bulls 44-37 in their recent PKL 9 match, at the Kanteerava Stadium on Sunday. Speaking after the win, head coach Jasveer Singh hailed Pardeep Narwal, saying, "After attaining a massive lead in the first half, we wanted to play safe in the second half as we didn't want any injuries and that's why Bengaluru picked up a lot of points in the second half. But, I think we played a bit too safe in certain occasions, which was our mistake. The biggest positive for us is that Pardeep is back in form.
