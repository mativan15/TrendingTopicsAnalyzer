The U.S. Department of Education announced Wednesday that it will cancel the federal student loans of hundreds of thousands of people.
Those people borrowed money to attend Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit group of schools that was judged to have carried out fraud.
Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona announced the move to cancel or 'discharge' the loans. His message was for students who went to schools run by Corinthian Colleges between 1995 and 2015 and who still owe money.
'Every student deceived, defrauded and driven into debt … can rest assured that the Biden-Harris administration has their back,' he said.
