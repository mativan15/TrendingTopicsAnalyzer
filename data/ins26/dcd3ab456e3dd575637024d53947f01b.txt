Shareholders will be ecstatic, with their stake up 24% over the past week following Dr. Martens plc's (LON:DOCS) latest annual results. Revenues were UK£908m, approximately in line with expectations, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) performed substantially better. EPS of UK£0.18 were also better than expected, beating analyst predictions by 15%. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual.
