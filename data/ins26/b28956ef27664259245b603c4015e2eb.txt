Whether this draw represents the green shoots of recovery or a stay of execution for Ralph Hasenhuttl remains to be seen. It is a point that suits West Ham far better than Southampton and there were muted boos from the home crowd at the final whistle.
Saints had lost their previous four before this and won only three of their previous 21 league games, fuelling speculation of Hasenhuttl's departure.
Here, they were bright in the first half but it was David Moyes' side who were much the better in the second half and they looked the more likely to win.
