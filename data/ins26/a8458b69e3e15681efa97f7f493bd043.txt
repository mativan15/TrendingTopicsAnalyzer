damircudic Elevator Pitch My rating for Futu Holdings Limited's (NASDAQ:FUTU) shares is a Hold. I previously reviewed FUTU's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2021 in an article published on March 15, 2022. I share my latest thoughts on Futu Holdings in this article. Futu Holdings has been working hard to diversify the company's operations in terms of geography and business. But FUTU's post-Q2 2022 results share price performance indicates that the changes to the company's revenue and client mix aren't perceived to be sufficiently significant at this point in time.
