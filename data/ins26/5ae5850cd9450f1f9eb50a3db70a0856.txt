NASA will be launching its mission to Venus later this decade which will carry an instrument built by students. What is it? How will it help scientists? Check details here. NASA is all set for its mission to Venus at the end of this decade to explore the mysteries of the planet. The new development comes from the space agency Venus Oxygen Fugacity (VfOx), a small, button-sized sensor which will be designed, fabricated, tested, operated, and analyzed by students aboard NASA's DAVINCI Mission. These students will be undergraduates and graduates who will join the mission team under the Student Collaboration Experiment.
