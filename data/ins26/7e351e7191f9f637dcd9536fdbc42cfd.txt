Virtual fit technology has never enjoyed widespread success but a new company is set to change everything. Bods enables online shoppers to visualize how clothes of various sizes will look and fit in real life via an AI generated digital rendering of their actual body. The company, founded by former model Christine Marzano recently secured $5.6million in seed funding from Stellation Capital plus fellow model Karlie Kloss and Rent the Runway co-founder Jenny Fleiss.
