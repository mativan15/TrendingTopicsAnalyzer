AgenciesThe GBP/USD pair has had a rollercoaster ride since the announcement of the infamous mini-budget last month. The sterling pound further slipped last week after UK prime minister Liz Truss fired Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, who many considered a scapegoat for the financial turmoil. The pair maintained its August-to-October downward trend at $1.138 before the cross came off again. The EUR/GBP trade continued to align with the 55-day simple moving average (SMA). EUR/GBP traders eagerly await the emergency fiscal policy statement that the newly appointed finance minister, Jeremy Hunt, is scheduled to deliver to the House of Commons on Monday afternoon.
