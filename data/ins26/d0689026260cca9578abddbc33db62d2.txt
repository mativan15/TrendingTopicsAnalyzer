The window on 2022 is closing but there's still some time and some reasons for the S&P 500 to improve what's been a dismal performance this year, according to Oppenheimer Asset Management. The index's nearly 25% slide prompted the firm to cut its 2022 S&P 500 forecast by 17%, to 4,000 from 4,800. Though lower, that's still a nearly 10% jump from Monday's opening level of 3,636. "Our year-end target price reduction for the S&P 500 is simply a function of the few weeks left in the year to effect a massive rally short of a miracle based on the levels of uncertainty the market has to digest at this time," John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, said in a note published Monday.
