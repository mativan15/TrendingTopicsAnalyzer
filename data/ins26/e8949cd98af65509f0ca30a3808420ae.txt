We already know that Amazon Prime Day 2022 will take place in July, but that's not stopping Walmart from beating Amazon to the punch. Starting at 3pm ET (12pm PT) on June 2, paid members of Walmart Plus will have exclusive access to the company's Walmart Plus Weekend sale, which brings discounts to thousands of items across the site. Access to this sale is not available to those who are using a Walmart Plus trial, so you'll need to pay to upgrade your membership in order to shop these discounts. Walmart Plus Weekend brings sales across nearly every category that Walmart sells, including tech, home, patio, food, auto, pets, toys and clothing.
