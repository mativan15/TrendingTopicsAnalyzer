Statistically speaking, long term investing is a profitable endeavour. But no-one is immune from buying too high. To wit, the National Western Life Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NWLI) share price managed to fall 52% over five long years. We certainly feel for shareholders who bought near the top. Furthermore, it's down 12% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. However, one could argue that the price has been influenced by the general market, which is down 7.4% in the same timeframe.

With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
