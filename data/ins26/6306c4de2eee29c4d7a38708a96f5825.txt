For a 20-year-old, the charm to wear new clothes and shoes is sure special. But what's more noteworthy is when boxer Poonam Poonia wins medals and hearts to reach new heights of success. Hailing from Hisar, Haryana, she's presently soaking in the adulation coming her way ever since she won gold at the recent National Games. With a twinkle in her eyes, she shares, 'India ke sabse bada games the yeh, toh bahut zyaad khush hun yahan jeetkar. I did win a gold medal at the Youth World Championships in 2021, but this recent one was my first appearance at the National Games and I'm glad to have become a champion!' Poonia defeated Punjab's Mandeep Kaur in 57kg Women's Featherweight finals, and recalls how her life has changed ever since she took up boxing.
