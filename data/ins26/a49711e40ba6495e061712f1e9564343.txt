May 27—A year after the indictment of a Hamilton man in the 2018 shooting death of a 16-year-old girl, it doesn't appear a trial will happen anytime soon.

Markeylnd Townsend, 23, was indicted in April 2021 for murder and felonious assault stemming from a July 2018 incident in Fairfield Twp. He is accused of firing a weapon into a car full of people driven by Sydney Garcia-Tovar, 16, of Hamilton, who died of a gunshot wound.

Passenger Joseph Goolsby, 21, also was shot, and recovered from his injuries.
