Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced a new $2.9 million grant program on Tuesday to address the boarding crisis in Massachusetts hospitals.

Boarding occurs when a patient seeking mental health treatment is forced to wait—sometimes for days or even weeks— in the emergency department or in an inpatient bed until a psychiatric bed, or other necessary services, become available.

Called the Mental Health Diversionary Services Grant, the program will be funded in part by the almost $1 million Healey's office received in behavioral health parity settlements in 2019 and 2020.
