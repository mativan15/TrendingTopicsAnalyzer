individual vs joint brokerage account

When it comes to investing, you can go it alone or with a partner. That's true no matter what form your assets take, including brokerage accounts. With an individual brokerage account, you're the only person with any rights to the portfolio. Only you can make decisions about the account and its contents belong entirely to you. With a joint brokerage account, you share rights to this portfolio with someone else. You and they can both make decisions about the account and its contents belong to the both of you.
