Google has settled two other privacy complaints for nearly $200 million in recent months.

Google is headed to court, again, to defend itself against accusations of privacy violations.

On Thursday Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced that his office sued Google for allegedly gathering biometric data from millions of Texans without their informed consent.

"Google's indiscriminate collection of the personal information of Texans, including very sensitive information like biometric identifiers, will not be tolerated,' Paxton said.
