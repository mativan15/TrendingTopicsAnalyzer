Tech companies have a mixed reputation when it comes to climate change and sustainability issues, but with its recently launched Vero line of 'green PCs', Acer hopes to boost its credibility in this area. There are a number of products in the Vero range, including laptops, desktop PCs and monitors, but the main offering for business users is the 15.6-inch TravelMate Vero running Windows 11 Pro.   Acer TravelMate Vero: 15.6-inch IPS screen, Core i5 or i7 (UK only at the moment) processor, integrated Iris Xe graphics, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage.
