An appeal has been filed before the Supreme Court challenging a Gauhati High Court's order of upholding Assam Repealing Act 2020 which converted state-funded madrassas into regular schools. The appeal was filed by Md. Imad Uddin Barbhuiya. The repealing Act of 2020 takes away property coupled with statutory recognition of Madrassa education and the impugned order dated February 12, 2021 issued by the Governor disbands the ‘Assam State Madrasa Board' created in 1954. It amounts to an arbitrary exercise of both legislative and executive powers and amounts to a denial of the Petitioner Madrassas' ability to continue as madrassas providing religious instruction coupled with religious education," the plea stated.
