hapabapa/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) has soared on news Amazon (AMZN) has contracted with the airline to operate and manage a fleet of cargo planes. The deal comes with a major catch, and Amazon isn't known as a great customer. My investment thesis is ultra Bullish on the airlines, but this deal doesn't pass the mustard for rushing into owning this airline stock. Cargo Deal Hawaiian signed a commercial deal with Amazon to operate a fleet of 10 Airbus A330-300 freighters starting in the fall of 2023.
