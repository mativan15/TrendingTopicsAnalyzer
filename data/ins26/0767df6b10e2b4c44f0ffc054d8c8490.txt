The British government has made mistakes, the new finance minister Jeremy Hunt has said, referring to the cabinet's controversial tax cut plans which prompted turmoil in financial markets and triggered the abrupt sacking of his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng.
'There were mistakes. It was a mistake when we're going to be asking for difficult decisions across the board on tax and spending to cut the rate of tax paid by the very wealthiest,' Hunt told Sky News on Saturday in his first full day as chancellor of the exchequer.
