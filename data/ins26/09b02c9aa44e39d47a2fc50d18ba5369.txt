The Albanese government has assured Israel that Australia remains a 'strong supporter' and has denied making any formal policy change after a government department deleted a public statement recognising West Jerusalem as the country's capital.The change in language, first revealed by Guardian Australia on Monday, prompted the former prime minister Scott Morrison to argue that the 'disappointing' move suggested the new government was watering down Australia's support for Israel.In the past few days, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has deleted from its website a passage that said 'in December 2018, Australia recognised West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, being the seat of the Knesset and many of the institutions of the Israeli government'.
