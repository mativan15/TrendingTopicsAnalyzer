Funding that finally gave Auckland Pride the go-ahead to hire a creative director, a role that supports the LGBTQ+ artists and performers, has been scrapped a year after it was introduced. At the end of last month, Auckland Pride received news that funding for its creative director role from the Creative New Zealand Arts Grant had been declined. It was Creative New Zealand that had initially enabled this role in 2021. It isn't the only group that has been affected, with many across the country losing funding from Creative New Zealand which itself is chronically underfunded, one academic says.
