Published: 04:18 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 04:18 EDT, 2 June 2022 Formula One great Alan Jones believes Daniel Ricciardo's days at McLaren are numbered, unless he can swiftly start to deliver results and warned his fellow Australian 'nice guys don't get anywhere' in the sport.The 32-year-old has endured a dismal start to his second season with McLaren, finishing in the top-10 just once in the first seven rounds - when he claimed sixth place at his home Grand Prix - and scoring just 11 points.By contrast, his teammate Lando Norris has already racked up 48 points and has outscored Ricciardo in all but two races, finishing sixth in Monaco last Sunday with the Australian 13th.
