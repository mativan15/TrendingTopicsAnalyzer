The England playmaker - passed fit to play on Sunday after a precautionary scan on a thigh issue - capitalised on a dreadful early Tyrone Mings blunder before notching an excellent second-half free-kick as his side made it five successive victories across all competitions under their new head coach, who has yet to be beaten since leaving Brighton for the Blues.A 2-0 defeat heaps more pressure on under-fire Villa boss Steven Gerrard, whose team actually impressed for the most part here, not lacking effort and intensity and fashioning multiple first-half chances only to find Kepa Arrizabalaga in inspired form in the Chelsea goal.
