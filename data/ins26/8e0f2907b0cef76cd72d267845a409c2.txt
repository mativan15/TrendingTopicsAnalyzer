The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has notified the amendment in the faceless penalty scheme, allowing mandatory personal hearing through electronic mode to any taxpayer who has sought a hearing. The amendment has omitted the Regional Faceless Penalty Centre from the Faceless Penalty Scheme and provides that electronic records shall be authenticated by the National Faceless Penalty Centre and even hearing should be done via them and not regional faceless penalty centre.

The Faceless Penalty (Amendment) Scheme, 2022, notified on Friday says that such hearing will be held exclusively through video conferencing or video telephony, including use of any telecommunication application software which supports video conferencing or video telephony.
