Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen acknowledged in an interview on Tuesday that she was 'wrong' about 'the path that inflation would take' as the lagging COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion in Ukraine have kept prices persistently high.
During an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, the network played a clip of previous comments she made in 2021 in which she said inflation would be a 'small risk' and that 'I don't anticipate that inflation is going to be a problem.'
'Well, look, I think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,' the Treasury secretary said when asked about her previous comments.
