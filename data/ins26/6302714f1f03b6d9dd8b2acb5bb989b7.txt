The Karnataka Digital Economy Mission (KDEM), an initiative of Government of Karnataka and the technology industry, is looking to increasing IT exports from Mysuru from the present ₹5,000 crore to ₹10,000 crore by 2026. Speaking to reporters in Mysuru on Tuesday, Chief Executive Officer of KDEM Sanjeev Gupta said the talent in the IT industry in Mysuru was presently around 80,000. 'Our aspiration is to take the number to 1,50,000 by 2026', he said while hoping that events like The Big Tech Show 2022, which is scheduled to be held on October 19 and 20, will help Mysuru reach the milestone.
