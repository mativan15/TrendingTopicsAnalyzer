October 18, 2022 / 9:54 AM / CBS/AP Less than a month ahead of November's midterm elections, at least three political campaign signs were placed on someone's property in southeastern Pennsylvania and found booby-trapped with razor blades, local police said over the weekend.The signs separately promoted the campaigns of gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro, U.S. Senate candidate John Fetterman and U.S. House candidate Ashley Ehasz, all of whom are Democrats. In a Facebook post shared on Sunday evening, the Upper Makefield Township Police Department said that the person whose property was targeted with booby-trapped signage "ended up slicing their fingers" while trying to remove one for Shapiro's campaign.
