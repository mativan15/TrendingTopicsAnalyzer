Chewy's (CHWY -1.30%) share price is down 75% since reaching an all-time high of $120 in early 2021. As that performance suggests, investor expectations were very low entering the fiscal first-quarter earnings report on June 1. After the company showed sales increased 14% year over year with improving profitability over the previous quarter, the stock jumped 24%. 
Value investors are on the hunt for deeply discounted stocks during this market correction, names that can rebound from their lows and eventually deliver big returns.
