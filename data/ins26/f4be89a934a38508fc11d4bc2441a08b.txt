What does the stock market want? Two things: an easing of supply chain issues and a soft landing for the U.S. and global economy. The first is showing signs of improvement. The second is going to be more elusive. Daimler Truck became one of the latest companies to say they were pushing past the global chip shortage. Other companies such as Foxconn have also made comments recently that global supply chain issues were improving. Goldilocks is the soft landing everyone wants, but it is proving very elusive.
