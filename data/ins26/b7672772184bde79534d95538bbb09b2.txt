Top Republicans, who contend inflation will devour Biden's proposed 4 percent defense hike, envision an even larger cash infusion when annual defense policy and spending bills come up for debate in the coming weeks.
'I just think we have everything on our side on this thing,' Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the top Senate Armed Services Republican, said in a brief interview. 'We ought to be able to get the adequate increases that we want.'
Democrats will be forced to either back Biden's blueprint or — as they did last year — ladle on billions more in military spending.
