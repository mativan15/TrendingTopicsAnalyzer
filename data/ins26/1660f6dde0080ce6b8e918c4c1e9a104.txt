What do Joe Biden and Harry S. Truman have in common? Both presidents ran the US when American stockpiles of distillate fuel were exceptionally low. Currently, the US has just 106 million barrels of diesel and heating oil in commercial stocks; the last time inventories were that low in mid-October was in 1951, when Truman was in the White House. Typically, inventories should be 30% higher this time of the year.

Such low levels are alarming because diesel is the workhorses of the global economy.
