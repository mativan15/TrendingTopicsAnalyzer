Q.What is a Central Bank Digital Currency?
CBDC is a legal tender issued by a central bank in digital form. It would be your regular, sovereign-backed currency note, only in a digital format. Termed e-rupee, you will not need a bank account to spend or receive this money. Issued as tokens, the RBI's e-rupee will be at par with regular cash. You can use it to make payments and also exchange it for physical notes from the bank.
