Politicians in a democracy are supposed to represent their constituents. Which is what makes Sophie Howe's position so unusual. As the future generations commissioner for Wales, it's her task to call out policymakers when they're on the verge of making a decision that might harm people in the long run — including people of the future who haven't yet been born.
It's a job that exists because Wales in 2015 passed the Well-being of Future Generations Act, which sets out long-term goals — like addressing socioeconomic disadvantage or ecological resilience — and obligates public institutions to work toward them.
