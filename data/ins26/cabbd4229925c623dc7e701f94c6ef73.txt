That's when the Richmond, B.C.–based airline, which specializes in seaplanes, completed the first direct all-electric point-to-point test flight (that is, the first such flight that landed in a different place than it took off). A retrofitted De Havilland Beaver, with its internal-combustion engine swapped out for an electric motor and battery system, flew just over 70 kilometres, from Vancouver to Victoria, in 20 minutes.
