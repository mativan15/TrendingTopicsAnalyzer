Shares of Tesla Inc sank 9 percent  in early trading as Wall Street analysts worry that the electric carmaker's growth momentum may have hit a speed bump due to rapid inflation and logistical challenges.
At least five brokerages on Thursday cut their price target on the stock, citing softer car deliveries in 2022. Wedbush Securities made the biggest cut of $60 to bring its target to $300.
'The bullish narrative is clearly hitting a rough patch as Tesla must now prove again to the Street that the robust growth story is running into a myriad of logistics issues as opposed to demand softening,' Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said.
