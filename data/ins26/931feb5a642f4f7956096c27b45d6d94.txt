The Chicago Bears are shopping Pro Bowl defensive end Robert Quinn ahead of the NFL's Nov. 1 trade deadline, according to CBS Sports' Jason LaCanfora.

Quinn is coming off one of his most productive NFL seasons, where he set a franchise record with 18.5 sacks in 2021. He also earned Pro Bowl and All-Pro honors.

Unfortunately, Quinn has gotten off to a bit of a slow start this season, as he has just one sack in six games this season. Still, there figures to be a contending team out there that could certainly benefit from Quinn's services in their quest for a Super Bowl title.
