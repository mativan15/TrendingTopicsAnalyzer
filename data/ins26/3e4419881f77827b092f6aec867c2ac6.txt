Oct. 16—Rob Hotaling, the Independent candidate for Governor of Connecticut, says that he is the true moderate in this year's gubernatorial race.

In general elections, where politicians jockey for the title of "moderate" in an effort to appeal to a wider swath of voters, Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont and Republican candidate Bob Stefanowski have positioned themselves as moderates within their own parties, and have sought to discredit the other's bipartisan bonafides. In a race where Stefanowski says he is center-right, and Lamont center-left, Hotaling has laid claim to being directly in the center.
