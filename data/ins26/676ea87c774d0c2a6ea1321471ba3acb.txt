As the country grapples with a crippling crisis due to the spiralling global cost of gas, Britain has been scrambling to wean itself off fossil fuels so consumers can avoid forking out extra cash. Now, a renewable project between Octopus and Ilker will let homebuyers purchase homes with solar panels, battery storage and air source heat pumps so that they are self-sufficient.This means the homes will not be powered by gas, and in turn, homeowners would only have to pay energy bills if they use over 10MWh of energy.
