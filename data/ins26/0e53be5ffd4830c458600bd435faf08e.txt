'Knowledge workers,' as defined in 1959 by Peter Drucker, are 'those who generate value through their minds rather than through their muscles, and their labour would be both dynamic and autonomous.' In knowledge work industries, workers need to have a range of technological, social, emotional, and higher cognitive skills, and often require training on a regular basis to keep their skills updated. In the last of a series of four whitepapers created by The Economist and sponsored by Microsoft, the authors note the correlation between knowledge work and higher education.
