In the more than two years that student loan payments have been paused, Ben Dufault saved enough money to buy his first house. Yasin Mohamud paid off other debts and saved for a move to his dream city. Melissa Finnegan kept paying, knocking her student loan debt balance down $10,000. The ongoing pause on federal student loan payments that began in March 2020 has changed some Minnesotans' lives for the better. It's given them room in their budgets to afford major purchases, get ahead on student loan payments and catch up on other debts.
