APThe United Nations headquarters building India at UNSC on Friday said that its approach to the Ukraine conflict will continue to be people-centric as New Delhi continues to support nations struck by a surge in food, fuel and fertilizers prices. "India's approach to the Ukraine conflict will continue to be people-centric. We're providing both humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and economic support to some of our neighbours in the Global South under economic distress even as they stare at the escalating costs of food, fuel and of fertilizers which has been a consequential fallout of the ongoing conflict," Ambassador R Ravindra, Deputy Permanent Representative at United Nations Security Council said at the UNSecurity Council briefing on Ukraine.
