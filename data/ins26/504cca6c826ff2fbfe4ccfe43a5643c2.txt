As we have seen, the unexpected arrival of Izzie (Bethan Moore) at Daniel and Zara's (Matthew Chambers and Elisabeth Dermot Walsh) home has caused a fair bit of turmoil recently. 
This week, Emma (Dido Miles) and Zara are discussing how Izzie isn't a big fan of school in the staff room when Izzie herself walks in. It is a school Inset Day and she wants money so that she can go shopping with Valerie (Sarah Moyle).
Izzie and Valerie try on various assorted tops and try on some makeup. With Valerie's full agreement, Izzie takes some pictures of this and posts them online.
