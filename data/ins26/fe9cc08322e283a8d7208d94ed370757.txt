Roy McGrath, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan's former chief of staff, is asking a federal judge to postpone his criminal trial, which is scheduled to begin Monday.

McGrath, also the former head of the government-owned nonprofit Maryland Environmental Service, is asking for the delay because he lives in Florida and, per an agreement with the prosecution, cannot look at discovery documents in the case while out of state, defense attorney Joe Murtha wrote in a letter to U.S. District Court Judge Deborah Boardman.
