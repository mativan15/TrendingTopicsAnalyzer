CONAKRY (Reuters) - At least three people were shot dead and many wounded at an anti-government protest in and around Guinea's capital Conakry on Thursday, an opposition coalition said.

It was at least the fourth deadly protest in Guinea since June, organised by groups that are calling on military leaders to restore constitutional order after seizing power in a coup last year.

The National Front for the Defence of the Constitution (FNDC), a coalition of politicians and activists, said three people had died from bullet wounds.
