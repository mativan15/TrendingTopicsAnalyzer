Business mentors supporting Rishi Sunak's £520 million management training scheme have reacted angrily to the decision to no longer pay them for their services.Alison Edgar, who was awarded an MBE for services to entrepreneurship and business in 2020, is among those calling for a rethink. 'I've never seen such exploitation of the knowledge economy in my life,' she said.Edgar previously had been paid to mentor three business owners taking part in the 'Help to Grow' management training provided by the University of the West of England in Bristol.
