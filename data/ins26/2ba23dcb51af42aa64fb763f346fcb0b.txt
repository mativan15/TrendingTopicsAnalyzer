AUSTIN — Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke have raised a combined total north of $160 million with three weeks still to go before the Nov. 8 election, and a handful of outside groups are adding millions more as they seek to influence the outcome.

Mothers Against Greg Abbott, a political action committee whose name is a takeoff on the Donald Trump-inspired acronym of MAGA, raised more than $1 million, almost $945,000 coming in from July through September, according to the most recent campaign finance reports filed with the Texas Ethics Commission.
