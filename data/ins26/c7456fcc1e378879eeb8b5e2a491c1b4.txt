If you're a 'Stranger Things' super fan, Vrbo has just the rental just for you. Located in sunny Albuquerque, the Byers family's home from the hit sci-fi series' fourth season is available to book this Halloween season and beyond.

The generous 4,000-square-foot space has five bedrooms, 10 beds and four bathrooms to comfortably house a large group of friends. In true 'Stranger Things' fashion, the interior is decked out with '70s and '80s decor to bring the small screen to life. The basement is even home to an assortment of nostalgic arcade games including air hockey, basketball and Pac-Man.
