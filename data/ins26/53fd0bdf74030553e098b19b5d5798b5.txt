Japan's Financial Services Agency has begun drills with about 160 financial institutions aimed at addressing cyberattacks against businesses and government offices. The week-long exercises started on Tuesday on the assumption that customer data had been leaked or crypto-assets stolen. The Director of the agency's Cyber Security Policy Office, Saito Tsuyoshi, said large-scale cyberattacks are taking place in and outside Japan, and the methods are becoming more sophisticated. He said he hopes the exercises will improve the response capabilities of all financial institutions.
