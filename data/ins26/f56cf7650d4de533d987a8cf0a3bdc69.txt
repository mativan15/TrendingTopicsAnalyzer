Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.02% said surgical procedure volumes are returning to pre-pandemic levels in many parts of the world, a trend that cheered Wall Street and could bode well for other medical-technology heavyweights like Stryker Corp. SYK, -1.54% and Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. ZBH, -1.48%. J&J, which reported earnings on Tuesday, said its medical-technology business had a 'strong September,' with U.S. sales of hip and knee implants and other surgical devices rising 7.7% to $3.3 billion in the third quarter of the year.
