(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin is regaining its dominance of the cryptocurrency universe.It now accounts for 44% of total crypto market value, the most since October, just before the latest bull market peaked, based on data from CoinGecko. Bitcoin's renewed hegemony is a reflection of how the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin earlier this month has ravaged smaller tokens like Avalanche and Solana. The largest cryptocurrecy was down about 1.5% on Friday, making it a relative safe haven compared with altcoins like Avalanche, which tumbled as much as 11%.
