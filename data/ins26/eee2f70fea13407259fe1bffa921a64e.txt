(RTTNews) - The manufacturing sector in South Korea continued to expand in May, albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from S&P Global revealed on Thursday with a manufacturing PMI score of 51.8.

That's down from 52.1 in April, although it remains above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

May data pointed to a second contraction in production levels in the past three months. While only mild overall, the rate of reduction was the strongest since last December.
