With starting tailback Christian McCaffrey out in Carolina, it's next man up on the depth chart.

D'Onta Foreman (pictured), signed as a free agent from the Titans earlier this year, becomes the starter. The new No. 2 will Chuba Hubbard.

Foreman has 12 carries for 37 yards in six games this season. Hubbard has six for 34 in six games.

Hubbard arrived as a fourth-round pick from Oklahoma State in 2021.
