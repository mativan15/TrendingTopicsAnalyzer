The chief of the Surrey Police Service and the board's executive director are both saying Mayor-elect Brenda Locke won't be able to deliver on her promise to keep the RCMP in the city. Despite a relatively narrow victory over incumbent Doug McCallum, Locke will be joined at city hall by a slate of four Surrey Connect councillors that will give the party a majority. After she was declared the winner Saturday evening, she reiterated her pledge to stop the already underway transition to a municipal police force.
