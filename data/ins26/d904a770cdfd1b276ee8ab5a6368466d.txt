In a bizarre twist to a hyped Chinese derby, PSG.LGD took a default win to go 2-0 against Group A leaders Royal Never Give Up (RNG) at The International 2022 (TI11) Group Stage Day 3 opening series.

PSG.LGD had shown great form in easily taking down RNG 32-9 in the first game in just 27 minutes, with their opponents putting up a lacklustre showing.

RNG's offlaner Yang "Chalice" Shenyi had a dismal first game on Jakiro, going 1/8/5, with the rest of the team not faring much better.
