The Delhi High Court has closed the proceedings on a petition concerning the implementation of certain provisions of a law banning unregulated deposit schemes. A bench headed by Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma noted the steps taken by the authorities concerned in pursuance of the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Act and opined that no further orders from the court were required on the public interest litigation by Abhijit Mishra. The court recorded that by a notification issued in September 2021, the Delhi government has appointed its Principal Secretary/Secretary (Revenue) as the "competent authority" under the Act and has also already framed the rules, which have been approved by the central government and are pending with the Reserve Bank of India.
