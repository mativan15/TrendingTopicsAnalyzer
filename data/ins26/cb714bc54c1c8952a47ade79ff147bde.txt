SOUTHERN PINES, N.C. — After three days of some of the lowest scoring in U.S. Women's Open history, a fight broke out at Pine Needles.

Challenging hole locations, an uptick in wind and the biggest purse in women's golf history finally brought things to a boil.

Only the battle wasn't at the top, as no one could mount a charge to challenge the elegant and unflappable Minjee Lee, who entered the final round with a three-stroke lead and finished at 13 under, four ahead of American Mina Harigae to claim her second major title.
