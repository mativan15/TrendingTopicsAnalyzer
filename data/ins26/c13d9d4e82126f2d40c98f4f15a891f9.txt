So many mixed feelings about the Barracuda Pro, Razer's wireless gaming-slash-lifestyle dual-wireless headset. It's designed for both PC and mobile gaming, with a 2.4GHz dongle and Bluetooth 5.2 support and a clean, boom-mic-free design. It includes new TriForce Bio-cellulose 50mm drivers with an integrated THX Achromatic Audio Amplifier, which deliver excellent sound. It's not particularly lightweight at 340 grams, but it is comfortable. I don't know that it's quite worth the price tag, though, unless it's on sale.
