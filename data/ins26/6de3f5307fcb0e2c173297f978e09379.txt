Kyrgyzstan's health minister, who recommended a poisonous root as a treatment for coronavirus, has been arrested following a corruption probe linked to the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines, according to prosecutors.
Alymkadyr Beishenaliyev has been nicknamed 'aconite' for promoting a homemade liquid solution based on the poisonous root, also known as wolfsbane, to cure coronavirus and other diseases.
Prosecutors said on Friday Beishenaliyev was involved in the purchase of more than two million coronavirus vaccine doses over national requirements, proceeds from which 'were transferred to offshore accounts'.
