I'm afraid for Newcastle fans they'll have to be more patient than that, even though Eddie Howe has done an outstanding job and exceeded expectations so far, going to Old Trafford on Sunday looking to break into the top six.I'd be gobsmacked if Newcastle are champions in under five years. For one thing, they were well behind Chelsea and even City were under new ownership.
