 Meghan Markle has revealed she has absolutely no intentions of venturing back into the world of acting… but if her children wanted to pursue careers in entertainment, she'd support them wholeheartedly. All the way back in 2018, a year before her lavish Windsor wedding to Prince Harry, Meghan appeared in her final episode of legal drama Suits, having played the role of Rachel Zane since its 2011 premiere.
