Attorney General Maura Healey will use proceeds from recent legal settlements to help patients in urgent need of mental health care avoid having to visit hospital emergency rooms.The $2.9 million grant program will hand out awards of up to $250,000 over a two-year period to non-profits to create, expand or sustain the mental health services they provide. The goal is to ease the crisis of mental health patients boarding, sometimes for days, in hospital emergency rooms as they wait for a psychiatric inpatient bed to become available.
