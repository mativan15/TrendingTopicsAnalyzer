The Arizona Cardinals face the Seattle Seahawks for the first of two games within four weeks Sunday afternoon on the road. Both teams enter Week 6 at 2-3 and lost their Week 5 game.

The Cardinals have struggled offensively early in games, failing to score in the first quarter in all five games this season. After six quarters of terrible play, the defense has been solid.

Meanwhile, the Seahawks have been rolling offensively with Geno Smith at quarterback, who is a full-time starter for the first time since 2014.
