Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams hit out at her opponent, incumbent Governor Brian Kemp, arguing the 'callous' and 'grotesque' Republican is causing unneeded harm and deaths in the state by refusing to expand Medicaid, a federal health programme for low-income people.'We've lost hospitals and we've lost lives,' Ms Abrams told Oprah Winfrey during an event on Thursday.
