Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says she made a mistake last year in predicting that inflation would be minimal or manageable. 'I think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,' Ms. Yellen told CNN on Tuesday. A once-promising fight against COVID-19 took a downward turn in mid-2021 as variants surged and producers struggled to shake off the pandemic and meet the demand for products. People who saved money or received federal payments continued to spend on goods instead of services, trips, conferences and other events, exacerbating the problem.
