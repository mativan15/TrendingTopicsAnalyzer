Believing that the timing is prescient, Punch Bowl Social founder Robert Thompson is getting back into the 'eatertainment' sector and launching a chain of food-and-drink-based pickleball facilities, with one of the first two spots set to open in Alabama in summer 2024.

Camp Pickle aims to take America's fastest-growing sport beyond the realm of tennis-club-like facilities and merge it with campfire-themed food, scratch-made cocktails and multiuse spaces where friends can play games and then gather around picnic tables to socialize.
