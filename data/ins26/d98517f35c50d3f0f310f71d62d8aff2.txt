A Muscogee County grand jury has refused to indict two people police charged in the 2008 cold-case murder of a 67-year-old Columbus man found bludgeoned, stabbed and shot in his home, where he'd been dead a week before his body was discovered.

Last year investigators charged Shanita Evette 'Cookie' Cannon, also known as Shanita Wyatt, and her associate, Emanuel Andre Holloway Sr., with murder and burglary in the death of Paul Hill Sr., whose body was found about 2 p.m. April 2, 2008, in a home at 3300 Marathon Drive.
