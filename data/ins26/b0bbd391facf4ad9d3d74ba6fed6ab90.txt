Neebing, Ont. — Curtis Coulson is well-rested going into his next term as the Municipality of Neebing (Pardee Township) incumbent councillor.

The retired factory worker, who will be entering his fourth term as the Pardee representative, recently arrived home from a month-long vacation that included an Alaskan cruise.

Coulson, as well as incumbent councillors Brian Kurikka (Scoble) and Gary Gardner (Pearson), ran unopposed and had their positions acclaimed.

The Neebing roads committee member said he decided to give council another shot because there's a few more things he'd like to see be accomplished.
