Eduardo Garcia is all in on lithium. As a state lawmaker representing some of California's poorest and most polluted areas, he's become a leading advocate for lithium recovery from the Salton Sea, a highly saline inland body of water in his Imperial Valley district.The region is a hotbed for geothermal energy production, and the process of extracting lithium from naturally occurring geothermal brine could be the cleanest method yet of capturing the critical mineral. The process uses less water and needs less land than other forms of lithium extraction.
