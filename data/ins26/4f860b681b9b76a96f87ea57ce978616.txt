The New York Giants have signed wide receiver Marcus Johnson from their practice squad to the active roster.

The 6-foot-1, 204-pound Johnson had been an elevation in each of the past two weeks and went on to start both games. He recorded five receptions for 60 yards over that span, but also dropped one touchdown.

Before joining the Giants in September, Johnson had spent time with the Philadelphia Eagles, Seattle Seahawks, Indianapolis Colts, Tennessee Titans and San Francisco 49ers.

The Giants still have one open spot remaining on their 53-man roster.
