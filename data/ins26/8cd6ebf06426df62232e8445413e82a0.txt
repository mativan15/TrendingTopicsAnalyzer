The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday moved the Delhi high court challenging the trial court's ruling that allowed Delhi minister Satyender Jain to have his lawyer present -- at a visible but not audible distance -- during Jain's interrogation in the money laundering case in which he was arrested on Monday.The matter was urgently mentioned before a bench of acting chief justice Vipin Sanghi and justice Sachin Datta by advocate Zoheb Hossain, appearing for the ED, who said 'grave prejudice' would be caused to the interrogation and subsequent investigation, in case the lawyer is allowed to remain present.
