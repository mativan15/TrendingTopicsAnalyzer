Longtime manufacturer of prismatic skylights Sunoptics has notified state employment officials that it will permanently close its Sacramento factory in December.

In a notice to the California Employment Development Department this week, Sunoptics said the layoffs would be completed by Dec. 9 at a cost of 98 jobs.

Sunoptics is a division of Atlanta-based Acuity Brands Inc. (NYSE: AYI), which bought Sunoptics in 2011. Following that deal, Acuity Brands and Sunoptics developed combined systems that used both electric lighting and skylights to provide indoor lighting offerings.
