A federal court has expunged a trademark registered by a Richmond, B.C. man, concluding that his only purpose for registering it was to extort money from a Chinese restaurant chain or profit off that chain's image. In a decision issued earlier this month in Toronto, Justice Angela Furlanetto ruled in favour of Beijing Judian Restaurant Co., which had applied to have the trademark registered by Wei Meng expunged. The company has operated a chain of barbecue restaurants in China since 2005, and had "close to 40" restaurants in operation in that country as of July 2020, according to court documents.
