Editor's note: Dream Getaways is a seasonal feature the Business Journal runs when the weather turns a bit nippy and Minnesotans think about where they could live, or vacation, in milder climes. Oftentimes, it'll be a luxury home in Florida or Arizona, like this week's feature, which is courtesy of the Tampa Business Journal.

A downtown Tampa penthouse once rented by NFL star Rob Gronkowski is on the market for $5.4 million.

The condominium, on the 28th floor of the Towers at Channelside, is 4,462 square feet with a 1,000-square-foot wraparound terrace.
