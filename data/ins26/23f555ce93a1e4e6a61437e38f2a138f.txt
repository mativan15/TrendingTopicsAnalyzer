4:29 PM ETCOLUMBUS, Ohio -- Jack Nicklaus said he met with the organizers of a Saudi Arabian-financed golf league but has no interest in being the face of a rival circuit to the PGA Tour."I did it out of courtesy to them because we're doing a golf course for them," Nicklaus said Tuesday during a news conference at the Memorial. "I've got zero interest in wanting to do something like that. I don't care what kind of money they would have thrown at me. My allegiance has been to the PGA Tour. I grew up on the PGA Tour.
