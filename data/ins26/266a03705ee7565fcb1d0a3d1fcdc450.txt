A woman was scammed out of £612,000 by two men pretending to be a doctor who was in love with her, a court heard.
The 60-year-old Swiss woman believed her online romance was with an English doctor living in London.
But she was actually communicating with James Olagbaiye, 47, and Adesola Adebayo, 38, flatmates from Newham, East London.
The pair sent her a photo of a fake British passport with an image of an older gentleman as part of the ruse, Southwark Crown Court heard.
The "doctor" claimed to have produced ventilation machines for the NHS to help in the fight against the Covid pandemic and sought the woman's money as a loan for this venture.
