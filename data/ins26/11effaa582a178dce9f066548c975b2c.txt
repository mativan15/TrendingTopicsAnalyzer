Harry Kane fired home from the penalty spot to boost Tottenham's Premier League title charge in a 2-0 win over Everton as struggling Leicester remain in relegation trouble after a 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace. England captain Kane broke the deadlock in London and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg doubled the lead late on as Spurs moved to within one point of leaders Arsenal. The turning point came just before the hour mark when referee Paul Tierney ruled that Kane had been brought down by Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and pointed to the spot.
