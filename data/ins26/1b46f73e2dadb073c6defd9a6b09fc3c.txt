Joe Willock relishes spending free hours walking his dog along Northumberland's seemingly endless miles of sandy beaches but, sometimes, the Newcastle midfielder's mind transports him to a very different world. The Caribbean island of Montserrat lies more than 4,000 miles from England's North Sea coast and a big part of Willock's future is tied up in its volcanic landscape.'My family have a lot of land out there and I want to build something in Montserrat to give opportunities to kids who don't have the chance to come to Europe and play football,' said the 23-year-old.
