Following his victory in the American Grand National, Hewick is a 33-1 shot to complete an unlikely 'rags to riches' racing story in the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March.The seven-year-old that cost just €850 when bought by trainer 'Shark' Hanlon secured his latest big pot when routing the opposition in Saturday night's $250,000 American Grand National in Far Hills, New Jersey.Afterwards, an emotional Hanlon paid tribute to Jack De Bromhead, the 13-year-old son of trainer Henry De Bromhead, who was killed in a fall while pony racing in Co.
