Australia has no longer decided to recognize West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, according to a Monday morning report by The Guardian.

In the report, the decision was reversed by the country's Labor government. The initial decision to recognize West Jerusalem as Israel's capital was made by former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has deleted two sentences from its website in the past few days after Morrison's decision, according to the report.
