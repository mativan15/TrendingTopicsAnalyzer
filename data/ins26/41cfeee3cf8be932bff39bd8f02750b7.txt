Maja Hitij/Getty Images News I understand that everybody is bearish right now: Everybody is bearish right now about the stock market (which is the reason we might move higher in the coming weeks). And everybody is particularly bearish about Europe and especially Germany. And without doubt, Germany is facing a challenging winter - probably from an economic standpoint and therefore also from a political standpoint. Keeping that in mind, the headline might sound outrageous. You might also point out me being wrong about Bayer AG (OTCPK:BAYZF) in my last article when I saw the stock as a buy about six months ago and it declined 34% in the meantime (about 25% when looking at the stock price in Euro).
