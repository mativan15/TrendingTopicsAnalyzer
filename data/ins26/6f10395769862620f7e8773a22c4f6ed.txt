LONDON — Liz Truss was not under a desk.

But the fact that a senior colleague had to confirm that to a raucous Parliament on Monday is a sign of just how badly things are going for Britain's prime minister.

Mired in a political and economic crisis of her own making, Truss has faced global ridicule, historically low public approval ratings and even an unfavorable comparison to a decomposing lettuce.

Having survived just over 40 days into the job, the question is how many more she has left.

Asked to come to the House of Commons to answer an urgent question on her decision to ditch her finance minister in a desperate bid to save her premiership and calm markets rattled by their tax cut plan, Truss instead dispatched a government minister.
