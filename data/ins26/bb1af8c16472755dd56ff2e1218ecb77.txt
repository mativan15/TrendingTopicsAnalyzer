AltaGas ALA-T (Friday's close $29.89) built a large bullish base in the shape of a 'W' pattern from 2018 to 2020 (dashed lines). It had a breakout from this formation in 2021, reached a high of $26.94 in August, 2021 (A) and then settled in a narrow horizontal trading range mostly between $24 and $27 for about six months (dotted lines). The recent rise above this range signalled a breakout and the start of an uptrend toward higher targets (B).Behaviour indicators including the rising 40wMA confirm the bullish status.
