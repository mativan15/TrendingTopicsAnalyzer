BIG UPS Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus Picks His Bandcamp Favorites By Ethan Beck · October 17, 2022 From the Abraham Lincoln quote that opens The Monitor's 'A More Perfect Union' to The Most Lamentable Tragedy's angelic choir on 'The Angry Hour,' Titus Andronicus always knows how to make an entrance. On the Patrick Stickles-led quartet's seventh album The Will to Live that hasn't changed.
