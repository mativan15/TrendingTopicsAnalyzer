SOUTHERN PINES, N.C. (AP) — Dottie Pepper recalls being paired with Meg Mallon for the final round of the 1991 U.S. Women's Open with what she viewed as an impressive $110,000 first-place prize on the line.Things have changed, but Lydia Ko says not enough.Mallon would win that tournament and earn the record-breaking payday.'It was the first time a winning check was six figures,' Pepper said. 'That was a big deal.'Pepper has a hard time believing that a little more than three decades later, the top female golfers in the world will be competing for a record $10 million purse, including a winner's share of $1.
