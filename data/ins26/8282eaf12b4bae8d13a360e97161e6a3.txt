Published: 05:04 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 05:12 EDT, 16 October 2022 Drake has once again put money on the line for this weekend's sporting action, laying a £537,000 (CA$833,333) bet on both Arsenal and Barcelona to come out on top on Sunday. The Canadian rapper could win over £2.5million (CA$3,900,002) should his wager come good, although he does have a checkered history when it comes to gambling. Although he won a staggering £3m backing both British MMA superstars Paddy Pimblett and Molly McCann earlier this year, he also lost £368k after Leon Edwards' shock UFC 278 knockout of Kamaru Usman.
