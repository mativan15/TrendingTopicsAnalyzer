(Reuters) -Australia's market regulator said on Monday it had commenced civil penalty proceedings against Australia and New Zealand Banking Group for allegedly misleading its customers over their credit card accounts.

About 165,750 ANZ clients were charged cash advance fees and interest for withdrawing or transferring money from their credit card accounts between May 2016 and November 2018, based on incorrect account balances, the regulator said in a statement.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said that in some cases, single customers were charged thousands of dollars in fees.
