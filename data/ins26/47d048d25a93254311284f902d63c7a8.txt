Kiké Hernández has started 45 games for the Red Sox this season, all in center field. It's the longest streak of games at one position in his career and it shows in how well he has played defensively.Through Saturday, Hernández had four defensive runs saved, tied for second among all center fielders. Jose Siri of the Astros was first with five.'He works at it. He's always looking for [scouting] information and trying to get better,' manager Alex Cora said Sunday before the Sox played the Baltimore Orioles.
