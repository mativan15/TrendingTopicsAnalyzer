A day after quitting as an MLA of the ruling Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT), Dhananjoy Tripura said he had resigned because the party was being run without a 'guardian', effectively questioning party supremo and minister N C Debbarma's leadership capabilities.
Dhananjoy, who had won the Raimavalley seat of Dhalai district with BJP support, said Saturday that he was not allowed to serve the interests of the tribals. Royal scion and TIPRA Motha chief Pradyot Kishore Manikya Debbarma is the only leader who can ensure justice to tribals, he said.
