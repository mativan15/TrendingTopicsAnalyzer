'January 6th was one of the most dramatic and consequential moments in our nation's history,' proclaimed Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS) as portrayed tonight on Saturday Night Live again by Kenan Thompson. 'So, to fight back, we assembled a team of monotone nerds to do a PowerPoint,' the longtime cast member added as fellow SNLers played Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and soon-to-be departing Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), the latter in the form of Heidi Gardner. Yep, with double duty by Megan Thee Stallion as host and musical guest, the third episode of SNL's 48th season kicked off with the January 6th Select Committee's unanimous October 13 vote to subpoena Donald Trump.
