VAT-free shopping in the UK is gone for good, it has been announced. It was scrapped after Brexit at the start of 2021 and then brought back. But the UK's Chancellor has now confirmed it will not return.

The perk made shopping in the country 20 per cent cheaper for international visitors. It allowed them to get a refund on value-added tax (VAT) on items bought in high street shops, at airports or at other departure points from the UK and exported in their own personal luggage.

When the UK left the EU in 2021, then Chancellor Rishi Sunak ended tax-free shopping.
