EA Sports, developer of FIFA 23, has invested $11million (£9.7million) in the UEFA Women's Champions League (UWCL) to invest in the future of the sport.
FIFA 23 features more female players than ever before, including all the players and clubs from the English Premier League and France's Ligue 1.

It will also release a Women's World Cup mode for the first time, to coincide with the real life event next summer.
FIFA 23 is the last game in the FIFA franchise developed by EA Sports, as the two companies will part ways following a dispute over licensing fees.
