Things are looking up for Netflix this quarter. The streamer added 2.41 million subscribers, bringing the total to 223.09 million. Netflix expected a net gain of 1 million subs in the third quarter, so today's results far exceed its own expectations and analysts' expectations. The company reported earning $7.93 billion in revenue in Q3 2022, whereas analysts predicted $7.85 billion.

This will be Netflix's first increase in a while, particularly in its U.S. and Canada subscriber base. The company reported a spike in 104,000 subscribers in the region, making the new total 73.
