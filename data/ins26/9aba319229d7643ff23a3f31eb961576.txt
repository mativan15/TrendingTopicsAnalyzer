'I am not going anywhere. I will live here and I will die here': This is a line that Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu, who liked being known as Sidhu Moose Wala, would repeat at every rally and every roadside meeting while campaigning for the Punjab Assembly elections held in February this year.
Moosewala, 27, was the only child of his parents. He was shot dead near Mansa, a day after his security was withdrawn.
 Sidhu Moose Wala was shot at least 10 times while he was in his car.
