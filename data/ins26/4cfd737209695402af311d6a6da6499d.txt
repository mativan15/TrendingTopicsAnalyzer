In her bid for a second full term as Illinois comptroller, Chicago Democrat Susana Mendoza faced the prospect of fending off a well-financed Republican challenger in McHenry County Auditor Shannon Teresi, who was part of a slate backed by billionaire Ken Griffin in the primary.

But Teresi and treasurer candidate Tom Demmer, who ran unopposed, were the only members of the slate to survive the primary, and Griffin left Illinois for Florida.

Teresi, 38, has since run a low-profile campaign in her bid to unseat Mendoza, attempting to tie her opponent to Democratic corruption while arguing that her financial credentials make her better suited for the relatively obscure state office, which oversees the state's checkbook.
