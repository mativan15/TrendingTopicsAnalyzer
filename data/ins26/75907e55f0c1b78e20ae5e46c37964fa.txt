More than a hundred of the best-known clothing companies in Australia aren't paying the workers who make their clothes enough money to afford the basics of human life on a living wage, despite the growing efforts from the fashion industry and consumers to make more ethical choices.A new ethical fashion report that surveyed 120 companies operating in Australia found just one in 10 paid workers in some or all of their factories a 'living wage'. Brands that scored a zero in the field included Industrie, Novo Shoes, Nine West, Wittner, Windsor Smith, Sheike and Shein.
