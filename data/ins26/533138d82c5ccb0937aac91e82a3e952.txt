It looks like BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 3 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase BlackRock's shares on or after the 3rd of June will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of June.
