Tesla's TSLA Q3 earnings on October 19 will provide essential insights into Tesla's outlook and its room for growth within the auto industry. The EV market is expected to post a 20% CAGR through 2030, as every major automaker races to catch up to Tesla.

The current market environment could certainly dent EV growth and slow the revolution. The gem of the Auto industry has almost unanimously been Tesla, and the company's growth alone affects the expansion of the Electric Vehicle market.

Trading 46% from its 52-week highs, investors will want to see if Tesla continued to see delivery growth during the quarter.
