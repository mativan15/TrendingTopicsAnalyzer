NAVI MUMBAI: Activists have alleged that there is an apparent discrimination while taking action against illegal bungalows or resorts in Alibaug and Murud areas along the coastal belt.They claimed that action to demolish illegal properties of political rivals and fugitive businessmen, such as Anil Parab, Nirav Modi etc, takes place quickly, but there are at least 100 such illegal bungalows where no government action has been done for nearly a decade despite serving the owners with notices.The activists added that since law for CRZ violations is the same for all citizens, uniform action must also take place against all illegal bungalows along this coastal belt so as to safeguard the environment.
