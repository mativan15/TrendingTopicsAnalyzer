Time to rummage through your drawers. A first generation iPhone sold for more than $60,000 over the weekend - almost 50 times its original price.

The winning bidder, who lives in Australia, paid an eye-watering US$39,339.60 (about $62,909) for the unopened 2007 device.

The 8GB iPhone was still in its original factory-sealed box, according to Louisiana-based auction house LCG Auctions, who said it was 'virtually flawless'.

'Collectors and investors would be hard pressed to find a superior example,' it said.
