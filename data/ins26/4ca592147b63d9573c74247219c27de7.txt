David Harbour has opened up about his experiences with mental illness which left him ‘in an institution' during his most difficult period.
The Stranger Things actor, 47, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 26 ‘after an episode that landed me in an institution', which he believes can be a common byproduct of living in poverty. 
David explained: ‘I have definitely been in and out of the system. And there were times in my life where very easily I could have ended up on the streets, but I luckily had a family who could.
