 British Prime Minister Liz Truss, who announced her resignation just 45 days into her premiership on Thursday, is eligible to receive up to $129,000 USD a year for the rest of her life. The taxpayer-funded allowance, otherwise known as the Public Duty Costs Allowance, was introduced by the government in 1991 to reimburse staff and salary costs incurred by former prime ministers "arising from their special position in public life." It comes after they leave office, does not support their private or parliamentary duties, and first took effect after Margaret Thatcher's resignation, per the BBC.
