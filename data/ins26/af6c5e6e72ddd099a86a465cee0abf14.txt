Recently, the sadly known, Henry Kissinger during an intervention via virtual at the World Economic Forum in Davos pointed out 'peace negotiations (between Russia and Ukraine) must begin in the next two months, before tensions develop that cannot be easily overcome. The ideal solution would be a return to the 'status quo ante'. Further continuation of the war at this point would not be freedom for Ukraine, but a new war against Russia.'
Evidently the reaction of the Ukrainian President Zelensky has been quite furious, in a message to the nation he accused Kissinger of 'coming out of the deep past and saying that Russia must have a piece of Ukraine' besides making to underline that this elderly politician lives in the year 1938 and not in 2022.
