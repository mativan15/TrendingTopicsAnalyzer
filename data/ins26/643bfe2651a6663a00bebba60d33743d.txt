A Quebec man has been arrested in relation to a 'grandparent' scam in Burlington where he allegedly tried to defraud his victim out of $9,000.

Halton Regional Police said in a press release that the 24-year-old man deceived the victim into believing their child was in police custody and needed to be bailed out.

Emergency or grandparent scams involve a victim receiving an unsolicited call regarding a loved one in distress. Police say fraudsters portray themselves as police officers, bailiffs or lawyer then scammers ask for a large sum of money for their release.
