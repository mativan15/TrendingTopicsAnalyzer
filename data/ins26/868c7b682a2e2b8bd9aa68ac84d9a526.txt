The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the OZ Minerals Limited (ASX:OZL) share price has soared 231% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. It's even up 4.3% in the last week.

After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals.
