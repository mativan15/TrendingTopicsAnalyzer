Details of new Big Brother series released before 2023 return

ITV has teased some major details of the new Big Brother series ahead of its reboot.

After a five-year hiatus, the broadcaster confirmed that the reality show would be getting a comeback as it finds a home on ITV2 and the new streaming platform ITVX next year.

Viewers will remember that the first programme started on Channel 4 in 2000 and stayed on there for 10 years before moving over to Channel 5 from 2011 to 2018.

The reboot will introduce a "new cast of carefully selected housemates, from all walks of life" as cameras catch their every move for up to six weeks, ITV has said.
