Jayde Adams is sailing through each week of Strictly Come Dancing with her partner Karen Hauer. They impressed the judges with their classy American Smooth at the weekend, and the duo are hoping to do the same on Saturday with a comedic Charleston. The award-winning comedian wouldn't be in the BBC series in the first place if it wasn't for her younger sister.Jayde Adams' sister Jenna died at the age of 23, as she was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour after having a seizure.The doctors were able to take more than 50 percent of the tumour during a biopsy, but thanks to the trauma, "she was different afterward", Adams told The Guardian.
