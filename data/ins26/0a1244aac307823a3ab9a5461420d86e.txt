Tech has played a major role in expanding the reach of services and schemes, and drones are fast becoming an integral part of this revolution, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday, reiterating his government's big bet on a new technology he said will lead to 'antyodaya' (welfare for all). Modi was addressing the opening session of the Bharat Drone Mahotsav, 2022 exhibition at Delhi's Pragati Maidan, where he said that a range of sectors from agriculture, to health care, to defence, to disaster management, to entertainment stand to benefit from these devices.
