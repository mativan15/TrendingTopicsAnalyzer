Oil prices opened mixed in early Asian trade on Thursday as investors balanced caution over tightening supply against lower demand projections. Brent crude futures for December settlement fell 28 cents, or 0.3 per cent, to $92.13 a barrel by 0010 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery (WTI), which expires on Thursday, rose 34 cents, or 0.4 per cent, to $85.89 per barrel. 
 In remarks Wednesday, US president Joe Biden said he plans to sell 15 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and repurchase oil if prices fall enough.
