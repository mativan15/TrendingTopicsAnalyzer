"LIC operates in slightly different segments than the other companies. The other private insurance companies are mostly very aggressive or very large in the non-participating products like ULIP or credit protection or personal protection and these are the high margin products. From yesterday's result, it does not seem that is getting aggressive in those areas," says Digant Haria, Co-Partner, GreenEdge Wealth.

LIC has seen an almost 18% drop when it comes to the bottom line. Premiums have gone up and the dividend has been announced.
