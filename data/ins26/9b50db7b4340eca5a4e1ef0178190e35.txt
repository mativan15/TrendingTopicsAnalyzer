Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis stood by his veto of $35 million in funding for a proposed Tampa Bay Rays spring training site after the team publicly pressed for new gun control measures.
Asked about the fiscal chin music at an unrelated press conference Friday, DeSantis said he didn't endorse routing taxpayer money to professional sports teams — especially those engaged in 'activism.'
'I don't support giving taxpayer dollars to professional sports stadiums,' he said. 'Companies are free to engage with or not engage with whatever discourse they want, but clearly, it's inappropriate to be doing tax dollars for professional sports stadiums.
