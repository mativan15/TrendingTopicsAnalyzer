The big shareholder groups in Tatton Asset Management plc (LON:TAM) have power over the company. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. Warren Buffett said that he likes "a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people." So it's nice to see some insider ownership, because it may suggest that management is owner-oriented.

With a market capitalization of UK£256m, Tatton Asset Management is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors.
