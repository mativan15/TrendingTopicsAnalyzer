By Denny Jacob Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. on Wednesday disclosed that it previously approved a plan that proposes to close a tire manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom. The Akron, Ohio, tire maker said the approved plan proposes to close a U.K. facility that was acquired in conjunction with a merger between the company and Cooper Tire & Rubber Co., according to a regulatory filing. The plan is intended to address long-standing competitiveness issues at the facility. The plan would consolidate Goodyear's premium motorcycle tire production in Europe into a single center based in a facility located in Montlucon, France; discontinue Cooper Tire's European motorsport program; and transfer light truck tire production to other tire manufacturing facilities in Europe from Montlucon.
