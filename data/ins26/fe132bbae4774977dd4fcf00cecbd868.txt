Caroline Dennett's eye was caught by a placard with two stark words: 'insiders wanted'. The safety consultant was watching a video of Extinction Rebellion climate protesters who had glued themselves inside Shell's headquarters in April and were encouraging employees to jump ship to aid its cause.This week Dennett, who runs the independent agency Clout, released a bombshell video severing ties with Shell after an 11-year business relationship. She emailed 1,400 Shell employees and accused the £177bn behemoth of causing 'extreme harms' to the environment and having a 'disregard for climate change risks'.
