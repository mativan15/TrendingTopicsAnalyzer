A 190-feet wide asteroid will soon be approaching the Earth, says NASA. Should you be concerned about an asteroid strike? Find out. After a brief spell of peace, large asteroids have begun swarming around Earth again. Earlier today, a 160-feet wide asteroid flew past the Earth and now, according to NASA, a larger 190-feet wide asteroid is going to approach Earth soon. The asteroid, which is larger than the Colosseum (157 feet) situated in Rome, will make its closest approach on June 8, 2022. While asteroids moving past the Earth is a regular occurrence, an asteroid this large is a matter of concern.
