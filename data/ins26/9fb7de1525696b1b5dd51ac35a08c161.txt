The Stocks and Shares ISA has been a wonderful invention for people like me. It allows me to grow my investments totally tax-free, and not have to worry about paying capital gains tax every year. Just as importantly, most of the income flowing into my account from dividend stocks also remains exempt from tax.

If I had a spare £5k to invest, I'd split it between out-of-favour stocks where the potential long-term returns could be much higher from today's prices.
