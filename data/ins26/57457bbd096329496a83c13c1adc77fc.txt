Investing.com-- Most Asian stock markets fell on Thursday with technology-heavy bourses leading losses after U.S. Treasury yields spiked overnight, although hopes of more stimulus measures in China helped limit declines.

China's benchmark Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes rose marginally. The People's Bank of China held its loan prime rate at accommodative levels on Thursday, reinforcing expectations that the government will roll out more spending measures to support the economy.
