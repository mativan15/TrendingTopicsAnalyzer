Georgia's Senatorial candidates, Herschel Walker and incumbent Raphael Warnock, faced off Friday night in what is likely to be the only debate between the two prior to the midterm elections.The one-hour debate started with a question on inflation and ended with the candidates discussing if they would support expanding the number of seats on the Supreme Court. Walker, who has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump, attacked Warnock for his history of supporting the Biden administration's policies, while Warnock painted his opponent as an extremist on issues like abortion.
