In the first quarter of Saturday's memorable game in Salt Lake City, Cam Rising didn't look very good. He threw an interception which was wiped away by a roughing-the-passer penalty. Later, he badly air-mailed a wide-open receiver on 3rd and 4. It was not the start Rising or Utah needed.Apparently, what Rising needed was to fall behind by 14 points and develop a level of urgency which had been missing in previous games this season. Utah had to win this game to stay in the Pac-12 race. After falling behind 14-0, Rising and his teammates knew there was zero margin for error.
