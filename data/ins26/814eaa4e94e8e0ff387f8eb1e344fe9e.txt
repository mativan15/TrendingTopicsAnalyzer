The most successful men's hockey program in Alberta Colleges Athletic Conference history has added an unlikely new player this season.
Rintaro Mashio grew up in Tokyo, Japan, where he also played hockey. Mashio developed into an accomplished player, but he quit the sport as a teenager after losing his passion.'Mostly my dad taught me about hockey,' he said. 'The reason why I quit hockey is my dad was a little bit too strict.'The 21-year-old moved from Tokyo to Edmonton earlier this year to study English at NAIT.
