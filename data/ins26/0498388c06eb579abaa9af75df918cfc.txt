The chief executive of Amazon's consumer business will step down next month after more than two decades, the e-commerce giant announced in a blog post Friday and reflected in a regulatory filing.'I've had an incredible time at Amazon but it's time for me to build again,' David Clark said in a tweet Friday, where he shared a screenshot of an email he sent to his team. 'For some time, I have discussed my intent to transition out of Amazon with my family and others close to me, but I wanted to ensure the teams were setup for success,' he wrote in the farewell email.
