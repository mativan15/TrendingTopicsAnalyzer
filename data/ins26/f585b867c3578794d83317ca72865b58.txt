After Sri Lanka, Bangladesh is now eyeing discounted Russian oil and has sought India's suggestion to avoid any sanctions while making purchases. Bangladesh Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen on Monday said he sought India's suggestion on how New Delhi is managing its oil purchase from Russia, while noting that the energy issue has become a challenge for Bangladesh.

Momen was speaking to reporters in Dhaka following his meeting with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar in Guwahati on Saturday, where both had travelled to participate at an event in India's Eastern and South Eastern neighbourhood.
