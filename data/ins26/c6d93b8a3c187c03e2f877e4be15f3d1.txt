If you're an older adult who likes reading plays, taking digital photos or studying the stars, to name just a few interests, join the club — specifically one of the more than 20 affinity groups organized by members of the Emeritus Students College of Marin, or ESCOM.

Founded in 1973, the free, volunteer-led program for adults over 55 also gives discounts to its members on select community education classes at College of Marin's campuses in Kentfield and Novato.
