New York City is boosting funding to public schools facing an influx of new students — including an estimated 6,100 migrant kids who've entered the system this school year. 
Department of Education Chancellor David Banks and officials, in a news conference on Tuesday, said cash was on its way to schools struggling with growing enrollment.
'We're quickly providing more funding to allow schools to step up,' said Banks at P.S. 16 in The Bronx, which is receiving dozens of migrant students.
DOE press secretary Nathaniel Styer later added in a tweet, 'We've provided $25 million directly to schools in response to new students enrolling, and there is more to come.
