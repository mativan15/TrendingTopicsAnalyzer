S﻿ammy James, Fulhamish, externalIt was not the result we were hoping for against Bournemouth on Saturday, but given the fact we were behind twice, a point is better than nothing.A big discussion among Fulham fans is our defending, which has been getting gradually more concerning for the past month. We have conceded at least twice in our past five fixtures and, while in some games there have been allowable circumstances such as suspect VAR calls or being down to 10 men, on Saturday there were no excuses.
