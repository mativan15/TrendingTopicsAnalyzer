Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon expected their time on Bachelor in Paradise season 8 to look a bit differently.

After the former Bachelor in Paradise couple's relationship was spotlighted on season 8 of the show, Ashley, 34, and Jared, 33, spoke about the unexpected backlash from fans — who said they felt the show was taking time from the Bachelor Nation singles who deserve it.

"It makes us feel like failures because the show took a chance with us, and we didn't ask for them to, but the fact that they wanted to means the world to us," Jared said in a conversation with Entertainment Tonight.
