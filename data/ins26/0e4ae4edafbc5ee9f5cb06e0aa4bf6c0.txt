Stocks were mixed in choppy trading on Friday as investors assessed more corporate earnings reports and the outlook for Federal Reserve rate hikes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 458 points, or 1.5%. The S&P 500 rose 1.3%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.1%. Treasury yields fell from their highs on Friday morning after a report from the Wall Street Journal that some Fed officials are concerned about overtightening with large rate hikes. That report appeared to boost equities as well. The central bank's aggressive rate hikes have been a major factor in stocks falling into a bear market this year, and traders have continued raising their estimates of where the Fed will stop.
