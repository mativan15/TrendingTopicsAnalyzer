It took forging company Bharat Forge 61 years to reach an annual turnover of Rs 10,000 crore. Chairman and MD Baba Kalyani is confident of the next Rs 10,000 crore coming at a faster pace, with the company set to double or triple turnover in the next 10 years.
Having joined the company started by his father Neelakanth Kalyani 50 years ago, Baba Kalyani, 73, says the past 10 years have been the busiest in his life. 'If you have a passion to do something then many things can be done,' he says as he completes 50 years at the helm of Bharat Forge.
