Kathy Hochul is ​sitting on legislation that would limit how she can leverage public dollars for her own political benefit – despite the ongoing concerns about alleged pay-to-play schemes with donors to her campaign for governor.
'Our oversight should be restored – and the sooner the better,' Comptroller Tom DiNapoli said Monday about getting Hochul's signature onto a bill passed in June that would require his office to sign off on billions more in spending each year.
'At a time when people are very concerned about every household dollar and every tax dollar, enabling the comptroller's office to do the job that it was set up to do [is] a very important message,' DiNapoli added.
