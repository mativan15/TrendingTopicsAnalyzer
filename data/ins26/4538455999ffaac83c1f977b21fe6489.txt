The Green Bay Packers will designate wide receiver Sammy Watkins for return from injured reserve, but his availability for Sunday's game against the Washington Commanders is currently unclear.

Coach Matt LaFleur said Watkins will practice with the team on Wednesday.

'Yeah, he'll be out there in a limited capacity,' LaFleur said.

Watkins has been on injured reserve with a hamstring injury over the last four weeks. During the first two games, he caught six passes for 111 yards.

In terms of playing this week, LaFleur wasn't sure.
