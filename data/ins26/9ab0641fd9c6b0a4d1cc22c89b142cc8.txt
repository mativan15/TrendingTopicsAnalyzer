Oct. 19—MOULTON — The Moulton City Council approved a 3% cost-of-living pay increase for full-time city employees this week after declining to support several motions for larger raises.

Officials said the approved increase will leave workers with raises totaling about 20% in the past five years.

The council on Monday also approved an overall fiscal 2023 budget of $11 million in revenue and $10.4 million in expenses.

Councilwoman Denise Lovett made a motion to give the employees an increase of one pay grade each, but the motion died after failing to receive a second from a fellow council member.
