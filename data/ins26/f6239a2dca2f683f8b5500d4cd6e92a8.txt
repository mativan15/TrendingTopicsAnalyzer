TV presenter Robert Rinder has criticised David Beckham for signing a £10million deal to become the face of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar.

The Judge Rinder and former Strictly Come Dancing star has stated he feels Beckham has put a price on his morals over his support for the upcoming games, set in a nation known for its discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community – with homosexuality convictions coming with a three-year prison sentence – and women.
