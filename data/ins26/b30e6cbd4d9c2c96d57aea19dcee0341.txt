Meghan begins the filmed interview by talking about her love for board games, saying: "Hi, I'm Meghan and I play a mean game of Scrabble, especially timed Scrabble."It's something that I've lived for a long time. I'm very good at Jeopardy, and I love to cook. I don't know if a lot of people know that, maybe they do. But I also make a really solid bolognese sauce."She continued: "I think within the industry what we can do to help pay it forward for the generation coming up next is really to implement policies that are going to help families within the industry be able to have the balance to take care of their families, and to be able to do their jobs.
