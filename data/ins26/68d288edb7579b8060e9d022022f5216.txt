Oct. 15—Debbie McElhenney was known to many as a Realtor in the Corsicana area and a long-time member of the Rice ISD Board of Trustees.

She died in August of last year after her years long fight with metastatic breast cancer.

"We all miss her wit, funny stories and her sweet smile," said friend and fellow Realtor and Broker Denise Harper of BrickStreet Realty Group.

As a way to honor Debbie, her friends and Realtors at BrickStreet Realty Group are assisting in two fundraisers: a gas voucher program and a scholarship for a Rice ISD Senior bound for college.
