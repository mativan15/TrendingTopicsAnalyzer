LOS ANGELES — For nearly a week, activists and elected officials have demanded the ouster of three Los Angeles City Council members, calling it the only acceptable response to secretly recorded audio of them engaged in a conversation with racist and derogatory language.But in and outside City Hall, some have begun discussing another, potentially more dramatic step to address the public's outrage in the wake of the scandal: scrapping the maps of the council's 15 districts and drawing new ones.The audio that sparked the uproar captured Councilmembers Nury Martinez, Gil Cedillo and Kevin de León talking about redistricting, the once-a-decade process of drawing new boundary lines for each council district.
