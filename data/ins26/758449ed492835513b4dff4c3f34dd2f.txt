David De Gea says it is 'unbelievable' to think he will become just the 11th player in Manchester United's history to make 500 appearances for the club when he lines up against Newcastle on Sunday.

The 31-year-old moved to Old Trafford from Atletico Madrid in 2011 and has won the Premier League, Europa League, FA Cup and EFL Cup, along with picking up numerous individuals awards.

There have been ups and downs during his De Gea's time at United, where he will reach a historic milestone this weekend when he starts against Newcastle at Old Trafford.
