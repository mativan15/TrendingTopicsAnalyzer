It's somehow already late October and over half of the college football regular season is in the books. While the Week 8 slate might not have the same intrigue as last week, there's still five ranked matchups on the schedule. What does the betting action look like ahead of the weekend?

Public, sharps aligned on UCLA

One of the best games of the weekend is in Eugene where Oregon is a 6-point favorite against an undefeated UCLA team.

UCLA is coming off a bye week. Prior to that, they defeated Washington and Utah in back-to-back weeks.
