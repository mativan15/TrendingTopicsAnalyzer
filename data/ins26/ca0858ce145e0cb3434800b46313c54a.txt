A 10-foot-long giant squid was recently found floating in the sea off the coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands. The stunningly preserved 440-pound behemoth was found by Teo Lucas, a naturalist and photographer, and taken to the Spanish Institute of Oceanography for further study."Most museum/research specimens come from the stomach contents of sperm whales or from specimens washed up on beaches and so are in very poor condition and often incomplete," Jon Ablett, senior curator of mollusks and cephalopods at the Natural History Museum in London, told Newsweek.
