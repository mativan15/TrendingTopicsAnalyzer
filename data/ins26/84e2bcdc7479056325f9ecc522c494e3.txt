It's a decades long border fight over where English-speaking Guyana ends and Spanish-speaking Venezuela begins, and now social media has been pulled into it.

Guyana, which is considered part of the 15-member Caribbean Community though it lies on the northern coast of South America, shouldering the Atlantic, is asking Facebook and Twitter to get its facts straight and remove what the government considers 'illegal maps' of the former British colony. The maps, say the country's office of foreign affairs, are being posted by Spanish-language media accounts and are claiming a large swath of Guyana for neighboring Venezuela.
