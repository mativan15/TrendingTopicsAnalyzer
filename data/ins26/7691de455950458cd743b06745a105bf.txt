Yamana Gold (AUY -3.24%) stock rocketed higher and closed the week up 8.8%, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
It wasn't gold prices driving the move. Gold did rebound a bit this week, but only momentarily, and its price has consistently declined since mid-April. But it looks as though Yamana Gold is getting acquired at a healthy premium.
So what
On May 31, Yamana Gold and South Africa-based gold miner, Gold Fields (GFI -4.15%) announced that they had entered an agreement where the latter will acquire Yamana Gold in an all-stock deal.
