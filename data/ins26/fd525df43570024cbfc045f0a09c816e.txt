UK inflation has reached 10.1 percent, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced today. The ONS found the rate increased to five times the target in September, driven by surging gas and electricity bills and a jump in food and drink costs. And it is a 40-year high, with the rise from 9.9 percent matching the rate authorities recorded in July this year.High inflation throws uncertainty over UK finances, with benefits and pensions hanging in the balance given their reliance on the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
