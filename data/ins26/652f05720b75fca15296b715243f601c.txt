Two-time European Cup winner Nottingham Forest is back in the top flight of English soccer for the first time since 1999.
Forest beat Huddersfield 1-0 in the Championship playoff final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday to secure its return to the English Premier League next season.
The most lucrative match in soccer — it's worth 170 million pounds ($215 million) in future broadcast money and guaranteed earnings — was settled by an own-goal by Huddersfield defender Levi Colwill just before halftime.https://images.
