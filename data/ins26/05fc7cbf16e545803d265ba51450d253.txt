The far-right politicians Kim Moon-soo (pictured, left), chairman of the Economic, Social and Labor Council, and Hwang Kyo-ahn (right), former leader of the United Future Party, have returned to the People Power Party (PPP). The PPP is criticizing the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye and starting an anti-Communist debate calling for nuclear armament, using the security crisis as an excuse. The ruling PPP no longer has a force centered on former leader Lee Jun-seok to keep it in check, while President Yoon Suk-yeol's approval ratings remain low.
