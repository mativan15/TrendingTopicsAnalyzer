Antoine Griezmann fired Atletico Madrid to a valuable 1-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday and reached 100 LaLiga goals for the club in the process.

Atletico announced on Monday that Griezmann's loan return from Barcelona was being made permanent, and the France forward marked his first league appearance since with a composed second-half finish.

Alvaro Morata had earlier been denied an opener by a VAR review, but Griezmann's effort proved enough for coach Diego Simeone's men during a typically disciplined display.
