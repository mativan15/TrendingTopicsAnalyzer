The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) is recommending that programs offered to improve Indigenous participation in the Alberta economy should include feedback from the Indigenous communities or organizations that receive the funding.

Earlier this week, the OAG released a report entitled Indigenous Economic Participation, in which it examined four programs offered by Indigenous Relations and two programs offered by Labour and Immigration.

The aim of the programs is to meet the goal set by the Alberta government in 2000 to 'support Aboriginal People and governments in achieving self-reliance and enhanced well-being.
