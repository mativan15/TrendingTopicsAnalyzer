Liam Condon, the new chief executive of Johnson Matthey, is obviously a superb salesman. The initial response to the company's announcement of a £217 million annual loss and strategy update last week was to knock 248p, or 10.5 per cent, off the share price.

Johnson is a complex business with many moving parts, compounded by the volatility inherent in operations relying on metals and minerals.
