Darren415/iStock via Getty Images Turning Point Brands, Inc. (NYSE:TPB) shares have been crushed over the past year falling from the $50s into the high $20s. That underperformance is due to a number of factors. To start, the most obvious has been declining NewGen product sales due to the PACT Act, which was updated in 2021. In fact, Q1 NewGen sales were down 37% year-over-year, specifically due to lower vape sales. Although Zig-Zag and Stoker's have been steadily growing, we can see the top line overall is unchanged in the last 18 months: Data by YCharts Total sales could remain under pressure for the time being.
