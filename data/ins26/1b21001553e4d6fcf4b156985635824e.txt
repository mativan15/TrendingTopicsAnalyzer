The Archives will host a six-month teaching fellowship, to be held virtually between October 14, 2022, and April 21, 2023.  This fellowship, funded by a digital art history grant from the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, seeks to foster new forms of research and collaboration as well as new approaches to teaching and learning.
Our cohort will develop a syllabus and assignment that centers the Archives' digitized primary sources—letters, diaries, photographs, financial records, inventories, sketchbooks, and the like from the 19th to the 21st century—available on the Archives' website.
