Indian authorities have asked a court to quash Pernod Ricard's bid to halt proceedings related to a $244 million tax demand, accusing the French spirit giant of being a "habitual litigant" and conspiring to "defraud" the government, legal documents show.The Oct. 3 Mumbai court filing by India's customs authority, which has not been reported previously, underlines the growing dispute between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government and Pernod's local unit over how the company valued some of its imports for over a decade.
