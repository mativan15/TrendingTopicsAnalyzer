Jones has 4.0 tackles for loss and 2.0 sacks through six games this season, but the Ducks have only allowed one sack all year.

UCLA football edge rusher Carl Jones spoke to reporters following Tuesday morning's practice session at Wasserman Football Center. Jones talked about his first impressions of scouting Oregon, how to deal with a mobile quarterback like Bo Nix, what he thinks goes into leadership, the Bruins' culture off the field and how much he enjoys playing for a winning team.
