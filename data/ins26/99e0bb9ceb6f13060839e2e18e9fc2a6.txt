Oct. 21—Hawaii's unemployment rate plunged in September to 3.5 %, its lowest level since before the pandemic, as the state grew its nonagricultural payroll ranks by 2, 700 from the previous month.

Question : Previously, the state said people who were receiving their tax rebate by paper check would get it by the end of October. Is that still on track ? I haven't gotten a check yet, and neither have my parents.

Answer : No, full delivery has been pushed back several weeks. However, the state does have the check stock it needs to print Act 115 rebate checks in large batches, and at least 20, 000 checks are expected to be mailed out today, said Nicki Ann Thompson, taxation serv ­ices administrator for the state Department of Taxation, who thanked Hawaii taxpayers for their patience.
