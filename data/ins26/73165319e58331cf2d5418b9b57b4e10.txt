October 21, 2022 09:01 AM Eastern Daylight Time MISSISSAUGA, Ontario--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CertainTeed Canada Inc. welcomes the Canadian International Trade Tribunal's decision to maintain anti-dumping measures for drywall in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, as well as the Yukon and Northwest Territories for another five years.

In an expiry review issued yesterday, the CITT found that U.S. drywall dumping will cause material injury to the domestic western Canadian drywall industry if current anti-dumping measures are not maintained.
