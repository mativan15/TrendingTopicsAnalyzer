Social media companies can continue to censor posts.That's the upshot of this week's Supreme Court ruling, blocking a controversial Texas law that bars large social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter from removing posts based on the viewpoints expressed by individuals and organizations. The justices were largely divided with a 5-4 decision in an ideologically scrambled vote, with three of the courts conservatives and two liberals putting the law on hold. The majority did not explain the reasoning behind its brief order but Justice Samuel Alito, in his dissent, notes the importance of social media platforms as a means for public discourse.
