May 27—The Alaska Legislature has included $200 million in funding in the capital budget to help rebuild the Port of Alaska.

That's a third of the hefty $600 million state funding request made by Anchorage Mayor Dave Bronson and the Assembly in the city's 2022 funding priorities, which Bronson and some Assembly members had lobbied for in Juneau.

The $200 million would go toward the $1.1 billion cost of replacing the port's cargo docks. The entire Port of Alaska modernization project, which will take about 10 years, is estimated to cost a total of $1.
