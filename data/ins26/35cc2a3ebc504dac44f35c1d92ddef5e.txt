CLEVELAND — Clay Holmes finally got back in a game. After 24 hours of controversy because he stood in the bullpen watching the Yankees collapse in the ninth inning of Game 3 of the American League Division Series, Holmes pitched around a walk for a clean eighth inning in the Bombers' 4-2 win over the Guardians in Game 4 Sunday night.

After Aaron Boone said he couldn't use Holmes in back-to-back situations because he was coming off a shoulder capsule strain, the reliever said he was not told he was not available.
