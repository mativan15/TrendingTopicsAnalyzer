Anton Kelly, 11, has been sanctioned as he has dual Russian and British nationality

The parents of an 11-year-old boy who has dual Russian and British nationality have been barred from automatically adding money to their son's savings because of sanctions against Vladimir Putin's regime.

Anton Kelly has had £25 added to his junior Isa by direct debit, held with Fidelity International, every month since he was born.

However, in April, two months after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, his father, Allan, 53, received a letter from Fidelity saying that due to EU sanctions against Russia 'you will no longer be able to trade as you normally would in investments denominated in any official EU member state currencies'.
