El Dorado will get to tackle Sylvan Hill's triple-option offense this week. Tackling will be the key for the Wildcats against the Bears' run-oriented offense.'The key defensively is going to be tackling, specifically in the open field,' said El Dorado coach Steven Jones. 'Some of their bigger plays this year have been on tosses and option pitches outside. They do run well between the tackles but they have speed and they can get out in space. Tackling in space is going to be key and not letting them string together those long drives.
