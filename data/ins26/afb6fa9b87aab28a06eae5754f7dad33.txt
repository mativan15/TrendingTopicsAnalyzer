LONDON (Reuters) - British Conservative lawmaker Wendy Morton, the member of the government responsible for enforcing Conservative Party discipline, and her deputy remain in post, Prime Minister Liz Truss's office said on Wednesday, after reports they had quit.

Truss's office said "Chief and deputy chief whip remain in post," referring to Morton and her colleague Craig Whittaker, after reports they had left government during a chaotic evening of quarrelling in parliament over a vote on fracking.
