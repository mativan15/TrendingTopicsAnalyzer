Simon ConwayOct 18, 2022Last night on PBS Governor Kim Reynolds and challenger Deidre DeJear faced off in Iowa's Gubernatorial debate. Some of the highlights included the Governor more than once saying how proud she is of her record of cutting taxes and looking after State finances while creating a surplus. A clash came when DeJear said politicians should not have a place in abortion decisions. 'My personal belief has no place in a woman's doctor's appointment when she goes into that doctor to make a decision that's in her best interest,' she said.
