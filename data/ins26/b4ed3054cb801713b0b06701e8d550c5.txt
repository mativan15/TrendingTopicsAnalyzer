There were a number of things weighing on Dwyane Wade during his and Team USA's gold medal performance in the 2008 Olympics, which is chronicled in the new Netflix documentary, 'The Redeem Team.' 
'It was a crazy time,' Wade told The Post during a private screening at CultureCon NYC. 'I was going through a lot in my personal life. It's like, 2006, and I'm at the top of the mountain screaming by myself.
'And then 2007, I got injured and then I'm going through a divorce and it just all started snowballing and a snowball started rolling downhill fast for me.
