If you thought the iPhone 14 Pro was too expensive for you, then you'd be shocked to know how much this iPhone sold for.
 Apple iPhones have always been priced at a premium, starting at hundreds of dollars for even the cheapest variants. Apple has recently launched its iPhone 14 series which starts at $799 and goes all the way up to a hefty $1099 for the iPhone 14 Pro Max. However, even that amount is pennies when compared to a recent auction of an unopened, original iPhone. The original iPhone was launched with a price tag of $599 back in 2007.
