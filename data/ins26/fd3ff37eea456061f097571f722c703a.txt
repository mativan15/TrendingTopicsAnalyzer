A group led by South Jersey power broker George Norcross, former TD Bank U.S. CEO Greg Braca and Parker McKay CEO Philip Norcross has fired off a letter to the board of directors dated Oct. 20 demanding that the bank investigate and bring claims against certain executives and directors, including interim Chairman and CEO Harry Madonna and his board allies, for a 'failure to provide timely financial and other reports.
