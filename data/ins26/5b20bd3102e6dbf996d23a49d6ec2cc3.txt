A New Zealand grandmother has converted a 29-year-old wreck into a homemade, solar-powered electric vehicle, 'to show it can be done'.Rosemary Penwarden, 63, has been driving her converted vehicle around South Island roads for three years now. The project took her and a friend more than eight months of solid work and tinkering. 'You do have to be a little bit mad,' she said. 'I want to thank the oil companies for the motivation.'Penwarden bought a 1993 car body from a wrecker's, and took the combustion engine out herself.
