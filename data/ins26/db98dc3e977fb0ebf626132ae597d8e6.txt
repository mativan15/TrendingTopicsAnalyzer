Recent studies show that self-driving cars will be commonplace around 2020. The same can be said for robot assistance in homes and at work. Machine learning makes these technologies possible by allowing them to adapt to their environment and learn from past experiences.Also, more and more devices are being equipped with computer chips that allow them to analyze situations and make decisions. For example, smart cameras have been built into TVs and laptop computers. They check back regularly and report anything they detect beyond what people already know — like if there's someone standing behind you further than your maximum distance.
