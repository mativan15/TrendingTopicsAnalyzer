A former employee of a bank in Montgomery County abused her position as head teller to steal $32,800, a federal grand jury has charged.

Jamie Leanne Hightower was indicted Thursday on charges of bank fraud and identity theft.

The indictment says that when the alleged thefts occurred in 2019, Hightower was head teller and vault teller at the Community Trust Bank in Mt. Sterling.

The indictment alleges that Hightower used various methods to take money, including altering documentation on customer deposits.
