LOS ANGELES — Rick Caruso had a bad primary night and a rough summer as he faced off against Democratic Rep. Karen Bass to be the next mayor of LA. But he's having a good fall. Caruso has erased a double-digit deficit with Bass in the final weeks of the most expensive mayor's contest in city history. The billionaire shopping mall developer, who has spent tens of millions from his personal fortune in his first run for political office, is in a tight race with the veteran politician, according to at least one recent poll and political analysts.
