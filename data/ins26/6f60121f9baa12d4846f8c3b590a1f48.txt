Bayern Munich has once again announced a positive financial year. Germany's biggest club announced a turnover of €665.7 million ($647.13m) and a profit before tax of €17.1m ($16.2m), up from last year's profit of €5m ($4.86m). The financial result means that Bayern remains the only club in the Bundesliga to make a profit in all three years affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
