ABBEY NECHANICKY

Nechanicky is living up to her standing as one of the nation's elite runners.

A senior, she won the Lake Conference girls' championship in record fashion Thursday at Gale Woods Farm in Minnetrista. She covered the 5K course in 16 minutes, 51.95 seconds, breaking the course record by more than four seconds. It was her second sub-17-minute time of the year.

"Abbey's goal is to learn something from each race this season and to enjoy the journey with her team," Wayzata coach Addy Hallen said.
