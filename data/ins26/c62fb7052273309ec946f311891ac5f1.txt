This TikTok toddler is hilariously uninterested in playing soccer with the rest of her team!

Connor Moore (@thatdimplebaby) is a mom and TikToker whose toddler daughter, Madsen, is far from a sports fanatic. Madsen loves fashion and playing dress-up with her mom, but couldn't work up much excitement when her parents had her join a soccer league. In a hilarious video, Connor shared footage of Madsen acting increasingly unenthusiastic about playing soccer over the course of 8 weeks.

The video begins with a shot of Madsen, after 8 weeks of soccer, being handed a trophy by her coach.
