Oct. 18—A search was underway Monday for the wreckage of a small plane that crashed Sunday afternoon west of Cordova, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

The pilot, whose name was not released, took off from Yakutat and was headed for Birchwood Airport north of Anchorage in a Piper PA-32 when the plane crashed in a mountainous area about 5 miles from Cordova around 2:30 p.m., said Clint Johnson, the agency's Alaska chief.

No passengers were believed to be on the plane.

Johnson said Monday that officials had not yet confirmed the pilot's death because they have not been able to reach the crash site.
