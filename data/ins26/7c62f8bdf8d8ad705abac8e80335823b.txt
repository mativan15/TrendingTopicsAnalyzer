Welcome to your five-minute recap of the trading day, and how the experts saw it.

The numbers: A strong lead from Wall St triggered a broad market rally on the ASX 200 which closed at its high point for the day, up 1.45 per cent to 7,286.6. Every sector finished the day higher aside from the utilities sector which appeared to take a hit from AGL's failed attempt to demerge its coal power plants from the rest of its business.

The tech sector led the gains with a rise of 4.6 per cent, followed by the materials sector with our iron ore and gold miners doing well.
