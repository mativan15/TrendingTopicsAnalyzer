Directors at tech firms SolarWinds, DynaTrace, Skillsoft, and Udemy have resigned after the US Department of Justice raised concerns about overlapping board membership it felt created antitrust problems.
The DoJ on Wednesday announced the resignations and explained they were made after it contacted companies it felt may have violated Section 8 of the Clayton Act – a statute that prevents one person from serving as a director or officer of two competing corporations.
"Competitors sharing officers or directors further concentrates power and creates the opportunity to exchange competitively sensitive information and facilitate coordination – all to the detriment of the economy and the American public," said assistant attorney general Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, adding that the Division "is undertaking an extensive review of interlocking directorates across the entire economy and will enforce the law.
