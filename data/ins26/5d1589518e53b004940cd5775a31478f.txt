Search engine giant Google on Friday called the ₹1,337.76 crore fine imposed by Competition Commission of India a ‘major setback for Indian consumers and businesses'. The tech behemoth said it would review the decision to evaluate next steps, Reuters reported. On Thursday, the anti-trust watchdog ordered Google to pay a ₹1,337.76 crore fine for ‘abusing its dominant position' in multiple markets in the Android ecosystem. The CCI noted that Google ‘perpetuated' its dominant position in the online search market thereby resulting in the denial of market access for competing search apps in contravention of Section 4(2)(e) of the Competition Act, 2002.
