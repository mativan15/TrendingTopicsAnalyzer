4:54 PM ETCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Carolina Panthers quarterback Sam Darnold returned to practice Wednesday for the first time in almost eight weeks sporting a full red beard and a left ankle healed enough to give him another shot at starting in the next couple of weeks.But whether he gets a second chance to start after losing the job to Baker Mayfield in training camp or remains the backup, Darnold's priority is to help a team that is 1-5 this season and the loser of 12 of the last 13 games find a way to win.
