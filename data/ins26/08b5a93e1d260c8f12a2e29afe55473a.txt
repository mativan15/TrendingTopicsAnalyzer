Playing Daniel LaRusso in 'The Karate Kid' made Ralph Macchio famous for life. For decades, people have been telling him where they were when they saw the 1984 popcorn flick or how its underdog story affected them.

Such all-encompassing fame, however, came with a downside.

As he tried to move on in his acting career, he couldn't quite leave the role behind. Sometimes, he said, he even felt stifled by it, no longer the freewheeling but vulnerable 22-year-old whose character in the movie learned the importance of balance, in life and in martial arts.
