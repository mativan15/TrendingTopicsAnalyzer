Two tickets — including one sold in Fort Myers, which was devastated by Hurricane Ian — have been deemed winners following Friday's Mega Millions drawing.
 
Both tickets matched all six numbers — 9, 22, 26, 41 and 44 for white balls, and a gold Mega Ball of 19 — selected in the drawing for the massive jackpot, according to lottery officials.
 
The Fort Myers ticket was a Quick Pick purchased at a 7-Eleven on Colonial Boulevard, local lottery officials said in a press release on Monday.
 
The second ticket was purchased at the 7-Eleven on Kooser Road in San Jose, according to a Tweet from the California State Lottery.
