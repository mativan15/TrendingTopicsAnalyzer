So that only leaves one option for your speculative investor: property. I was thinking about this as I watched two very different takes on the property business, series two of Gentleman Jack on iPlayer and Stath Lets Flats on All 4 (which I never saw when it stormed the world in 2018, a mistake that I started rectifying two weeks ago when its co-creator and star Jamie Demetriou won yet another Bafta). Ha! See how I watch everything at a time of my own choosing, Radio 4!
I love Suranne Jones as Anne Lister, her stompy walk and little glances moving the story onward like songs in a musical.
