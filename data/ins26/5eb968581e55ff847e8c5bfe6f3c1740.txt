Te Papa's acquisitions budget has not been increased for two decades but the Government says it has no plans to raise it despite high inflation and a progressively costly art market. The national museum found itself bidding against private collectors in a recent auction of the Bank of New Zealand's former art collection, spending $627,000 of this year's $3 million acquisition budget – a figure that's been stagnant since 2000 – on two artworks. But Associate Arts Minister Kiri Allan said she had no plans to consider increasing Te Papa's acquisition budget.
