Air New Zealand is doing away with seat-only fare options for services to Western Australia as well as two other mid-haul routes.

From Thursday, October 20, passengers to Perth and Tahiti will no longer be able to opt in for the budget seat and 7kg carry-on luggage option.

Instead the economy fare options will be streamlined to 'The Works', including meal and check-in luggage allowance.

And from the end of the month, flights to Honolulu will no longer offer a carry-on only option, to 'bring it in line' with the other North American destinations – offering only economy, premium economy and business cabin classes, New Zealand Herald reports.
