Futurama voice actor John DiMaggio revealed he got respect but no more money after his salary standoff with Disney and Hulu last winter, a dispute he dubbed #bendergate.
DiMaggio, who plays Bender, the show's degenerate robot, made the revelation to attendees at Phoenix Fan Fusion last week.
'People are like, ‘I'm so glad you got more money!'' DiMaggio said according to Slashfilm, 'I didn't get more money. But what I did get was a lot of respect, and a lot of head nods from people who are like, ‘Yo bro, I see you and thank you'' for, he says, shining a light on how critically underpaid voice actors are.
