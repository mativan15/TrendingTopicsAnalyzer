SAN JOSE — Santana Row — whose foot traffic and visitor levels now top those the destination center enjoyed prior to the coronavirus outbreak — has landed a fresh crop of merchants, the mall said Monday.
The new merchants include a mix of shops and restaurants that have recently opened, will open by year's end, or have openings scheduled for sometime in 2023, Santana Row said.
YETI, which is known for its tumblers, coolers, bags and drinkware, has leased space in Santana Row, the center said. YETI signed its lease over the weekend.
