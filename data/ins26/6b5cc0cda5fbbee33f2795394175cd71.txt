The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. For example, the Mandalay Resources Corporation (TSE:MND) share price has soared 298% in the last three years. Most would be happy with that. Then again, the 9.1% share price decline hasn't been so fun for shareholders.
