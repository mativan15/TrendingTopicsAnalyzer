pixelfitWhen we buy stock, we are buying fractional shares in a business. I like to look at the earnings yield of the business, as though I own the whole thing. If I told you, that for just over $8B, you could buy a business that has generated $5.86B of net income over the last 3 years, would you at least be interested in learning more? That is the case with Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY) and I believe it represents an extraordinary buying opportunity for the long-term investor. Short-term headwinds absolutely will lead to a bit of degradation in net interest margins and earnings, but the company should remain robustly profitable with an excellent opportunity to grow earnings and return capital to shareholders.
