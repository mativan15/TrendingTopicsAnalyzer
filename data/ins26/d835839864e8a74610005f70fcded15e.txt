"Canadians want to see guns off their streets," says Liberal MP Irek Kusmierczyk. (Jacob Barker/CBC)Windsor—Tecumseh Liberal MP Irek Kusmierczyk stood outside a Windsor bowling alley where five people were shot earlier this spring to promote the Liberals' new plan to crack down on handguns — one he called the most significant in a generation. "Canadians want to see guns off their streets," he said on Tuesday. "Canadians want to see guns out of their neighbourhoods."The legislation the federal government tabled Monday — nearly a week after a Texas school shooter killed 21 people — includes a national freeze on the purchase, sale, importation and transfer of handguns in Canada.
