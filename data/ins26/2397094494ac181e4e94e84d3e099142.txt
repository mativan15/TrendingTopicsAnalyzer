simarts Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) ADSs fell 1.1% in Thursday afternoon trading after Bloomberg reported that the Swiss bank is exploring issuing convertible bonds or preferred shares to pay for its restructuring and to shore up its balance sheet. Selling convertible bonds could help the bank limit the sale of its shares at its currently depressed prices. In the past year, Credit Suisse (CS) ADSs have lost more than 50% of their value, as the company continues to struggle with the aftermath of scandals and the collapses of Archegos Capital and Greensill Capital.
