Halloween ended with the release of the latest film in the popular horror franchise, but one fan wasn't happy – so not happy, they've taken action.
The film concludes the trilogy, directed by David Gordon Green, that aimed to bring back Michael Myers (James Jude Courtney) and Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) several generations after the masked villain's original killing spree.
However, the latest installment has divided fans with some applauding the conclusion to the series, and others wishing it had gone in a different direction.
