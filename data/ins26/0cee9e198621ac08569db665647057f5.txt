Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed a bill on Friday requiring political nonprofits to disclose their spending ahead of an election.

"It requires more detailed reporting by PACs and candidates, and it also requires more disclosures of conflicts of interest by government officials," said Deborah Fisher, executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government.

SB 1005 requires that when nonprofits use a candidate's name or image, they must disclose expenditures of more than $5,000 that take place within 60 days of an election.
