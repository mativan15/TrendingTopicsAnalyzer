J.D. Vance, an Ohio Republican in a tight U.S. Senate race against Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, indicated he would support the bipartisan push to ban members of Congress from trading stocks, in an interview with MarketWatch. Answering five questions from MarketWatch, Vance, a venture capitalist and author of the memoir 'Hillbilly Elegy,' also reiterated his support of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the landmark 1973 abortion-rights decision in Roe v. Wade and his criticism of President Joe Biden's move to cancel $10,000 in federal student debt per borrower (or $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients).
