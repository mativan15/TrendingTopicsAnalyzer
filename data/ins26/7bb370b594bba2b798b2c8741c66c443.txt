Dimitrios Kambouris Thesis Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors are likely still nursing their wounds after seeing the world's leading EV maker's stock fall back to re-test its May lows, as we posited in a post-Q2 update (Sell rating). We had urged investors to capitalize on the rally toward its August highs to cut exposure, as we postulated that the market was setting up TSLA for a steeper decline. Accordingly, TSLA has underperformed the S&P significantly since our update, losing more than 25%, compared to the S&P 500 ETF's (SPY) 12.
