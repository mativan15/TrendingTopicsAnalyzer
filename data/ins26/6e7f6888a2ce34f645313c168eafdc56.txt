Maisie Smith well and truly celebrated her victory on Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins in style.
The former EastEnders actress was among the famous faces competing on the brutal Channel 4 reality show this year, alongside the likes of Ashley Cain, Amber Gill, and Jennifer Ellison.
During the series, 14 celebrity recruits were put through their paces by the taskmasters, including chief instructor Rudy Reyes, and they all gradually dropped out when the going got tough before only four were left standing for Sunday night's final.
