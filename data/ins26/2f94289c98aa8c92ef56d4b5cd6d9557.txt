HP Inc. posted another strong quarter of personal computer sales and raised its earnings outlook Tuesday, sending its shares up 2% immediately in after-hours trading. 'We continue to deliver consistent results despite a volatile macro environment,' HP Chief Executive Enrique Lores told MarketWatch in an interview before the results were announced. To that end, HP raised its fiscal 2022 earnings guidance to between $4.24 and $4.38 a share while continuing toward its goal of reducing structural costs by $1.
