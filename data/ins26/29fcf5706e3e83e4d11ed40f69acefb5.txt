What qualifies you to hold this position? As a former police officer and 20-year nonprofit human services professional, I'm in a unique position to represent our district from a true service perspective. I'll stand firm for our community, put politics aside, and find common ground at the State Capitol. This is who I am at my core. I listen to understand, and I live to serve with integrity.

What would your top priorities be if elected? Public safety and disability services are my top priorities.
