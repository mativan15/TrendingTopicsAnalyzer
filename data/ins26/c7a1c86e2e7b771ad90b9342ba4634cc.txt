Jun. 2—BEVERLY — One customer was a traveling nurse from Tewksbury who planned to use a renovated school bus to stay in as she traveled to different assignments during the height of the pandemic.

Another customer was a senior citizen in Florida hoping to supplement his retirement income with a small concession stand.

And one was a Michigan woman with multiple myeloma, forced to retire early and awash in medical debt, who wanted to sell doughnuts from a cart to help offset the bills not covered by Medicare.
