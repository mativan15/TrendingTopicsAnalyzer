Damien Chazelle's Hollywood epic 'Babylon' will open in theaters across the country on Dec. 23. Paramount initially planned to debut the movie in select theaters on Dec. 25 before expanding it nationwide on Jan. 6. Sources close to 'Babylon' suggest the earlier release date points to the studio's confidence in the film, which carries a $78 million production budget. The news comes the day after Sony amended release plans for 'A Man Called Otto,' starring Tom Hanks, which was supposed to debut nationwide on Dec.
