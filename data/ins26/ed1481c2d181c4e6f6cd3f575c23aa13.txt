Britain's decision to delay the purchase of 14 Chinook helicopters to save money will actually cost taxpayers £300 million because they will be more expensive later, an official report has found, amid warnings of a 'worrying inability to control costs'.
The National Audit Office (NAO) accused the Ministry of Defence of 'complacency' in its budgeting as civil servants try to save money in the short term by pushing back the purchase of equipment into later years.
Rising inflation means that delaying the delivery of 14 RAF Chinooks from Boeing by three years will cost £295 million more than if they had been bought last year as planned.
