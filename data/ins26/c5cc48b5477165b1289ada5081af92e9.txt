Whoopi Goldberg is on the case of Meghan Markle, after the Duchess of Sussex revealed that she felt "objectified" during her time as a briefcase-opening assistant on season 2 of Howie Mandel's NBC game show Deal or No Deal.

"On that show, you basically had a suitcase and they wanted to know: Is this the deal you want, or is this not the deal you want?" Goldberg said on Wednesday's episode of The View, following Markle's comments about quitting the competition series on her Archetypes With Meghan podcast.
