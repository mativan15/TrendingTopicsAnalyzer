This week, Finance Secretary Kate Forbes outlined indicative spending plans for the remainder of the parliamentary term, with a focus on increased funding for health and social security. Michael Matheson said on Friday the Government face a 'challenging' fiscal situation due to rising inflation and energy prices increasing the cost of living, adding that they will 'redouble our focus on efficiency, structural change and collaboration'.
