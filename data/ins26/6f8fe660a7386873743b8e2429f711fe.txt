LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Fred Hoiberg enters his fourth season at Nebraska needing to produce if he plans on getting a fifth.'I feel pressure every day in my life,' Hoiberg said. 'You know, it's just what comes with this job.'Hoiberg was one of the nation's splashy coaching hires in 2019, but the Cornhuskers have only regressed. His predecessor, Tim Miles, never finished last in the Big Ten. The Huskers have been at the bottom three straight years and are picked to be there again this season.The 24 wins under Hoiberg are fewest among Power Five teams the last three years and the Huskers have three straight 20-loss records after never having had any in 123 previous seasons.
