The EU is reportedly planning to vote in favor of a landmark regulation that will mandate the adoption of USB-C for smartphones and tablets, forcing Apple to drop the Lightning port on iPhones. According to a Reuters report, EU lawmakers and delegates are set to meet at an event on June 7. During that meeting, the proposal for universally adopting the USB-C port will be agreed upon as the unified standard for all phones and tablets sold in the region.
'The trilogue next Tuesday will be the second and likely the final one between EU countries and EU lawmakers on the topic,' says the report, hinting that the remarkable manifesto will finally get the approval and get enacted as law.
