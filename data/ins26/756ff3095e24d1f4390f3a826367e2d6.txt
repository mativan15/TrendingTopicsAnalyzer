Oct. 15—HUNTSVILLE — Sam Houston football is nearly halfway done with its shortened 2021 football season. The Kats are playing a nine-game schedule after Lamar University and the University of Incarnate Word opted out of the Western Athletic Conference after the schedule was released.

The Kats have played two road games, but thus far they have all been via a bus. This week that is different, Sam Houston will travel 954 miles to Richmond, Ky., for its upcoming game against Eastern Kentucky University.
