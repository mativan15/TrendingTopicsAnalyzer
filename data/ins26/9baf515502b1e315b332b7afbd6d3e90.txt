The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took a major step Wednesday toward ensuring that kids who are uninsured can receive Covid-19 vaccines for free after the federal government shifts its immunization program to the commercial market.

The CDC's independent advisors voted unanimously on Wednesday to include Covid shots authorized for kids by the Food and Drug Administration in the federal government's Vaccines For Children program.

The Vaccines for Children program provides vaccines to kids under age 19 whose families cannot afford them.
