Rishi Sunak has said cost of living support delivering hundreds of pounds to every household will have a "minimal impact" on inflation - and suggested those who do not need it could give the money to charity.The chancellor told Sky News that the announcement of new measures worth £15bn to ease the burden on squeezed households was "targeted at those most in need".
Under the plans, every home will see £400 knocked off their energy bills - an upgrade from a previous policy of loaning them £200 to be repaid over five years - while eight million of the most vulnerable will also receive £650.
