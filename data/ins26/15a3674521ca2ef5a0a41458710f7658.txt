A day before the state-level senior office bearers' conference, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati has made it clear to the party leaders that national coordinator Akash Anand will be second in command in the party. The name of Akash Anand figured at the second place in the list of BSP's star campaigners for the Himachal Pradesh assembly election released by the party on Friday. The names party's national vice-president Anand Kumar and national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra do not figure in the list of the 40-star campaigners that the BSP has submitted to the Election Commission of India.
