By Reuters Published: 23:43 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 23:43 EDT, 30 May 2022 By Scott Murdoch HONG KONG, May 31 (Reuters) - Asian insurer FWD Group has delayed its $1 billion Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) because of volatile financial markets, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. FWD declined to comment. The sources could not be named as the information was not yet made public. FWD has a business presence in 10 markets in Asia. The insurer, controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Richard Li, had planned to list in the United States last year to raise $2-$3 billion but switched back to Hong Kong after regulatory approval was delayed.
