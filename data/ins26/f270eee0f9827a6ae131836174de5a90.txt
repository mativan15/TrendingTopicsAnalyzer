Greta Thunberg has revealed she makes no income from her work as a climate activist.

The 19-year-old – who has built a reputation for challenging world leaders on their environmental policies, became the youngest Time Person of the Year in 2019, and has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for three consecutive years – said her only form of income is the student grant she receives for going to university.

Thunberg, from Sweden, will published a new book later this month that compiles information from experts across the world on how we can tackle the climate crisis.
