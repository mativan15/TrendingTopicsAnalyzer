A Russian journalist who protested the Ukraine war during a live broadcast has reportedly escaped from house arrest and fled the country, according to her lawyer.

Dmitry Zakhvatov told Reuters that his client, Marina Ovsyannikova, is now "under the protection of a European state." He would not disclose where Ovsyannikova ended up after fleeing since "it may turn out to be a problem" for her.

Ovsyannikova's daughter left the country with her, but her son remained in Russia, Zakhvatov said.

"Soon everything will be made public.
