Zambia's Anti-Corruption Commission has opened an investigation into an alleged payment made by Glencore, the London-listed trading house, to an unnamed political party. The probe in the southern African nation is the latest headache for Glencore, which has been trying to turn over a fresh leaf under new chief executive Gary Nagle. The Swiss-based trading house was convicted of bribery and market manipulation in May following US, UK and Brazilian investigations, and has set aside $1.5bn to pay those fines.
