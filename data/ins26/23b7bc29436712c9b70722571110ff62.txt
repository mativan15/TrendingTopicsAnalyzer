The Seahawks defense has struggled in the past few weeks, and frustration among the players was becoming palpable. It appears they took out those frustrations on a shockingly overmatched Cardinals team which looked lost practically all afternoon.
Arizona started the game with a 76-yard opening drive which was capped off by a field goal and did nothing the remainder of the game. The Cardinals' subsequent possessions included four punts, two outright turnovers on downs, a fumble and an interception.
