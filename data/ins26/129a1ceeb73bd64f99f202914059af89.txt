Further negotiations are taking place over how the guarantee will work, with some of it to apply to debt provided by the African Development Bank, said people familiar with the matter, asking not to be identified as the talks aren't public.

The guarantee is part of a larger $8.5 billion funding package proposed by the UK, US, Germany, France and the European Union.
