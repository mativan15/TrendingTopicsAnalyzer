NEW YORK — After breaking into the mainstream of the investment world, ESG investing has become big enough to be a political target too.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Republicans around the country are criticizing funds that consider environmental, social and corporate-governance issues before deciding whether to invest in a stock or a bond. They call it "woke" behavior gone amok.

For years, the ESG acronym was a term known only within the investment world. Supporters say using such a lens to scrutinize potential investments can uncover risky companies with stock prices that are too high, or reveal investment opportunities underappreciated by Wall Street.
