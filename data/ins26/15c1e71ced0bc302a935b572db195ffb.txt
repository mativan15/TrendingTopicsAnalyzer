SAN JOSE – The San Jose Sharks might get top-line forward Alexander Barabanov back from injured reserve Tuesday when they open a four-game road trip against the New York Islanders.
Sharks coach David Quinn will take any help he can get, especially after seeing his team score just six goals in four games. But he also doesn't want to let everyone else off the hook for what's been one of the worst starts in franchise history.
'As much as it's going to be great to have him, the 22 guys we have here, they've got to look in the mirror and just be a little bit better,' Quinn said of Barabanov after the Sharks' 5-2 loss to the rebuilding Chicago Blackhawks on Saturday.
