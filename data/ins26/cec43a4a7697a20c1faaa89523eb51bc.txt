A GOP congressional candidate from Ohio who is accused of embellishing his U.S. Air Force record was also misrepresenting his academic credentials as recently as last month, archived pages from his campaign site show.

Donald Trump-endorsed Republican J.R. Majewski and his spokesperson both chalked it up to a minor mistake, and blamed the media for unfair scrutiny since an Associated Press investigation revealed that Majewski gave misleading accounts of his military and career backgrounds.
