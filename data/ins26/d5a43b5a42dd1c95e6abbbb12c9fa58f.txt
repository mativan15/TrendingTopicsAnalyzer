Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed the suggestion that Donald Trump could have stopped Russia from invading his country in an interview with Newsmax.Speaking on Tuesday with anchor Rob Schmitt, the Ukrainian leader said he 'cannot predict' what would have happened if Mr Trump was still US president. Schmitt proposed: 'There are many Americans that believe that if somebody like Donald Trump was still in the White House that this invasion would not have happened. What is your position?''I am sorry if I'll be saying something that you don't like but for us as the country in war, it doesn't matter whether it's Democrats or Republicans,' Mr Zelensky replied.
