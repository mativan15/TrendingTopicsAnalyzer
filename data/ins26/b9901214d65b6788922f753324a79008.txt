(New York) – The Sri Lankan government should withdraw a draft law that would give the authorities broad powers to detain people in military-run 'rehabilitation' centers, placing them at great risk of abuse, Human Rights Watch said today. The Bureau of Rehabilitation Bill, submitted to parliament on September 23, 2022, would allow the compulsory detention in centers of 'drug dependant persons, ex-combatants, members of violent extremist groups and any other group of persons.' The Bureau of Rehabilitation Bill would establish a new administrative structure controlled by the Defense Ministry to operate 'rehabilitation' centers staffed by military personnel.
