A group of MPs and peers have written to the English Football League demanding it end its long partnership with Sky Bet following the revelation clubs have been taking a cut of the money fans lose with the bookmaker.
The letter, addressed to EFL chairman Rick Parry, described the recent disclosure as the 'final straw in a relationship that has clearly gone too far' and called for him to take 'immediate action' to stop the practice.
Under Sky Bet's title sponsorship of the Championship, League One and League Two, clubs were entitled to a share of their supporters' losses as part of an 'affiliate partnership' with the bookmaker.
