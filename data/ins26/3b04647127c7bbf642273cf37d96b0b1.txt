British mortgage costs keep climbing, even after Chancellor Jeremy Hunt scrapped most of a controversial economic plan that had sent home loan rates to their highest in over a decade.

The average two-year fixed-rate home loan jumped to 6.53% on Tuesday, rising further above the 14-year high reached last week, according to Moneyfacts Group Plc. The average five-year fixed-rate deal climbed to 6.36% after breaching 6% for the first time since 2008 a fortnight ago.
