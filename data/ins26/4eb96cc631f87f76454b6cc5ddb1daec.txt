De'Andre Hunter and the Atlanta Hawks have agreed to a four-year, $95 million contract extension. The deal was agreed to shortly before the Monday deadline. Hunter, the 4th overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft, becomes the 11th player from that draft class to sign an extension this offseason, joining Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, RJ Barrett, Darius Garland, Tyler Herro, Brandon Clarke, Nassir Little, Jordan Poole, Keldon Johnson and Kevin Porter Jr. Hunter averaged 13.4 points in 53 games last season for Atlanta, along with shooting a career-best 37.
