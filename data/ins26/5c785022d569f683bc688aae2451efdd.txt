The US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) yesterday released a new toolkit to help hospitals improve antibiotic use in ambulatory care.Centered around AHRQ's Four Moments of Antibiotic Decision Making framework, the toolkit aims to improve antibiotic prescribing in settings like doctor's offices and urgent care clinics—where most antibiotics are prescribed and where unnecessary antibiotic use is common—using online presentations, guidelines, and other educational tools. The focus is on helping ambulatory care practices develop and strengthen their antibiotic stewardship infrastructure, providing strategies for communicating with patients about antibiotic prescribing, and teaching best practices for diagnosing and managing common infectious syndromes.
