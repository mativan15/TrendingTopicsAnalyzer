A Long Island motorist was arrested for allegedly fatally striking a mother of five while driving with a learner's permit before fleeing the scene in Hauppauge last month, cops said.
Madeline Henriquez, 23, of Brentwood, was driving eastbound on Motor Parkway when she collided with another vehicle at the intersection of Moreland Road around 10:15 p.m. on May 23, according to the Suffolk County Police Department.
Henriquez's 2012 Hyundai jumped the curb and hit 28-year-old Cherokee Fletcher, who was standing on the sidewalk, cops said.
