CoffeeAndMilk One of my biggest regrets has always been not pulling the trigger on acquiring some Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA) shares when the stock made its first appearance on my personal radar in early 2019. At the time the stock was enjoying years of overperformance thanks to steady growth and a resilient business model. Since then, I argue that the company is even in a better shape, having navigated more than successfully the terribly confusing COVID restrictions. Today the stock is in the enviable position to be basically flat YTD, in a year when the S&P 500 (SPY) is down over 25% and the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) is down over 35%.
