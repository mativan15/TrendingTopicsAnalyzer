A day after declaring she was 'not a quitter,' British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced she is stepping down as leader of the UK Conservative party.Her resignation will give way next week to the fifth Conservative leader since the party won government in 2010.A right-wing, free marketeer, Truss was undone by one of her first acts in office, a $50-billion mini-budget designed to kick-start the country's economy by cutting taxes, most notably for Britain's wealthiest. But financial markets revolted at the plan, and Truss was forced to scrap the economic measures as well as Kwasi Kwarteng, her chancellor of the Exchequer, in favour of a more measured approach under a new minister, Jeremy Hunt.
