The Dallas Cowboys are disappointed with Sunday's 26-17 against the Philadelphia Eagles as they should be.

No loss is ever acceptable.

And while the game may have finally showed the world Cooper Rush's shortcomings with his questionable arm strength in a three-interception performance, the facts are that the Cowboys backup quarterback did his job.

He did what backups are supposed to do: win games, keep the team in contention and the season afloat until the starter returns to the lineup.

And that time appears to be now for franchise quarterback Dak Prescott, who plans to return to the field for Sunday's game against the Detroit Lions after missing the last five games with a fractured thumb, suffered in the season-opening loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
