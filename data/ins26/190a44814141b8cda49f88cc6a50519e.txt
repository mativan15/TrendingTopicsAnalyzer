Unveiling the changes, Mr Hunt told MPs: 'The central responsibility of any government is to do what is necessary for economic growth.
'We are a country that funds our promises and pays our debts and when that is questioned, as it has been, this Government will take the difficult decisions necessary to ensure there is trust and confidence in our national finances.
'That means decisions of eye-watering difficulty. But I give the House and the public this assurance – every single one of those decisions, whether reductions in spending or increases in tax, will be shaped through core compassionate conservative values that will prioritise the needs of the most vulnerable.
