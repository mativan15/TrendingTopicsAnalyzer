The Polish government is drawing up plans for an emergency fundraising as more than 3.5m Ukrainian refugees put its public finances under massive strain.
Special debt to prevent chaos in public services is to be issued next year under proposals to ease the pressure being considered in Warsaw.
The Polish government hopes to tap the boom in demand for "ethical" investments by issuing so-called social bonds that have a lower interest rate, the head of the Warsaw Stock Exchange told The Telegraph.
Discussions have been held between the Polish government and the stock exchange over a bond sale and the debt will be a similar offering to green bonds issued by governments.
