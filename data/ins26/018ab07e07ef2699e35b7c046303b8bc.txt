LOS ANGELES — Two years ago, some of Los Angeles' political leaders took a public stand against the clout wielded by the city's police union, announcing they would reject any campaign donations that were offered by the group.In the days after the killing of George Floyd, Councilman Mike Bonin — elected twice with the union's support — said he would disavow any additional outside spending made by the union on his behalf. Councilman David Ryu, then seeking reelection, returned one of the union's donations.
