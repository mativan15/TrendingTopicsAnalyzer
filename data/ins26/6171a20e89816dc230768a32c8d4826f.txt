Oct 16 (Reuters) - Liverpool ignited their Premier League season as Mohamed Salah's late goal earned them a stormy 1-0 win over Manchester City to leave Arsenal four points clear at the top on Sunday.Salah, fresh from his quickfire hat-trick in midweek against Rangers in the Champions League, latched onto a long clearance by goalkeeper Allison in the 76th minute and fired into the net to inflict a first defeat of the season on champions City.City, who could have gone 16 points clear of their hosts with a win, had a Phil Foden goal disallowed, while Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp was shown a red card for remonstrating with a linesman after a tackle on Salah.
