Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) are headed for a collision next year on spending more money to help Ukraine.

McConnell has led Republican support for sending generous military and financial aid to Kyiv, warning that Russian President Vladimir Putin could threaten Poland and other European allies if not stopped in Ukraine.

McCarthy, who would become Speaker if Republicans win control of the House, is putting the brakes on more Ukraine aid, warning this week there won't be a 'blank check' from a GOP majority.
