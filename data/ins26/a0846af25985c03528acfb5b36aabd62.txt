SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun 2, 2022--Statement by Adam Pomeroy:'When I announced my campaign for Utah County Attorney, I did so as a first-hand witness to David Leavitt's failed vision, failed policies, and failed leadership.'Today, and especially after recent events, I am more convinced than ever of the need for a change in leadership. Something is rotten with the state of the Utah County Attorney's Office.'Four years ago, Mr. Leavitt vowed to radically reform the criminal justice system or to fail trying.
