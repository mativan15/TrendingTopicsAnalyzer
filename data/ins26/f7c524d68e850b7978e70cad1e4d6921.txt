Once again, this was a short-lived stint in the red as the Dividend Harvesting Portfolio finished week 65 in the black once again. Over the course of 65 weeks, I have allocated $6,500 in capital, and when the markets closed on Friday, the portfolio value was $6,793.74. In 2022, I have collected $122.
