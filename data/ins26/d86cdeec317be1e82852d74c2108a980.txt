One of the most useful polls I have covered during my time at The Washington Post was an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll released in 2015. It determined that the two most positively viewed political organizations in the United States were Planned Parenthood and the National Rifle Association.There was a catch, of course: Neither was viewed positively by a majority of the country. Each was viewed very positively by one political party and negatively by the other. They were poles of polarization, in other words: One hated by the left and loved by the right, and the other flipped.
