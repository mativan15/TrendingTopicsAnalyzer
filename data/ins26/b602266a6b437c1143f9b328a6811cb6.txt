Key Points

The specific drugs that a plan covers can change from year to year, as well as their cost, which makes it worthwhile to make sure there's not a better plan for you.
Additionally, some Medicare-related provisions in the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act take effect next year and will reduce what beneficiaries pay for certain drugs.
If you get coverage through a standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, you generally cannot change your selection after open enrollment ends Dec.
