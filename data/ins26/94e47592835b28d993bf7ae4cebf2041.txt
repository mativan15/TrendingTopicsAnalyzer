Barring any 11th hour surprises, Sarah Jama will be the new face of the New Democratic Party for the provincial riding of Hamilton Centre in a few weeks.

Jama is the only approved candidate set to be on the ballot at a riding nomination meeting on Nov. 3. She is set to replace longtime riding MPP and former NDP leader Andrea Horwath who stepped down to run for mayor in Hamilton.

'There are definitely big shoes to fill here. But I'm really excited to have the chance to focus on talking about health care and the impacts on people who are living here in Hamilton as well as housing and homelessness,' Jama said Monday.
