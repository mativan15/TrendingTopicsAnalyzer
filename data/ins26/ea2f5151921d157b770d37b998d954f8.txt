When India sent an official delegation to Kabul earlier this week, it was the first time that New Delhi signalled that it wanted a formal engagement with the Taliban.
With this, it appears that the Indian foreign and security establishment is less divided about the need to engage formally with the Taliban and prevent getting marginalised in a country that New Delhi sees as vital to its strategic interests in the region, and where the people's affection for India is legendary.
Although recognition of the Taliban government is not on the cards yet, Thursday's visit may have paved the way for the reopening of the Indian embassy, albeit a downgraded one.
