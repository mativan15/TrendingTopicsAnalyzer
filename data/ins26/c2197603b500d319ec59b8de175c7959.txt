Energy theft reports have soared amid climbing gas and electricity prices as winter looms. As a result of soaring international gas prices due to supply-side constraints sparked by Russia's war in Ukraine and gas cuts to Europe, UK billpayers are now having to fork out double the amount they were paying last year. And with surging inflation, the cost-of-living crisis is putting even further strain on households, many of which are now facing fuel poverty. Although Prime Minister Liz Truss's invention with the energy price guarantee knocked £1,000 off the planned October price cap for typical households, the standard family have still had to pay £500 more for annual bills since October.
