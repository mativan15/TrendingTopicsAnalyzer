Warner Bros. Pictures dropped the official red band trailer for the film 'House Party,' a raunchy, genre-bending comedy adventure co-produced by basketball legend LeBron James. Starring actors Jacob Latimore and Tosin Cole, the trailer gives glimpses at some of the hilarity and mayhem to come in the upcoming release, including a scene where the duo find themselves in James' house, talking to a hologram the athlete created to shower him in words of affirmation. 'He got a hologram of himself, just to give him compliments?' Latimore quips in the trailer.
