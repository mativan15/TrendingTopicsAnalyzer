Finally, Forbes has revealed the much-awaited list of the Top 100 Richest Indians for 2022. Forbes mentioned that, on the one hand, India's post-pandemic demand revival powered its economy to become the fifth-largest in the world, surpassing the U.K. On the other hand, the stock market has been down marginally from a year ago, with the biggest dampener being the weakening Rupee, which fell 10% over the same period. Despite this, the combined wealth of India's 100 richest grew by $25 billion to touch $800 billion.
