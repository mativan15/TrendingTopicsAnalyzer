The UK will bring in sweeping audit reforms aimed at reining in the dominance of the Big Four accountancy firms and cleaning up the industry following a string of high-profile scandals. The government said on Tuesday that it will replace the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) with a new watchdog that will be given tougher enforcement powers and be funded by an industry levy.The widely awaited overhaul comes after legislators and practitioners promised to improve audit quality following a series of high-profile missteps such as the collapse of Carillion in 2018 and the BHS failure in 2016.
