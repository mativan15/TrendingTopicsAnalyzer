British inflation jumped back above 10% in September on soaring food prices, official data showed Wednesday, October 19, with the country gripped by a cost-of-living crisis. The Consumer Prices Index accelerated to 10.1% on an annual basis, up from 9.9% in August, the Office for National Statistics said in a statement. The September rate matched the level in July and is the highest in 40 years as a result also of sky-high energy bills. "I understand that families across the country are struggling with rising prices and higher energy bills," Britain's new finance minister Jeremy Hunt said in a separate statement.
