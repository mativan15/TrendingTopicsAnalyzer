China has begun talking to ten nations in the South Pacific with an offer to help them improve their network infrastructure, cyber security, digital forensics and other capabilities – all with the help of Chinese tech vendors.
Newswire Reuters broke the news of China's ambitions after seeing a draft agreement that China's foreign minister Wang Yi is reportedly tabling on a tour of Pacific nations this week and next.
The draft agreement proposes assistance with data governance, training local police, and mapping the marine environment.
