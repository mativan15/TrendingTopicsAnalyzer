David Trood/DigitalVision via Getty Images Boot Barn Holdings (NYSE:BOOT +0.1%) offers a big opportunity to investors after a recent selloff, according to Baird analyst Jonathan Komp. Despite a big earnings beat reported earlier in May, shares of the Irvine, California-based western-wear retailer have slid sharply. Since the start of May, shares have slipped over 14%. According to Komp, this decline has been overdone and has created an attractive entry point for a retail stock with 'structurally higher' sales and profits.
