Oct. 19—EBENSBURG — A year has passed since Cambria County Emergency Management Agency coordinator and 911 director Art Martynuska appeared before the county commissioners and controller Ed Cernic for his annual budget request, but some things remained the same.

Once again, Martynuska appeared before the group asking for funds to replace a hazmat vehicle from 1994. Martynuska said that while the vehicle only has 20,000 miles, repairs are extensive due to the age of the vehicle.

Last year, Martynuska requested funds for a lease of a foam truck and the hazmat vehicle, but funds for only one of the vehicles was granted.
