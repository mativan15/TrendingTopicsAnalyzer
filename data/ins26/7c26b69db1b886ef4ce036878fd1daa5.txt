The UW edge rusher comes up with a pair of sacks in an offensive-minded game.

Tackler. Sacker. Blocker. Father.

The world for Jeremiah Martin got a little crazy over a 72-hour period. If anything, his football resume and family tree looks good.

It began with the University of Washington edge rusher missing Thursday's Husky practice and sharing in the birth of his son, Kasyn, his second child to go with a daughter.

It continued with the one-time Texas A&M transfer and California native leading the Huskies in tackles with 9 in their 49-39 shootout win over Arizona on Saturday afternoon.
