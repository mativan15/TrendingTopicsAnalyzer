Minnesota United set a club record for road victories with six this season, including at LA Galaxy, New York Red Bulls, Nashville, Vancouver and Monday's playoff opponent FC Dallas.

The old record was in 2019, when the team went 5-10-2 away from Allianz Field with MLS Defender of the Year Ike Opara and Goalkeeper of the Year Vito Mannone down its defensive spine.

Does that mean the 2022 Loons are a good road team?

"We can be," coach Adrian Heath said. "We can be."

They were on May 22 when they went to FC Dallas and won 2-1 after they scored the game's first two goals in the first 55 minutes.
