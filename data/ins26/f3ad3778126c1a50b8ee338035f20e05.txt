Insurance claims for weather-related property damage have risen 34% in the past six months, and could be about to go a lot higher. IAG, the parent company of insurance brands AMI, State and NZI, said there had been 13,587 weather-related claims in the past six months. Serious flooding in the Nelson region resulted in over $20 million worth of claims to IAG's brands. IAG did not disclose a national figure of claims so far this year. But IAG chief meteorologist, Dr Bruce Buckley​ said the worst may be yet to come.
