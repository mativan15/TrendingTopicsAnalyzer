Sergi Alexander/Getty Images Entertainment Investment Thesis BARK (NYSE:BARK) shares have jumped as much as 120% since I last covered the company in June. The company reported better-than-expected profitability results in its first quarter. The business is still losing money, and this investment is highly speculative. But I think that the company's outlook is moving in the right direction. I still think that BARK shares have considerable upside potential if the company manages to reach profitability.
