Dear Pay Dirt,  My girlfriend moved in with me very shortly after we started dating six months ago. At first, it was a 'stay at your place every night' thing—she works in the airline industry and is regularly out of town for several days each week. Three months ago, I bought a house (on a teacher salary, no less!) and invited her to move in with the mindset that her paying rent would help defray the cost of the mortgage.
