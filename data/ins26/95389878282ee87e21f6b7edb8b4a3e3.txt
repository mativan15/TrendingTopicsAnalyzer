Madonna made a name for herself as a carnal dance-floor diva with a penchant for bucking the status quo. But would you believe there was a time her pop provocations failed to climax?

In the early '90s, Madonna was reaching her pop-cultural zenith. Her 1990 Blond Ambition world tour drew the ire of Pope John Paul II, who protested the show's brash melding of Catholicism and sex. The tour's accompanying documentary, 1991's 'Madonna: Truth or Dare,' broke ground with its LGBTQ+-inclusive cast.

Madonna's music began to reflect this rebellion in her 1990 single 'Justify My Love,' whose not-safe-for-MTV music video explored themes of S&M and bisexuality.
