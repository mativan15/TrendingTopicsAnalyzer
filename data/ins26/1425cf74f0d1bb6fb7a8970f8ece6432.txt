Published October 21, 2022 11:00am EDT The U.S. federal budget deficit fell by half for the 2022 financial year as once-aggressive pandemic relief spending dried up, the Treasury Department said on Friday.  The gap between what the government spent and what it collected tumbled to $1.375 trillion at the end of September, down from the 2021 deficit of $2.776 trillion. The decline would have been steeper if it were not for the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness plan: Education Department spending for the year totaled $639.
