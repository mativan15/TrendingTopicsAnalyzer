As the country celebrates tradition and prepares for change, one major shift is closer than ever – our move towards becoming a cashless society. It is hard to imagine money without the Queen's profile proudly embossed, defining our Elizabethan generation in a centuries-old British tradition, but the monarch's face is fast disappearing from our pockets.
Many of us rarely use cash now at all and increasingly, shops, cafes and transport providers refuse to accept it. Card and contactless payments already outweigh cash payments in the UK.
