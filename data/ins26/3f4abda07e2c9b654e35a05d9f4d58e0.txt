Over 450 people gathered Wednesday night to celebrate the 40 Under 40 class of 2022 at Armature Works in Tampa.

Tampa Bay Business Journal's 40 Under 40 awards honor businesspeople demonstrating excellence in their careers and in the local community. It's the first time the event has been held since the Covid-19 pandemic began.

Over 500 nominations were received and narrowed down by the Business Journal's internal judging panel.

This year's honorees, in partnership with Habitat for Humanity of Pinellas and West Pasco Counties, will have the opportunity to participate in the Business Journal's inaugural 40 Under 40 Build Day in November.
