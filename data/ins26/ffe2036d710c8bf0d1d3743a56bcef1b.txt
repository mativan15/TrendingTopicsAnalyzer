In the housebuyer rush from cities to the countryside, property search nets have been cast far and wide, pushing up sales in previously overlooked counties.
This approach – of choosing more off-the-beaten track locations, helped in part by more flexible working patterns – has drawn buyers to areas where they can find far more value for money.
Sue Cunningham is one such buyer. Members of her family had lived in the same two connected cottages in Farnham, Surrey, for 200 years. When her parents became ill, she left her job as a teaching assistant for children with special needs and established Sunny by Sue, an online business that sells hand-decorated glasswear.
