Prosecutors said Southall, who led First Emanuel Baptist Church in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, solicited and then stole tithes and donations from church members. In one instance, Southall took a $10,000 tithe from a congregant in 2019, then diverted the money to his own use, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reported. In another, he solicited donations from church members over four years for charity and church building improvements but converted $106,408 of the donations to his own accounts, the newspaper said.
