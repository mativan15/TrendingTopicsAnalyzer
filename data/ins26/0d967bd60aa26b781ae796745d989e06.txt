The NHL on Thursday unveiled the Reverse Retro jerseys for all 32 teams for the 2022-23 season, and the Florida Panthers' uniform is taking it back to 1998.

According to the NHL, the Reverse Retro jerseys are meant to 'remix nostalgic elements of each club's past in combinations that honor history and tradition while delivering a new experience for fans.'

The Panthers' jersey is light blue, similar to their third jerseys from the 2009 season, with the center crest showcasing the iconic sun, crossed palm tree and stick logo that appeared on the shoulder of the 1998 jersey.
