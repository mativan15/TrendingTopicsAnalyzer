At a time when the ed-tech industry sees several layoffs and the shutting down of companies, Ronnie Screwvala, chairperson and co-founder of upGrad, says that a 'maturity in the industry was long-time coming'. As the world faces uncertainty because of multiple macro-economic factors, Screwvala says it is time for the right models to emerge. Excerpts from an interview.
As things return to normalcy, what kind of changes will the ed-tech industry see and what are the challenges before it post Covid-19? How do you see things pan out in the foreseeable future?
