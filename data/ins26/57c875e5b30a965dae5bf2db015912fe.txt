FBI whistleblower Steve Friend shared revelations of the agency's alleged conduct on Saturday's "Unfiltered with Dan Bongino" after what he said was his experience.Friend had been working as a field agent in Florida when he said he noticed "rules were not being followed as they are laid out in our guidance for carrying out investigations" for tracking down January 6 participants. He said he made a protective disclosure to his supervisor in August 2021 to raise those concerns ahead of arrest-and-search operations on certain subjects.
