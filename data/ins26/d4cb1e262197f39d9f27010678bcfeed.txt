Dorit Kemsley has hit back at Erika Jayne Girardi's prediction that she will be the next Bravo divorce.
The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star married the businessman in 2015 and the pair share children Jagger and Phoenix together.
There has been nothing to suggest that the couple are anything but loved up, but Erika may think differently…
During an appearance at BravoCon over the weekend, the 51-year-old was asked for her thoughts on the current state of the Bravo couples, and which relationship is ‘heading to splitsville next,' according to Page Six.
