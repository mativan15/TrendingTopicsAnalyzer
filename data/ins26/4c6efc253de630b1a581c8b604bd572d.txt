I say Elon Musk, you say —Money. Lots and lots and lots of money.Yes, I suppose that is rather bang-on given that he was recognised as the world's richest man this year.Exactly. A fortune of $225 billion. What else is there to know?Actually, he has a new girlfriend.Oh. I thought he had one? Grime?Grimes.There was more than one? Clones? Makes sense.No, her name — well, stage name — is Grimes. And yes, they were together for three years and have two children. The first, a boy, is called X Æ A-Xii.Would love to know how that is pronounced.
