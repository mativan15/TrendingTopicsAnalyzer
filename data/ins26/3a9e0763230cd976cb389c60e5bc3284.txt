Crypto volatility might be way down, prompting warnings from analysts about investor interest in the digital-asset sector. Crypto volatility might be way down, prompting warnings from analysts about investor interest in the digital-asset sector. But it's not volatility that matters -- it's volumes. That's according to crypto trading firm Cumberland, which says that volumes, while off the highs of the year, 'remain absolutely massive.' Roughly $50 billion worth of Bitcoin derivatives -- excluding spot and on-chain, as well as non-Bitcoin related activity -- are cleared on exchanges each day, prompting the firm to posit that daily activity in crypto may be more than $100 billion, about one-fifth the figure for US stocks.
