The Reserve Bank of India has lifted a three year ban on Tamilnadu Mercantile Bank (TMB) that prevented the banker from opening new branches. "With reference to our letter dated March 25, 2021 on the captioned subject, RBI vide letter Ref.No.DoR.HOL.No.S4688/16.01.075/2022-23 dated October 21, 2022, has lifted the restriction on branch opening with effect from October 21, 2022, as the Bank's shares were listed in the Stock Exchanges on September 15, 2022," read a TMB letter. 
The restrictions on opening new branches will be rescinded with effect from October 21, with the bank's shares being listed just a month earlier on the stock exchange.
