Diablo: Immortal will no longer be released in Belgium or the Netherlands due to lootboxes being illegal in both countries.The long-awaited mobile (and now PC) game finally arrives on June 2 but developer Activision Blizzard cancelled the launch in the two European countries just days before their release date.As reported by gamesindustry.biz and confirmed to Eurogamer, Diablo Immortal will not be available there due to "the current operating conditions in these countries", as Belgium and the Netherlands both deem lootboxes to be gambling and they're therefore illegal.
