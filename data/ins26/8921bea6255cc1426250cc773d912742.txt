Winnebago announced fourth quarter results that were better than expected, but Chief Executive Michael Happe warned that rising interest rates and uncertain economic conditions means that demand in 2023 will likely soften.

Shares of the Eden Prairie-based company were down over 10% midday. Net income was down 1.8% to $82.6 million, but earnings per share increased 6.5% to $2.61 a share.

Adjusted quarterly earnings were $3.02 a share, better than the $2.76 expected by analysts. Revenue also topped expectations.
