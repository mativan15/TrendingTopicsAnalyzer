With just over a week to go until the unveiling of its critical turnaround plan, Credit Suisse Group AG executives are probing every corner of the business for ways to raise funds - and preparing to tap outside investors in case they need more. The Zurich-based bank is working with Royal Bank of Canada and Morgan Stanley on a potential capital increase, should it need raise funds for its restructuring, according to people familiar with matter. Those discussions buttress efforts to dispose of some areas of the business, likely to include large parts of the investment bank and potentially asset management in the US.
