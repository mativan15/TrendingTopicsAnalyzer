By Colin Kellaher Zosano Pharma Corp. has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with plans for an orderly wind down of the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, it said Thursday. The Fremont, Calif., company, which last month warned that it would need a substantial cash infusion to stay in business, plans to sell substantially all of its assets during the bankruptcy case, it said. Zosano in April said it was suspending its M207 lead program in migraine and cutting staff in a bid to preserve cash.
