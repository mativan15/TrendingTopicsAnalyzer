What's happening in the financial and external sectors?Mumbai: A sense of relief appears to be emerging on the magnitude of future interest rate increases by the Reserve , thanks to Monetary Policy Committee's external members Jayanth Varma and Ashima Goyal. When the conservative Varma suggests repo rate at 6% is good enough for a pause, it's a sufficient signal that the RBI is close to peak interest rate, for now. After a fourth straight increase, the repo rate is at 5.9%. To add weight to Varma's stance, Goyal said the MPC may end up overdoing the increases, hurting the economy.
