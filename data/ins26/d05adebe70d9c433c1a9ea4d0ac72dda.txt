What I've Learned is a series in which Stuff asks businesspeople what they have learned from their years in business, and tips for other business owners on their journey. Rickie Dee and James Rigden started fashion retailer Superette over 20 years ago. Despite starting as two 20-year-olds with no clue, the store has found great success with 30% year-on-year revenue growth. They see no dead end for bricks and mortar either and plan to open four more in the next four years. Rigden shares what he learned along the way.
