For £1.25 million you could become the owner of a five-bedroom period home – as well as two planes, a submarine, igloo and UFO spaceship.
Tony Rhys-Davies Jones, 50, is the current owner of Apple Camping – but visitors don't sleep in tents.
They can pick between one of the many weird and wonderful accommodation options across the site – which includes jet planes, a speedboat, UFO spaceship, submarine and igloo.
But now, the campsite, near Redberth, Pembrokeshire, is up for sale, and it could be yours for a mere £1.
