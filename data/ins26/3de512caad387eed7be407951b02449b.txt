Interest rate rises have reduced how much money buyers are able to borrow, and experts are predicting major falls in property prices.

This will place greater pressure on first home buyers juggling the difficult decision of when to enter the property market, financial comparison site Canstar said.

The latest house price predictions from NAB and ANZ forecast total property price falls of around 20 per cent across the capital cities by April 2023 - from their peak in April this year.
